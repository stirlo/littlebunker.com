Nature Climate Change, Published online: 18 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02500-0Climate change threatens biodiversity, but the transfer of genes between species via hybridization can enhance climate resilience. This research demonstrates that hybrid mountain birds show reduced climate vulnerability, highlighting how maintaining natural gene flow can mitigate extinction risks and is crucial for conserving species with narrow environmental tolerances.
