Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 30, July 2025. SignificanceBiopolymer degradation is essential for carbon cycling, yet the roles of nondegrading microbes and the mechanisms by which degraders limit resource exploitation remain unclear. Our study reveals roles for nondegraders in expanding the niches ...
