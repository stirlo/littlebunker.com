Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceThis study reveals how ESCC cells manipulate TAMs to promote tumor progression. We found that tumor-secreted cholesterol triggers a molecular network in macrophages (TFEB-PLD3-TLR9 axis), suppressing their ability to activate antitumor T ...
