Abstract Electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves have been analyzed using different satellite data. However, single‐mission studies prevent a systematic understanding of the emissions in Earth's magnetosphere. We perform a comprehensive survey of ECH waves using observations from Van Allen Probes, Arase, and MMS satellites spanning over 2012–2023. Our results indicate that these waves cover a broad spatial region of L = 3–15, |MLAT| 6) exhibit dayside‐maximized occurrence rates. Wave amplitudes are strongest on the nightside but display a secondary pre‐noon peak at L > 8. In addition, ECH waves are predominantly confined near the equator (|MLAT| < 5°) at L < ∼8, in contrast to the much broader latitudinal distribution (|MLAT| < 35°) at higher L.
