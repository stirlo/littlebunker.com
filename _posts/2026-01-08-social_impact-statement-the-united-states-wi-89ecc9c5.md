WASHINGTON, DC (January 7, 2026) - Today, President Trump&nbsp;signed a presidential memorandum directing the United States to withdraw from 66 international organizations and treaties, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.&nbsp;The following statement is from David Widawsky, Director, WRI US:&nbsp;“Pulling out of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change is a strategic blunder that gives away American advantage for nothing in return. The 30-year-old agreement is the foundation of international climate cooperation. Walking away doesn’t just put America on the sidelines — it takes the U.S. out of the arena entirely.&nbsp;“American communities and businesses will lose economic ground as other countries capture the jobs, wealth, and trade created by the booming clean-energy economy.&nbsp;“Despite today’s action, global climate diplomacy will not falter. Other nations understand the UNFCCC’s irreplaceable role in driving cooperation and advancing climate solutions the world urgently needs. When countries work together on climate, it saves lives, creates jobs, strengthens economic stability, and builds a more prosperous future.” &nbsp;&nbsp;
