Abstract The Martian magnetosheath acts as a conduit for mass and energy transfer between the upstream solar wind and its induced magnetosphere. However, our understanding of its global properties remains limited. Using 9 years of data from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis to explore the spatial distribution of the magnetic fields, solar wind and planetary ions in the magnetosheath. We discovered significant asymmetries in the magnetic field, solar wind protons, and planetary ions between the quasi‐perpendicular and quasi‐parallel magnetosheaths. The asymmetries in the Martian magnetosheath exhibit both similarities and differences compared to those in the Earth's and Venus' magnetosheaths. These results indicate that the Martian magnetosheath is distinctly shaped by both shock geometry and planetary ions.
