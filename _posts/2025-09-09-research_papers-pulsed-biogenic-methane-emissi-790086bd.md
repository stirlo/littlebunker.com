Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 36, September 2025. SignificanceLarge-scale release of biogenic methane has the potential to contribute to significant climate change, yet its role during hyperthermal events remains debated. Our results demonstrate that biogenic methane release played a pivotal role during ...
