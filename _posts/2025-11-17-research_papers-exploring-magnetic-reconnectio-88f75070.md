Abstract Magnetic reconnection in collisional plasmas has been widely studied in solar and laboratory plasma disciplines, but in situ measurements in space plasmas have rarely been utilized to explore this reconnection regime. Here we study collisional effects on magnetic reconnection in the Martian ionosphere by analyzing in situ data obtained by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. A case study and statistical results demonstrate that current sheets are commonly observed in both collisionless and collisional regions in the Martian ionosphere. Meanwhile, reconnection ion jets become hardly detectable in collisional current sheets, suggesting suppression of reconnection outflows by ion‐neutral friction effects. MAVEN observations allow us to access multiple regimes of magnetic reconnection, thereby providing valuable opportunities for cross‐disciplinary studies of collisional reconnection.
