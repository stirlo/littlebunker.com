Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceProtein oligomers formed from hIAPP are a likely cytotoxic species that drive β-cell loss in type 2 diabetes. We report an atomic structural model of an hIAPP oligomer using a combination of multidimensional IR and NMR spectroscopy. The ...
