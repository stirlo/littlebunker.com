As the US Congress returns to Washington, D.C. today to vote to end the government shut down, Climate Justice Alliance executive director, KD Chavez, issued the following statement: “As this intentional shutdown comes to a close, we must acknowledge that the continued harm on hard-working families, our local communities, and the natural places we all love continues. With grocery prices and everyday costs still too high, and essential programs for our seniors, veterans, and neighborhoods continuing to be cut, big corporations are getting tax breaks and a free pass to pollute our communities. We need Congress to act with sensitivity and urgency to come to the table with a spending plan that puts our health and well-being first, protects affordable healthcare and food access, and safeguards our clean air and water for future generations. It’s time for our elected leaders to stop rewarding special interests and their record profits. Enough is enough.” The post Climate Justice Alliance Calls on Congress to Put People and Planet First as Shutdown Ends appeared first on Climate Justice Alliance.
