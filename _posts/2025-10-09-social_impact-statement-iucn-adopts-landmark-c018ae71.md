ABU DHABI (October 9, 2025) — Today, at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, IUCN members adopted a landmark Resolution on Crimes that Affect the Environment.The resolution recognizes environmental crime as a major threat to biodiversity and human rights, and calls for stronger cooperation between governments, law enforcement agencies and the global conservation community to tackle crimes such as illegal logging, deforestation, mining, fishing and wildlife trafficking.Through the Nature Crime Alliance, World Resources Institute — alongside the Government of France, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the National Whistleblower Center, and the International Council on Environmental Law — developed the resolution, which received strong support among IUCN members.Following is a statement from Dr. Charles ‘Chip’ Barber, Director, Nature Crime Alliance, World Resources Institute:“Environmental crime is now one of the world’s most profitable illegal enterprises. It fuels deforestation, drives biodiversity loss, and causes immense human suffering — stealing resources and revenue from communities and countries alike.“This resolution is a breakthrough because it puts action against these crimes squarely on the conservation agenda. It signals growing resolve among IUCN members to confront environmental crime as a serious threat to people, nature and climate.“The resolution provides a mandate for IUCN to incorporate efforts to tackle environmental crime within its workplan and encourages governments to address this issue at the national level.“This is a milestone that lays the groundwork for stronger global cooperation on environmental crime, aligns IUCN’s efforts with other international frameworks and fora, and builds momentum heading into the UN Crime Congress in 2026.”
