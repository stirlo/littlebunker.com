Abstract We present high‐resolution rupture imaging of the 2025 MW 7.7 Myanmar earthquake using global teleseismic P‐waves and regional‐distance Rayleigh waves. Most radiated energy was released near the epicenter within the first 20 s, followed by bilateral rupture propagation along the central Sagaing Fault, extending ∼350 km southward and ∼100 km northward, with sustained supershear speeds (∼4.6–5.0 km/s) in both directions. Global P‐wave back‐projection captures the overall rupture extent and energy evolution, while fault‐limited regional Rayleigh‐wave back‐projection using data from the dense Southern Yunnan array in China resolves finer segmentation and timing. The event's low apparent stress and its occurrence along a long, straight, strain‐accumulated fault segment are consistent with a mature fault system and supershear rupture behavior. This study demonstrates the complementary strengths of global teleseismic and regional‐distance arrays and underscores the value of integrated seismic imaging for rapid response and hazard assessment in active tectonic regions.
