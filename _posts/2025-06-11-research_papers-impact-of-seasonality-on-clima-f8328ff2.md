Abstract Most previous studies on marine cloud brightening (MCB) have focused on deployment over the subtropical stratocumulus cloud decks which persistently result in non‐uniform cooling and disruption of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A recent study demonstrated that MCB deployment over mid‐latitudes, instead, could alleviate such side effects. Here, with the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), we investigate the impact of seasonality on the mid‐latitude MCB deployment strategy. Specifically, efficacy of MCB, induced response in surface temperature and precipitation patterns, and ENSO are examined. The results suggest that (a) single hemisphere MCB deployment in midlatitude regions shifts the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and (b) midlatitude MCB deployment over both hemispheres during fall and winter delivers climate outcomes with the least side effects.
