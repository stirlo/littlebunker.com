Nature Climate Change, Published online: 18 July 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02377-zTerrestrial ecosystems are expected to release more carbon under warming due to temperature-driven increases in ecosystem respiration. Here the authors use eddy covariance data to show that respiration may adapt to warmer temperatures and carbon losses may be lower than expected.
