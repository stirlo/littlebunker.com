Abstract The convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates beneath the Pamir Plateau has produced complex continental subduction, significantly influencing upper crustal faulting and seismicity. To investigate the kinematic behavior of the High Pamir Plateau, we derive a geodetic slip model for the 2023 Mw 6.9 Pamir earthquake by using Sentinel‐1A and ALOS‐2 InSAR data. Our geodetic inversion reveals rupture along two distinct faults: a dominant left‐lateral strike‐slip fault and a secondary normal fault, consistent with the mechanisms of the 1911 Mw 7.3 and 2015 Mw 7.2 earthquakes in the region. Notably, the 2015 and 2023 ruptures extend to ∼20 km depth—deeper than typical Tibetan Plateau earthquakes—likely due to the thermal influence of the underlying cratonic lithosphere. Our results also indicate a broad shear zone above the underthrusting Indian plate, underscoring the role of lithospheric‐scale dynamics in shaping crustal fault behavior in the Pamir region.
