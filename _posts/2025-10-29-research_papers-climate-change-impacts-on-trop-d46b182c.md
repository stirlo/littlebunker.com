Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 43, October 2025. SignificanceThis study integrates advanced modeling approaches to project risks of tropical cyclone–induced power outages under changing climate conditions. Combining climate simulations, machine learning, distributional impact, and economic analyses, ...
