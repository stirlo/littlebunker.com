Abstract As precipitation infiltrates into soils, it can recharge them, displace previously stored waters, or bypass already‐filled pores. Using 3,697 δ2H and δ18O measurements of water collected nearly monthly over >3 years in 47 forest plots across Switzerland, we present a systematic investigation of the controls on mobile soil water transport. We quantified the lags and damping of water as it percolates downward using young water fraction analysis (Fyw), and the fractions of soil water composed by precipitation that fell within the previous month (new water fractions, Fnew). The Fnew of water sampled in surface soils ranged widely, from 0% to 50%, but those fractions typically decreased with depth and converged on values of 0%–20% at depths below 80 cm. Soil characteristics explained much of the variation in Fyw and Fnew, as did climatological and root characteristics to a lesser, but still statistically significant, degree.
