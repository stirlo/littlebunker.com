Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceTrees play key roles in terrestrial ecosystems but are sensitive to large climatic changes. Our work quantifies end-of-century climate change exposure–shifts to species’ currently unoccupied climate zones–for 32,089 tree species globally. ...
