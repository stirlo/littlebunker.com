Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. SignificanceInvestigation of the in vivo function of microRNAs has been precluded by the lack of genetic tools. In this work, we provide experimental evidence demonstrating the efficiency, specificity, versatility, and functional relevance of Cas9 editing ...
