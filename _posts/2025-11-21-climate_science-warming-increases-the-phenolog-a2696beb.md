Nature Climate Change, Published online: 21 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02474-zMeasurements of carbon fluxes and wood phenology are used to assess carbon sources from photosynthesis and their sink into woody growth along a thermal gradient. The authors show that stem growth advances slower than photosynthesis per degree Celsius, creating a phenological mismatch for carbon.
