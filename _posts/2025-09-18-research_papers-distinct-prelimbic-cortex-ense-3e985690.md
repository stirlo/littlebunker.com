Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 37, September 2025. SignificanceUntil recently, the question of how neuronal ensembles support behavioral flexibility in the face of changing contingencies has remained unanswered. Using longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging, rat-specific decoders, and in silico ensemble ...
