Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 30, July 2025. SignificanceSelf-labeling protein tags (SLPs) are popular tools in fluorescence imaging, particularly in applications requiring high photon budgets. Previously, efforts to improve the photostability of dye-tag systems have primarily focused on the ...
