São Paulo (January 29, 2026) —&nbsp;World Resources Institute (WRI) today announced the appointment of Mirela Sandrini as Executive Director of WRI&nbsp;Brasil, following her successful tenure as Interim Executive Director.&nbsp;Based in São Paulo, Sandrini brings more than two decades of leadership in sustainability,&nbsp;philanthropy&nbsp;and public policy, with&nbsp;deep&nbsp;experience working to advance socio-environmental solutions through collaboration with government, civil&nbsp;society&nbsp;and the private sector.&nbsp;During her interim tenure, she led WRI&nbsp;Brasil&nbsp;through a period of growth and strategic consolidation, strengthening and expanding the organization’s influence at a pivotal moment for&nbsp;Brasil’s&nbsp;leadership on the global climate and nature agenda, including during the country’s hosting of COP30.&nbsp;Building on this foundation, Sandrini will continue to lead a renewed country strategy and guide a team of&nbsp;nearly 160&nbsp;professionals working to redesign cities, transform food, land and water systems, and accelerate&nbsp;Brasil’s&nbsp;transition to a low-carbon economy.&nbsp;“This is a consequential moment for&nbsp;Brasil, with decisions shaping global emissions, biodiversity and the future of the Amazon,” said&nbsp;Adriana Lobo, Managing Director of Global Presence and National Action, World Resources Institute. “Mirela brings the judgment and steadiness this moment demands, along with deep insight into&nbsp;Brasil’s&nbsp;policy landscape. She has earned the trust of staff, partners and the Board, and we are pleased to confirm her as Executive Director.”&nbsp;“Mirela’s year as Acting Director involved&nbsp;especially&nbsp;close coordination with the WRI&nbsp;Brasil&nbsp;Board as the organization navigated change,” said Johannes van de Ven, President of the WRI&nbsp;Brasil&nbsp;Board. “Her ability to lead that process — working constructively with the Board — reinforced sound governance and continuity at a critical time.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;what gives us confidence in her appointment as Executive Director.”&nbsp;Prior to serving as Interim Executive Director, Sandrini was Forest and Land Use Director at WRI&nbsp;Brasil. She previously held senior leadership roles in philanthropy and sustainability, including as Regional Director for Latin America at Porticus, where she helped shape the organization’s regional strategy with a focus on climate change, human&nbsp;rights&nbsp;and education.&nbsp;“It’s an honor to&nbsp;continue leading WRI&nbsp;Brasil&nbsp;at such a defining moment,” said&nbsp;Sandrini. “I’m&nbsp;grateful for the trust placed in me and proud of our team’s work. Our focus now is on turning evidence into action — showing that&nbsp;Brasil&nbsp;can protect its natural wealth, build a competitive low-carbon economy and lead globally on climate and development.”&nbsp;Sandrini holds a master’s degree in Sustainability from&nbsp;Fundação&nbsp;Getulio Vargas (São Paulo) and an MBA in Business Management from&nbsp;Ibmec&nbsp;(Rio de Janeiro).&nbsp;About&nbsp;World&nbsp;Resources Institute (WRI)&nbsp; &nbsp;WRI works to improve people’s lives, protect and restore nature and stabilize the climate.
