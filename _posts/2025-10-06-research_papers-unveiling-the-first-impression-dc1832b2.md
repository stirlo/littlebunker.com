Abstract The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission offers novel global observations of river hydrodynamics, yet its performance across varied river morphologies remains understudied. We evaluate SWOT node and raster products over a ∼210 km stretch of the Ganga River, India, during the fast‐sampling phase, using GNSS‐based continuous measurements, two in situ stations, and four altimetry virtual stations. Node products show slightly better water surface elevation (WSE) accuracy than raster products, with RMSEs of 0.19 m (GNSS), 0.09 m (in situ station, Varanasi), and 0.88 m (virtual stations), though quality filters reduce temporal resolution. Raster data, however, captures 2D WSE variability, enhancing spatial sampling in wide river cross‐sections. SWOT‐derived water surface slopes (WSS) yield mixed results across SWORD reaches (RMSE: 2.54 cm/km). Strong backscatter from main river channel waters (mean +13.34 dB) aids width retrieval. Our analysis highlights SWOT's potential for river hydrodynamic applications while underscoring the need of evaluation in complex riverine environments.
