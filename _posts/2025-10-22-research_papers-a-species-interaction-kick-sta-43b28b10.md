Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 42, October 2025. SignificanceNew species arise as populations evolve reproductive isolation, a process that typically starts in geographic isolation (allopatry). However, whether and how ecological differences in allopatry promote speciation remains unclear. We study ...
