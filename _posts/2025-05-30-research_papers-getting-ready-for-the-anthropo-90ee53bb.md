This paper describes three phases that cities go through for the delivery of municipal water and sanitation services, identifying the main political, technological, socio-institutional, financial, public health forces of disequilibria that push cities along this development path. Data from the Global Water Intelligence and the World Bankâ€™s International Benchmarking Network show that most of the countries with utilities with limited piped water coverage (Phase 1) have an annual GDP per capita less than US$5000. In contrast, most countries with an annual GDP per capita greater than US$10 000 have close to universal piped water coverage (Phase 3). We find no statistically significant relationship between country-level water scarcity and the average water prices charged by utilities in a country. We discuss a comprehensive policy mix with four components that municipal water utilities need to address the growing water deficits as rising demands confront limited supplies: (1) reduction of nonrevenue water, (2) source diversification, (3) reduction of customer water use, and (4) establishment of financial reserves to address climate-related emergencies.
