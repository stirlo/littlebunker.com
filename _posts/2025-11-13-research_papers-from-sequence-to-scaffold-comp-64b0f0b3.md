Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 45, November 2025. SignificanceSelf-assembling protein nanoparticle vaccines have steadily gained traction in both academic and industry vaccine development over the last decade. Recent work has shown that computationally designing self-assembling proteins allows the ...
