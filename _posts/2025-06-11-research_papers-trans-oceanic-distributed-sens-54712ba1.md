Abstract Geophysical sensing in the open ocean is both costly and technically challenging. Here we developed a novel distributed fiber optic sensing technique that employs microwave modulation for phase measurement in signals returned from submarine repeaters. We transformed a trans‐Atlantic telecom cable into an 81‐sensor array and measured sub‐millihertz strains. The strains correlate with ocean tide height variations in phase, suggesting a dominant factor of the cable's Poisson's effect. Large strains observed at fiber spans located in the shallow water match the strong variations of simulated seafloor temperature. This study presents the first experimental confirmation of detecting sub‐millihertz signals using trans‐oceanic distributed sensing with submarine cables at span‐wise spatial resolution (∼80 km), opening the potential for cost‐efficient tsunami early warning and long‐term ocean temperature monitoring compatible with active data‐carrying fibers.
