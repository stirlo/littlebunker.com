What would happen if a nuclear war triggered a climate-altering catastrophe? Researchers have modeled how such a scenario could devastate global corn crops cutting production by as much as 87% due to blocked sunlight and increased UV-B radiation. Using advanced climate-agriculture simulations, they propose a survival strategy: emergency resilience kits containing fast-growing, cold-tolerant seeds that could keep food systems afloat not just after nuclear war, but also after volcanic eruptions or other mega-disasters.
