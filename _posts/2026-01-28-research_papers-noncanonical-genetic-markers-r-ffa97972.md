Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 4, January 2026. SignificanceUnderstanding when life adapted to oxygen is key to unraveling Earth’s evolutionary history. By developing a machine learning model that uses 40 conserved genes, mostly unrelated to oxygen processing, we overcome limitations of traditional ...
