Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceIntensifying stressors are weakening resilience in ecosystems across the globe. Here, we show that belowground biomass (BGB), a proxy for salt marsh health, has decreased over a large area of coastal marshes since 2014, indicating growing ...
