Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 41, October 2025. SignificanceGenerative modeling has enabled novel approaches to the design of functional molecules. However, its practical utility has been impeded by its tendency to propose molecules that are difficult or impossible to synthesize. To address this issue, ...
