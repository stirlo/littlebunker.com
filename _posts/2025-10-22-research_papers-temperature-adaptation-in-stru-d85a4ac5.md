Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 42, October 2025. SignificanceSubstitutions in a few amino acids can significantly alter the structural and functional responses of enzymes to temperature, traits that are closely related to establishing the thermal optima and limits of organisms. A cross-taxa analysis of ...
