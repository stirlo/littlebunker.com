Solar photovoltaic (PV) power provides low-carbon renewable energy to reach ambitious carbon neutrality goals. Atmospheric aerosol-induced changes in surface solar radiation and air temperature have profoundly influenced solar energy in China in recent decades. However, the solar PV power generation losses caused by aerosol pollution in China remain unclear. Here, we combined multi-model ensemble simulations from multiple Earth system models with different anthropogenic emission scenarios and the latest information from 14 072 solar plants in China to evaluate the impact of aerosol pollution on solar energy. Our results show that aerosol pollution mitigation can improve solar PV generation in China. Compared with preindustrial anthropogenic emission levels, aerosol pollution may reduce annual mean solar PV power generation by up to 48.13 TWh across the 14 072 solar plants in China. Notably, even low pollution levels can cause substantial generation losses in northwestern China because of their extensive installed capacity. Moreover, negative effects of aerosol pollution on solar energy will exist in the future. Our study highlights the importance of aerosol pollution mitigation for enhanced renewable energy in China.
