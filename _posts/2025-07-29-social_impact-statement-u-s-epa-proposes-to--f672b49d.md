July 29, 2025 (Washington, DC) — Today in Indianapolis, where the heat index was expected to exceed 100 degrees and approach an all-time high, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a new proposal that will make it harder for the EPA and future administrations to manage and oversee greenhouse gas emissions, pollution that results from burning fossil fuels.EPA’s new rule seeks to overturn the agency’s own scientific finding which concluded that greenhouse gas pollution endangers human health and thus requires regulation and oversight to protect people and the environment.Following is a statement from World Resources Institute (WRI) U.S. Director David Widawsky:\\"Every person in the country should be alarmed that EPA is proposing to walk away from its responsibility to protect America’s citizens and their wallets.“Most Americans have never heard of this provision — called “endangerment” — yet it is extremely important to their everyday lives. Repealing this provision will have vast impacts on Americans’ lives: it will make it harder for people to deal with rising household energy bills, harder to address health problems from extreme heatwaves, and harder for businesses to succeed in a changing climate. Decades of EPA’s own science demonstrate that managing greenhouse gases is fundamental to protecting Americans’ health.“These safeguards were the result of thorough scientific and economic analysis. Rolling them back would be a dangerous breach of EPA’s responsibility to protect people, the environment, and our economy. WRI plans to submit public comment on this proposal that benefits some polluters at the expense of all people.”
