Abstract Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are elongated structures in the atmosphere that transport water vapor from the tropics to mid‐ and high‐latitudes in highly episodic events. ARs are a major source of precipitation in the western United States and many other regions of the world and play a role in air‐sea exchanges of heat and freshwater in the subtropics. For the first time, an experiment was designed to observe (open) ocean changes during AR precipitation, using profiling floats in the northeast subtropical Pacific. Results show upper ocean freshening and cooling with AR precipitation (lasting several hours), especially when surface winds are low (≈6 ${\\approx} 6$ m/s). ARs contribute 70%–90% $\\%$ of the total winter precipitation in the subtropical northeast Pacific: a salt budget analysis (using ECCO) shows that precipitation over winter is the main driver of ocean freshening in the top 25–30 m and contributes by ≈30% ${\\approx} 30\\%$ to the integrated changes in the top ≈55 ${\\approx} 55$ m.
