Abstract The uplift history of the Gangdese arc in Southern Tibet is fundamental to understanding when and how the plateau attained its current elevation and topographic relief. Detrital multi‐mineral provenance analysis of the Oligocene–Miocene strata in the intermontane Wuyu Basin provides new key information on the paleodrainage evolution in response to topographic changes. A Qiangtang source affinity is inferred by detrital apatite and zircon provenance, indicating a distal major eastern source at 31 Ma. The west‐flowing drainage system implies Oligocene lowlands in the Gangdese arc, probably related to regional subsidence. The shift of provenance to Linzizong volcanic rocks indicates that the Gangdese arc underwent uplift since 23 Ma, which became rapid at 15 Ma due to complete delamination of the subducted Indian continental lithosphere, as inferred by abundant syn‐sedimentary zircon and apatite. The accelerated uplift and topographic changes provide independent constraints on the Tibetan Plateau growth and associated geodynamic processes.
