Abstract Potential drivers disrupting mid‐Proterozoic (∼1.8–0.8 Ga) environmental stasis remain poorly constrained. Here we examined carbonate Li isotopes from the ∼1.44 Ga Tieling Formation, North China, to evaluate the effects of continental chemical weathering on coeval oxygenation. Our results identify two negative excursions in seawater δ7Li values, suggesting enhanced continental chemical weathering. Applying a dynamic box model, we demonstrate that 2.5‐fold increase in riverine Li influx coupled with decrease in riverine δ7Li by 6‰ can generate the observed data pattern. Intermittently enhanced continental chemical weathering could have delivered elevated nutrients to the ocean, stimulating primary productivity and thus organic carbon burial, favoring the ∼1.44 Ga oxygenation event.
