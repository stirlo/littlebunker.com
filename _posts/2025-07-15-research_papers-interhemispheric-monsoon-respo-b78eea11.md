Abstract Heinrich Stadial 4 (HS4) the most prominent iceberg collapse event of the Last Glacial and a key example for studying millennial‐scale events. Based on an improved chronological, we present high‐resolution, annually laminated speleothem record from southeastern China. Our data suggests that during the onset of HS4, the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and northern high‐latitude climate tightly coupled by the rapid southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In contrast, low temperatures in Antarctica strengthened cross‐equatorial flow, leading to a gradual weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Our records precisely date the onset of Heinrich Event 4 (HE4) at 39.70 ± 0.06 ka BP, narrowing the uncertainty in Greenland ice cores. At the onset of HE4, northern high‐latitude cooling weakened the EASM and intensified the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM), whereas the ISM declined significantly occurred only at the HE4 maximum, likely triggered by subsequent Antarctic warming.
