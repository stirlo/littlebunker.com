Notes for Editors 



What is the IPCC?



The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) is the UN body for assessing the science related to
climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide
political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate
change, its implications and risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and
mitigation strategies. In the same year the UN General Assembly endorsed the
action by the WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC. It has 195 member
states. 



Thousands of people from all
over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, scientists
and experts volunteer their time as IPCC authors to assess the thousands of
scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of
what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future
risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks. 



The IPCC has three working
groups: Working Group I,
dealing with the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II,
dealing with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III,
dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories that develops methodologies for measuring
emissions and removals. 



IPCC assessments provide
governments, at all levels, with scientific information that they can use to
develop climate policies. IPCC assessments are a key input into the
international negotiations to tackle climate change. IPCC reports are drafted
and reviewed in several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.



About the IPCC
Scholarship Programme



The
IPCC Scholarship Programme was established with the funds received from the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize, supplemented by generous contributions from other
donors.



The Programme was
further made possible through generous contributions by governments, its long-standing
funding partners, organizations and individuals. The first partner of the
Programme was Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and UN
Special Envoy on Climate Change. Funding support was provided by the
Governments of Germany and Norway. Other individuals and organizations that have
supported the programme over the years, include Aster Finance, Cheng Fa Qing,
Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Chair of the Board of Trustees), Hoesung Lee (former
IPCC Chair), The AXA Research Fund, Dickinson College,
The Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and The Cuomo Foundation.



Twenty-four
students from developing countries and countries with economies in transition
were awarded IPCC scholarships in the Seventh round (2023-2025). Since the
first awards in 2011, a total of 116 students have been supported.
