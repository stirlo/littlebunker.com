Abstract Geomorphic processes that occur after wildfires in mountainous areas require a deep understanding due to complex interactions of fire effects with the landscape surface. In situ monitoring systems can support this task, even if some limitations that affect traditional sensors can hamper their action. The current work presents an advanced multi‐sensor monitoring system composed of an all‐in‐one meteorological station, sensors to survey soil water content, a seismic station, and a pan‐tilt‐zoom video camera equipped with visible and thermal sensors enabling continuous monitoring of fire‐affected sites. The experimental technological setup successfully documented the evolution of environmental conditions during intense rainfall events in southern Italy, able to trigger post‐fire soil erosion and mass movements which were accurately detected by the system. Besides the successful outcomes demonstrating to overcome common drawbacks of in situ monitoring applications, we discuss research findings about the initiation mechanisms of the observed post‐fire geomorphic processes.
