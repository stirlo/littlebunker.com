Abstract Locally generated fast magnetosonic (local MS) waves in the Martian ionosphere have been reported recently, which are different from the solar wind‐driven MS waves. However, their effects on particle scattering have not been reported yet. This study pioneers the investigation of electron, proton, and oxygen atomic ion scattering induced by local MS waves through quasi‐linear diffusion theory. The kinetic dispersion relations of local MS waves have been applied to compute diffusion coefficients. The results demonstrate that local MS waves can efficiently scatter suprathermal electrons via Landau resonance, especially for thermal electrons propagating at large pitch angles. For ion scattering, hot protons with small pitch angles undergo effective scattering through cyclotron resonance, while oxygen atomic ions at tens of eVs are scattered through high‐order cyclotron resonance. These findings reveal the potential role played by local MS waves in the evolution of Martian ionosphere.
