Abstract Eleven unusual precursors were observed in the initial stage of a classical triggered lightning event, which was performed on CMA‐FEBLS in the summer of 2024. The amplitudes of these unusual leaders exceeded 300 A, with pulse intervals from 30 to 200 ms, while their initiation height was only about 30 m. Once these attempted leaders surpassed 250 m, they resumed the development pattern of conventional precursors. The analysis suggested that the occurrence of unusual precursors is related to the existence of the space charge layer, as the event occurred under thunderstorm conditions with sparse natural discharges, which facilitated its accumulation. When subjected to airflow or precipitation, the space charges were susceptible to localized abrupt diminution or dissipation. Such changes induced anomalous enhancements in the electric field intensity at the wire's tip as it traversed through the space charge region, ultimately leading to the occurrence of unusual precursors.
