Flooding presents a significant challenge in the Lagos metropolis, driven by rapid urbanization, poor drainage infrastructure, and climate change. This study evaluates flood resilience strategies in Lagos, analyzing their effectiveness in mitigating flood risks and their alignment with the 2030 Agenda. The research utilizes the PICO (Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes) framework to refine research questions and follows PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines for study selection, search strategies, and data extraction. A thorough search across databases such as Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and government data repositories was conducted to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies while minimizing selection bias. The study emphasizes the severe impacts of flooding, referencing the 2022â€“2023 flood event which resulted in USD 262,500 damages and displaced 8000 residents in Lagos State. Current flood resilience strategies are inadequate to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to insufficient urban flood infrastructure, poor waste disposal practices, and worsening climatic conditions. The livelihoods, income, health, and overall survival of vulnerable communities are at significant risk. Key gaps identified include the weak enforcement of urban planning regulations, limited community engagement, ineffective early warning systems, and poor intervention initiatives. This study suggests a multi-stakeholder approach that enhances both structural and non-structural flood resilience. Improving drainage systems, promoting sustainable waste management, improving climate adaptation policies, and fostering community-based flood mitigation strategies are crucial for achieving long-term urban resilience. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and climate resilience advocates working toward the Sustainable Development Agenda in Lagos metropolis.
