Abstract Rapid rubber plantations (RB) expansion in Southeast Asia raises critical questions about regional ecosystem stability. We compared stability between monoculture RB and diverse tropical rainforests (RF) using 37 years of satellite‐derived gross primary productivity across three metrics: long‐term temporal stability, resilience, and resistance to climate anomalies. Despite intensive management driving growth in RB, RF remained superior long‐term temporal stability and resilience, particularly at higher latitudes, likely reflecting their biodiversity and structural complexity. RB exhibited stronger resistance to temperature anomalies through intensive management but lower water resistance. Systematic trade‐offs emerged among stability dimensions, with environmental gradients modulating these differences, temperature amplified disparities while precipitation reduced them. These findings indicate that ongoing conversion of RF to RB threatens regional ecosystem stability, especially in marginal areas, underscoring the importance of forests conservation and sustainable plantation management.
