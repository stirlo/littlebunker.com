Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceAging-related reductions in motor coordination can lead to falls in the elderly, which increase morbidity and mortality. Despite this, the cerebellum, a brain region critically involved in motor coordination, has been little studied in aging. ...
