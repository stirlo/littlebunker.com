Nature Climate Change, Published online: 24 December 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02520-wEnergy transition minerals (ETM) are essential for decarbonization, yet extractions often occur in carbon-rich forests and lands of Indigenous peoples and local communities. Here the authors provide global analysis showing how ETM mining causes sustained forest loss and GHG emissions.
