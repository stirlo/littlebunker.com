Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 24, June 2025. SignificanceMunc13-1 is a master regulator of neurotransmitter release, which features a long low-complexity region in its N terminus. Here, we identified a functional motif in this region, termed polyE, which is unique to Munc13-1 among all Munc13 ...
