Nature Climate Change, Published online: 12 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02542-4The authors quantify long-term (2003–2024) changes in Northern Hemisphere mountain aspect asymmetry—the difference in vegetation density between polar-facing and equatorial-facing slopes. They show a weakening trend, linked to changing hydrothermal conditions.
