Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceType III secretion systems (T3SSs) are syringe-like machines that inject proteins into host cells in hierarchical fashion, yet how they enforce ordered substrate release has remained unclear. We show that inSalmonella, the SPI-1 T3SS protein ...
