Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 47, November 2025. SignificanceThis research examines chaotic behavior of magnetic field fluctuations within turbulent collisionless plasma, as observed by spacecraft in the geospace environment. A key challenge lies in disentangling spatial and temporal variations; ...
