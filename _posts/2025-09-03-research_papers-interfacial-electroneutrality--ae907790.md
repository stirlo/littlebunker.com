Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 35, September 2025. SignificanceThe selective transport of ionic species is essential for water treatment, resource recovery, and precision separations. This study demonstrates that the fractional coverage of charged domains on charge-patterned mosaic membranes (CMMs) can be ...
