THE HAGUE (February&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2026)&nbsp;—&nbsp;World Resources Institute congratulates Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice President of WRI and CEO of WRI Europe, on her nomination as Minister of Climate and Green Growth in the new Dutch government.Since&nbsp;joining&nbsp;WRI in&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;van Veldhoven&nbsp;has&nbsp;played&nbsp;a central role&nbsp;in shaping the Institute's work in Europe and globally. As&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;WRI Europe, she expanded the organization's mandate and footprint across the region and strengthened its work on climate action,&nbsp;nature&nbsp;and sustainable development.&nbsp;As WRI Vice President, she co-led the development of the Institute's global strategy, with a focus on supporting transitions in emerging economies. She also co-founded the Systems Transformation Hub, an initiative accelerating Europe's transition toward climate neutrality, competitiveness and strategic resilience.Prior to&nbsp;WRI,&nbsp;van Veldhoven served&nbsp;more than a decade&nbsp;in Dutch public office&nbsp;as a&nbsp;member of the&nbsp;D66&nbsp;party, including as Minister for the Environment and Housing, State Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Management&nbsp;and&nbsp;as a&nbsp;Member of Parliament. She also worked as an international diplomat in Brussels and with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and&nbsp;Development.“Stientje&nbsp;is a strategic&nbsp;and&nbsp;visionary leader&nbsp;who leaves WRI stronger, more resilient and more effective than when she joined, helping&nbsp;expand our impact across&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;and&nbsp;globally,” said&nbsp;Ani Dasgupta, President &amp; CEO, World Resources Institute.&nbsp;“Her deep commitment to climate action, nature protection and people's wellbeing&nbsp;is unwavering. We are grateful for her service and confident she will continue to lead with&nbsp;integrity&nbsp;and&nbsp;purpose in&nbsp;her new role serving the Netherlands&nbsp;as&nbsp;Minister of Climate and Green&nbsp;Growth.”
