Abstract Soil salinity and soil drought are primary global threats to cultivated land and crop productivity, yet their interrelationships and responses to a changing climate remain unclear. This study investigates the global distribution and long‐term trends of soil salinity, as well as its relationships with soil droughts from 1980 to 2018. Our findings reveal that 14.73% of global soils have experienced a significant increase in salinity. The increasing trend of soil salinity is closely linked to changes in soil drought patterns, particularly the increased total number of drought days. Critically, long‐term drought events (>6 months) play a key role in the transition from non‐saline to saline soil, setting the stage for the formation of saline soils in 6.78% of the world's dry regions. This study highlights a growing risk of soil salinization and provides critical insights for assessing soil vulnerability to degradation in the face of persistent droughts.
