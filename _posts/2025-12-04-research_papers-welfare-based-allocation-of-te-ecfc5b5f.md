Crop cultivation occupies substantial areas of land globally, contributing to biodiversity loss. In the context of globalization, the transnational flow of biodiversity loss footprints caused by international crop trade has raised questions about the allocation of ecological responsibility. However, most existing research tends to attribute such loss exclusively to either consumers or producers, which overlooks a more equitable perspective that integrates both parties’ responsibilities. By drawing upon welfare economics, this study allocates the biodiversity loss arising from crop trade between producers and consumers. We developed a high-resolution distribution map illustrating the allocation of export-induced biodiversity loss among consumers and producers. We also trace the origin of biodiversity loss allocated to consumers. These findings provide a basis for global ecological compensation initiatives and assist policymakers in optimizing land-use strategies.
