Abstract The stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) plays a crucial role in stratosphere‐troposphere coupling, particularly influencing Northern Hemisphere weather and climate. SPV position variations can drive significant climate shifts, including extreme weather. While SPV intensity and short‐term variability are well‐studied, the interdecadal variability and displacement remain poorly understood. We investigate the variations in vortex position and displacement periodicity, confirming its continuous shift toward Eurasia from the 1980s to the 2000s, followed by a reversal toward North America in the 2010s. Using ERA5 data set reveals that the SPV does not continuously shift in a single direction, but instead shows interdecadal oscillations with periodicity ranging from 10 to 20 years. These findings highlight that the decadal variation of polar vortex positions is non‐unidirectional and reveal the periodicity of its interdecadal variability.
