Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 20, May 2025. SignificanceProgrammable quantum simulators have become the modus optandi for clean and tunable realization of strongly correlated electron systems, with ultracold atom setups hosting a wealth of novel phases. Our work takes the decisive step of expanding ...
