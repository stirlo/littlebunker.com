Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 46, November 2025. SignificanceAngrites are the most volatile-depleted planetary materials known, yet the processes driving such extreme depletion remain uncertain. Using high-precision nickel isotope measurements, this study reveals that the angrite parent body (APB) ...
