MEXICO CITY (November 11, 2025) – Mexico has officially approved and presented its new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) at COP30. The plan marks a milestone in the country’s climate policy, introducing for the first time an absolute emissions cap for 2035 that covers all greenhouse gases and sectors of the economy.Reinforcing its contribution to the Paris Agreement’s objectives, Mexico has committed to reducing emissions to 364–404 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO₂e) unconditionally, and to 332–363 MtCO₂e with international support — a level the government estimates represents a reduction of more than 50% compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The NDC includes five interconnected components — mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, enabling conditions and means of implementation, and cross-cutting themes — that together outline a pathway for inclusive, low-carbon growth and resilient development.See the Spanish version.Below is a statement from Francisco Barnés Regueiro, Executive Director, World Resources Institute Mexico:“Mexico’s new climate plan stands among the most ambitious new climate targets from a major emitter, charting a path toward a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economy. It places people and nature at the heart of decision-making and reflects the government’s intent to align climate action with economic opportunity, jobs, social equity, and sustainable growth.\\"Mexico is aiming for deep emission cuts by 2035, in line with its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 – backed by an absolute target for greater transparency and accountability.“On adaptation, the plan strengthens actions across five strategic areas, from climate-resilient production systems and integrated water management to the protection of strategic infrastructure and cultural heritage. New components on loss and damage, as well as on climate and security, reflect the government’s focus on managing the social and economic risks of the climate crisis.“The NDC also embeds principles of gender equality, human rights, and intergenerational equity, ensuring that climate action addresses inequality, poverty, and vulnerability. It aims to deliver a just transition that creates decent jobs and broadens economic opportunity for women, Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, youth, and others historically left behind.“Mexico’s ambition is clear, but delivering on these goals will require deep structural transformation and a clear, sustained investment strategy that positions climate action as a driver of inclusive and sustainable growth. Success will depend on clear sectoral pathways, robust financing mechanisms, and strong implementation plans once the full NDC is released. Aligning public budgets, financial instruments, and subnational policies with this new climate plan will be critical to unlocking innovation, boosting competitiveness, and creating good-quality jobs in low-carbon sectors.”
