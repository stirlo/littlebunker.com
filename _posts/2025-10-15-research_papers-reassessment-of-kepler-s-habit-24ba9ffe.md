Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 41, October 2025. SignificanceWe propose a data-driven null signal template (NST) method to reliably estimate the statistical significance of exoplanet transit candidates in the presence of unknown sources of signal contamination. NST accounts for all possible systematics ...
