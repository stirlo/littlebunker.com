Abstract Data‐driven convective parameterization aims to accurately represent convective adjustments to large‐scale forcings in a computationally economic manner. While previous studies have demonstrated success using various model architectures, challenges persist in developing physically interpretable models and assessing generalizability and confidence levels. In this study, we develop a recurrent neural network to predict time series of temperature, moisture, and precipitation of a cumulus ensemble in response to large‐scale forcings. The recurrent cell combines a linear component, pre‐identified as a time‐invariant state‐space model within the linear limit of the problem, and a multilayer neural network for the nonlinear component. Trained on ensembles of limited‐domain cloud‐resolving model simulation data, the model exhibits stable and realistic performance in long‐term emulations, both with prescribed large‐scale forcings and when coupled with two‐dimensional gravity waves. We further calculate linear responses to perturbations for the coupled emulation, revealing physically interpretable, state‐dependent properties of the convectively coupled gravity wave system.
