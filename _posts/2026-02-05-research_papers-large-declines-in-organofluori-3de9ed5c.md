Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceDetrimental human and wildlife exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have prompted shifts in chemical manufacturing toward novel compounds that are difficult to detect. Here, we show that bulk organofluorine concentrations in ...
