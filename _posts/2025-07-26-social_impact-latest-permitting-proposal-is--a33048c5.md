Contact: kayla@unbendablemedia.com In response to the introduction of the SPEED Act today by Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director KD Chavez, issued the following statement. “This permitting bill is a wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing. It claims to speed up environmental review and infrastructure projects, but in reality, it speeds up disaster. It does nothing to ensure efficient environmental oversight and strips already-limited legal recourse from communities—especially those most impacted by pollution—to defend themselves against polluters and powerful industry interests. By narrowing what qualifies as a “major federal action” and weakening the requirement to study long-term or cumulative impacts, this bill strips away essential tools like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that Tribal Nations and frontline communities use to protect their lands, waters, cultural resources, and public health. And as if that weren&#8217;t enough, this so-called “bipartisan deal” blocks access to the courts and limits remedies for harmful federal decisions, further deepening environmental injustice and eroding trust. Tribal governments were not meaningfully consulted with, despite the bill’s direct threat to cultural resources and sacred sites; all for the sole purpose of expanding AI infrastructure, certain to accelerate climate chaos. This is a clear violation of tribal sovereignty and the federal trust responsibility. It’s time lawmakers listen to the people and put forward a permitting reform bill that safeguards communities, instead of sacrificing them. This kind of legislation has already been defeated numerous times, and for good reason. It&#8217;s time to stop beating this dead horse. Let’s call it what it is: another attempt to repeal NEPA, not a serious effort at permitting reform. If passed, this bill would accelerate a public health crisis and undermine treaty rights, rather than offer real, sustainable solutions. Our representatives should focus on building stronger public engagement tools, ensure progress towards climate resiliency, protect public lands and sacred sites, and invest in clean, community infrastructure that safeguards public health, not the profits of polluting industries.&#8221; ### The post Latest Permitting Proposal is a Wolf in Sheep&#8217;s Clothing appeared first on Climate Justice Alliance.
