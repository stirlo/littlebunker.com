Abstract Regularization of seismic inversions has a strong imprint on tomographic images. We analyze recorded and spectral‐element S, Sdiff, and SS waveforms to evaluate the benefit of body‐wave amplitudes in global tomography. L‐curve analysis for S40RTS models with recorded and synthetic waveforms show that SS‐S traveltimes and SS/S amplitude ratios have minima within the same damping parameter range. SS/S ratios for S40RTS and model GLAD‐M25 show the trade‐off between scale‐length and strength of lowermost‐mantle heterogeneities. The recorded SS/Sdiff ratios are lower than predicted by 3D mantle models which may be explained by a decrease in the mean shear velocity by ∼1% ${\\sim} 1\\%$ at the lowermost 200 km of the mantle. Our results suggest that SS/S amplitude measurements made with 3D waveforms can be used to constrain damping in linearized inversions, and amplitudes are essential for studying the size of heterogeneities.
