Nature Climate Change, Published online: 31 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02470-3Climate change influences not only crop yields but also crop nutritional content, which is currently not simulated by process-based crop models. This Perspective proposes a way forward to integrate nutrients into crop models to assess climate impacts and highlights data needs.
