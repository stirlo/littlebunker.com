Nature Climate Change, Published online: 19 September 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02437-4Sea-level rise poses a substantial risk to coastal communities and economies, thus accurate predictions are needed to enable planning and adaptation. This Perspective provides an overview of uncertainties in model projections of sea-level rise, and how observations can be used to reduce these.
