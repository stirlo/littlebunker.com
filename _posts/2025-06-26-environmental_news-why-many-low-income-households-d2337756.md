The federal Weatherization Assistance Program is the oldest and largest energy efficiency initiative in American history. Born from the 1973 oil crisis, it helps low- and moderate-income households make a litany of upgrades to their homes, such as installing insulation, sealing windows, and wrapping water pipes. The program, known as WAP, is often free and saves residents an average of $372 annually on their utility bills. But a report released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that many homes need basic — but expensive — repairs before they can participate, something many residents can’t afford. Those households are placed on a deferral list until those improvements are made. Although some buildings are too damaged to fix up and some people manage to get off the list, the research showed that, in 2023, another 7,000 homes could have been repaired but weren’t, due to lack of money. That’s a fifth of the 35,000 homes that the Department of Energy estimates WAP reaches each year. “We were the first to really figure out what the deferral rates are and why,” said Reuven Sussman, an expert in energy efficiency behavior change at ACEE and an author of the report. “I don’t think this problem is broadly known.”The Department of Energy, which administers the $326 million WAP budget, works with local companies to weatherize qualifying homes. ACEEE surveyed providers in 28 states about their deferrals. The top reason cited was the poor condition of the roof — an issue that undermines improvements such as attic insulation. Floor damage and outdated electric panels were the other leading justifications for deferring homes. The average cost of bringing a home up to WAP standards, the report found, was nearly $14,000.&nbsp; “If you&#8217;re eligible for WAP you likely don&#8217;t have enough money to pay for it,” Will Bryan, director of research for the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance. “There are households that are falling through the cracks.” Read Next FEMA moves to end one of its biggest disaster adaptation programs Zoya Teirstein &#038; Jake Bittle People facing deferrals have a few options, but they are limited and inconsistent. Depending on where these residents live, some public, private, or philanthropic funds are available for critical home repairs. Some states — like Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Vermont — have more specific programs targeting WAP deferrals. Starting in 2022, the federal government also provided money for the Weatherization Readiness Fund, or WRF, though it only backed it with about $15 million. “The government has experimented with some pre-weathization funding, but that hasn&#8217;t happened at the kind of scale that it needs to,” said Bryan. And, he added, President Donald J. Trump’s administration and Congress are trying to pull what little money has become available in recent years. The “big beautiful” budget bill that the House recently passed zeros out the budget for both WAP and WRF, as well as related assistance or incentive programs. The impacts of the rollback could be drastic. “Elderly people, disabled people, small children — their energy burden is so much higher than other folks because they are on fixed incomes,” said Bryan Burris, vice president of energy conservation programs at projectHOMES, a WAP provider in Richmond, Virginia. The recent influx of state and federal funding has helped his organization cut its deferral rate from around 50 percent to about 20, but that progress is in peril. “People are in really bad situations,” said Burris. “There is a very big demand for this no-cost program.” Counselors help people to apply for storm preparation financial assistance through the Weatherization Assistance Program at the Carl Walker, Jr. Multi-purpose Center in Houston.

If all those homes were able to receive WAP services, it would save 49,236 megawatt-hours of energy annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 153,000 metric tons over the lifetime of the measures. WAP projects also often pay for themselves many times over in lower utility bills. Evaluating the effectiveness of weatherization readiness programs is more complex. Although they may save homeowners some money on a monthly basis, the greatest gains of major repairs are often indirect boosts in health and quality of life. For example, fixing a roof could help a senior citizen age in place, rather than go to an assisted living facility. Removing toxic substances, like asbestos, from homes could prevent illnesses in children. “You can potentially save money in the long term by reducing the hazards that people are exposed to,” said Bryan, pointing to a substantial body of research supporting the idea. A 2021 study in the southeastern United States, for example, found that after weatherization, “respondents reported fewer bad days of physical and mental health. Households were better able to pay their energy bills and afford prescriptions.” While that line of inquiry was beyond the scope of the latest ACEEE report, Sussman said the logic makes sense. Avoiding even a minor trip to the hospital or doctor could save programs like Medicaid or Medicare thousands of dollars. “People live with holes in the roof and asbestos and can&#8217;t get assistance,”&nbsp; said Bryan. “It leads to health issues.” This story was originally published by Grist with the headline Why many low-income households can&#8217;t afford this free home improvement program on Jun 26, 2025.
