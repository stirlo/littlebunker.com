Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceReconstructing the evolution of ancient landscapes is essential for understanding how Earth’s surface responds to tectonics, climate, sea-level change, and the biosphere. Cosmogenic nuclide analysis determines how long minerals have resided at ...
