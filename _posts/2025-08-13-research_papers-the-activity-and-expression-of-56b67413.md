Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 32, August 2025. SignificanceAn amino acid substitution and noncoding changes have reduced adenylosuccinate lyase activity in modern humans after the divergence from Neandertals and Denisovans. This resulted in increased concentrations of purine substrates of the enzyme, ...
