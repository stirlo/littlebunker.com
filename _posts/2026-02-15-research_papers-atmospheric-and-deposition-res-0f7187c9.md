Abstract 10Be deposition in ice cores is widely used for solar reconstructions, but its interpretation is complicated by volcanic influences. Using the state‐of‐the‐art aerosol‐climate model ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3‐SALSA2.0: 10Be, we assess the impacts of three major volcanic eruptions: Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo (1991). All eruptions enhance stratospheric 10Be sedimentation, increasing atmospheric 10Be below the injection altitude for several months, followed by stratospheric 10Be depletion that takes years to recover. Increases in tropospheric 10Be and deposition coincide with periods of strong stratosphere–troposphere exchange. Aerosol‐induced sedimentation significantly enhances polar 10Be deposition subsequent to the Pinatubo and El Chichón eruptions but plays a limited role after the Agung eruption. Sensitivity experiments reveal that higher SO2 injections generally lead to nonlinear increases in global 10Be deposition. These results underscore the need to account for volcanic influences when interpreting and modeling polar 10Be records following major eruptions.
