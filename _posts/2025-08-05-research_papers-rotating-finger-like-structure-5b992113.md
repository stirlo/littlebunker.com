Abstract At Jupiter, the plasma is concentrated near the centrifugal equator, forming a magnetodisc. The planet's dipole tilt induces periodic disc flapping, generating magnetic oscillations observed by spacecraft. While centrifugal forces are theorized to drive interchange instability in this system, direct detection of such structures remains challenging due to flapping‐induced variabilities. However, in situ and remote sensing data reveal ∼tens‐of‐minute periodicities proposed to link to interchange dynamics. Using unique Juno observations, we analyze two events to: (a) resolve highly variable magnetic curvature changes during successive plasma sheet crossings and (b) identify periodic ∼30‐min fluctuations in plasma measurements in the magnetodisc while Juno occupied a magnetically favorable location. These findings provide the first direct examination of interchange‐related magnetic curvature evolution and plasma signatures, to advance our understanding of the magnetodisc's 3D structure and instability‐driven dynamics.
