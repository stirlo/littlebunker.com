Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceThe Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism. Our multitaxon analysis shows that the endemic flora of the QTP had emerged by the Early Eocene. Both long-term in situ speciation and immigration have been responsible ...
