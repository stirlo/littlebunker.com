Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceMetabolic reprogramming is a notable phenotype during the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Thus, reverting metabolism can be an effective strategy to sensitize drug-resistant cells. The computational framework developed in this ...
