Abstract Perennial firn aquifers in the Greenland ice sheet are known to form and persist in regions of sufficiently high melt rates and accumulation rates throughout the year. However, it is not clear how seasonal to sub‐seasonal variations in surface melt forcings affect the dynamics of melt recharge into a firn aquifer and the accompanying refreezing processes. Here, we use a hydrological model to probe how different styles of seasonal melting influence the recharge of a firn aquifer and the structural changes of the unsaturated firn column above. We find that a simple subsurface energy balance can provide a good estimation for melt partitioning, however our results suggest that the early dynamics of the melt season dictates the timing of recharge. Further, we show that an increased magnitude of melt in a single season leads to deeper refreezing, and that seasons with intermittent melt events can create ice lenses at depth.
