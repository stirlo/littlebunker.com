Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceThe spatial and temporal relationships between sequential metabolic enzymes in a pathway have revealed how metabolon formation contributes to metabolic control. This study uses fluorescence microscopy to better understand the factors that ...
