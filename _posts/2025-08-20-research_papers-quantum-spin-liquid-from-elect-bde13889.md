Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 33, August 2025. SignificanceThe search for quantum spin liquids—an exotic phase of matter that features fractionalization and topological order—has primarily focused on frustrated antiferromagnets. In this work, we reveal an alternative route to its physical realization ...
