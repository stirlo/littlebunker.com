Groups say EPA’s rollback threatens transparency and community right-to-know. Contact: kayla@unbendablemedia.com Washington, D.C. — Today, Climate Justice Alliance, GreenLatinos, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice, together with more than 140 partner organizations, primarily Environmental Justice and Tribal organizations, submitted formal comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to repeal and suspend the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and its Subpart W requirements for the oil and gas sector. This proposal follows the agency’s ongoing efforts to roll back critical climate protections, including the landmark Endangerment Finding and other key climate regulations. Together, these actions mark a dangerous reversal of decades of progress toward environmental accountability and climate justice. Established in 2009 under congressional direction, the GHGRP provides the only publicly available, facility-level data tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across nearly every sector of the U.S. economy. Federal and state agencies, including the Department of Energy and the Department of the Treasury, rely on this data to implement climate programs, allocate clean-energy investments, and evaluate progress toward emissions goals. Repealing the program, particularly Subpart W, which tracks methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, would critically weaken oversight and transparency. Without it, regulators and residents would lose access to reliable information essential to protecting their air, health, and climate. “Eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program doesn’t reduce burdens, it conceals harm,” said Meisei Gonzalez, Climate Justice &amp; Clean Air Program Manager at GreenLatinos. “Our communities depend on transparent data to expose pollution, demand accountability, and push for clean air and a livable climate. The EPA’s proposal puts industry profits ahead of public health and truth.” Communities of color, Indigenous peoples, and low-income residents already live disproportionately near oil and gas operations and face higher rates of asthma, cancer, and cardiovascular disease due to methane and co-pollutant exposure. Without transparent data, these same communities will be left in the dark, unable to track or respond to the pollution that impacts their health and environment. “While the Trump administration dismantles pollution tracking and Congress bends to polluters, the last thing we need is weaker oversight. Families deserve accurate data, not blind spots, when it comes to the air we breathe and the climate we depend on,” said Climate Justice Alliance legislative director Mar Zepeda Salazar. The coalition’s comment letter urges the EPA to withdraw the proposal immediately and reaffirm its duty to protect human health and the environment through transparency, science, and justice. “Nearly half of Americans, including almost 60% of people of color, face failing air quality. Adding to this, intensifying climate‑driven extreme weather disproportionately impacts environmental justice communities hardest. Given the stakes, it is inexcusable that the Trump Administration’s EPA is providing cover for industries to dodge accountability for their polluting emissions. Access to GHG data is critical as it empowers our communities to fight for the clean air and healthy environment we deserve,” said Yosef Robele, Federal Policy Manager at WE ACT for Environmental Justice Read the full Environmental Justice, Tribal, and Allied Organizations’ Comment Letter here ### Climate Justice Alliance is a growing member-based organization of nearly 100 urban and rural frontline and Indigenous communities, organizations, and supporting networks working to build a Just Transition away from the extractive economy and toward a more regenerative one.
