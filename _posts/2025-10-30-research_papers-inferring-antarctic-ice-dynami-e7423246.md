Abstract In their study, Young et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL115729) employ airborne radio‐echo sounding data to map the basal unit over the East Antarctic Ice Sheet over a large area between Dome A and South Pole. The authors use the results to infer conclusions about ice‐dynamic behavior of the ice sheet, geology, temporal development of subglacial geomorphology and physical properties of ice and the subsurface in this region. A comparative study has not been performed before. The results are of relevance for a number of disciplines and objectives, among them the quest for finding an ice‐core site to yield a record older than 1 million years, constraining the basal boundary conditions for ice‐flow modeling as well as determining subglacial geology to improve geothermal heat flow estimates.
