Abstract Mooring observations in the Halmahera Sea during September 2018 through October 2020 show a mean transport of 0.37–0.76 Sv through the Gebe Strait into the Indonesian seas. This estimate, together with mooring measurements in the Makassar Strait, the Maluku Channel, and the Jailolo Strait of the Halmahera Sea, suggests the total mean transport of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) to be 16.8 Sv ± 1.0 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1), larger than the 15 Sv mean transport previously measured at the exit straits. Mooring data in the Maluku and Halmahera Seas, combined with Lagrangian tracking of the Makassar Strait throughflow using reanalysis velocity, show that 40% of the total ITF transport comes directly from the South Pacific Ocean. The above findings have revised the traditional concept that the ITF comes mainly from the North Pacific. One Sentence Summary The direct South Pacific to Indian Ocean transfer into the Great Ocean Conveyor is revealed.
