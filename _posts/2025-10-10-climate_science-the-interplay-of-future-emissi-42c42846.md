Nature Climate Change, Published online: 10 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02457-0Unclear emissions and ice-sheet processes drive uncertainties in future sea-level rise. The authors show that the timing of emissions reductions drives the uncertainties during the twenty-first century, but geophysical uncertainties become more important with time, especially under optimistic scenarios.
