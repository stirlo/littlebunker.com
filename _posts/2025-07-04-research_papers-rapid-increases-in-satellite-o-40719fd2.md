Nature Climate Change, Published online: 04 July 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02364-4Surface melt is an important component of ice sheet dynamics, but for many remote regions the melt rates are mainly known from models. Here the authors present satellite observations of melt rates for Greenland and Antarctica, showing that East Antarctica has become a melting hotspot.
