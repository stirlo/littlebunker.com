Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceSulfur biomolecules, such as the amino acids cysteine and methionine, are ubiquitous in all modern organisms. However, few prebiotic chemistry studies have demonstrated the abiotic production of organosulfur biomolecules. This fact coupled ...
