Moose (Alces alces) are a cold-adapted species that may be vulnerable to overheating at relatively low temperatures in winter. Moose have two main strategies for thermal regulation: shifting activity patterns and selecting habitat that provides thermal refuge. In this study, we compared how moose use these two strategies in response to winter temperature across their latitudinal range. First, we used hidden Markov models to delineate encamped and traveling movement states for five populations of global positioning system-collared moose in relation to time of day, temperature, and snow depth. Next, we used step-selection functions to determine influential covariates of encamped locations. As air temperatures and snow depths increased, moose from all populations were more likely to remain in an encamped, relatively stationary state. All moose became less diurnal and more nocturnal at high temperatures, although the magnitude of changes in activity varied by population. Encamped northern moose selected shrubby habitat that presents foraging opportunities, whereas encamped southern moose selected for coniferous forest that provides poor forage but offers shade in southern regions. The only moose population to select for lower temperatures also experienced the warmest winter on record during our study period, which may explain this population’s low overall activity rates. Our results indicate that moose along their southern range extent are responding to elevated mid-winter temperatures by initially altering activity patterns and subsequently selecting for potential thermal refugia at the expense of foraging habitat, while northern moose were unlikely to shift habitat selection based on temperature unless faced with an anomalously warm winter. As climate change is implicated in range contraction and population declines, our findings suggest that high winter temperatures may be causing moose to not only reduce overall activity but also to forgo preferred foraging habitat in favor of prioritizing thermal refuge, thus forcing a trade-off between nutrition and thermoregulation.
