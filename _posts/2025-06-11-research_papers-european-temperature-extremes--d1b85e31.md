Abstract Recent simulations using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) indicate that a tipping event of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) would cause Europe to cool by several degrees. This AMOC tipping event was found under constant pre‐industrial greenhouse gas forcing, while global warming likely limits this AMOC‐induced cooling response. Here, we quantify the European temperature responses under different AMOC regimes and climate change scenarios. A strongly reduced AMOC state and intermediate global warming (≤+2° ${\le} +2{}^{\circ}$C, Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) has a profound cooling effect on Northwestern Europe with more intense cold extremes. The largest temperature responses are found during the winter months and these responses are strongly influenced by the North Atlantic sea‐ice extent. Enhanced North Atlantic storm track activity under an AMOC collapse results in substantially larger day‐to‐day temperature fluctuations. We conclude that the (far) future European temperatures are dependent on both the AMOC strength and the emission scenario.
