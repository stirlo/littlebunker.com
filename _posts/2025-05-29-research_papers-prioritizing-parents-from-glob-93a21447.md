Nature Climate Change, Published online: 29 May 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02333-xThe authors consider the future climate resilience and genomic adaptive capacity of the globally important crop sorghum using 1,937 global accessions. They identify the best potential parents and geographies for crop improvements, and underscore the need for better accessibility of plant resources.
