Abstract Deep convective clouds regulate Earth's energy and moisture budgets, yet their impact on the atmospheric boundary layer (BL) composition remains underexplored. Using long‐term observations from three mid‐latitude sites, we show that deep convection (DC) consistently enhances nighttime surface ozone and is often accompanied by modest increases in ultrafine particle concentrations. Within the BL, the condensational growth of these transported ultrafine particles may contribute up to 60% of total cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Mass flux calculations suggest that short‐lived convective cores (∼30 min) account for ∼2% of total vertical air mass transport relative to steady entrainment, increasing to ∼13% when the trailing stratiform regions are included. These results show that DC provides an episodic but efficient pathway linking the free troposphere and BL, influencing oxidant budgets, CCN variability, and climate forcing. Accurately representing this process in climate models may help reduce uncertainties in climate projections, under both preindustrial and present‐day conditions.
