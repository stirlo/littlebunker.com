Abstract Eurasian summer precipitation variability plays a critical role in regional climate systems, profoundly impacting ecosystems and socioeconomic development. While existing research has demonstrated the simultaneous link between the North Atlantic tripole (NAT) and precipitation anomalies in Eurasia, the underlying mechanisms connecting boreal winter NAT to subsequent summer precipitation anomalies remain unclear. This study reveals that the boreal winter NAT, persisting into summer, significantly affects Eurasian summer precipitation. It demonstrates that diabatic heating anomalies contribute ∼29% to the teleconnection wave train, while transient eddy vorticity forcing accounts for ∼25%. The wave train propagates downstream, causing circulation and precipitation anomalies over Eurasia. Model simulations confirm this physical mechanism and the potential of winter NAT as a valuable predictor for Eurasian summer precipitation. These findings enhance our understanding of cross‐seasonal climate linkages and have significant implications for enhancing seasonal forecasting capabilities.
