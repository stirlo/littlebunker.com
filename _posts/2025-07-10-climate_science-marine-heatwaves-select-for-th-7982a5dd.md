Nature Climate Change, Published online: 10 July 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02381-3The authors evaluate heritable genetic variation in thermal tolerance in a common reef-building coral. They show widespread heritable genetic variation, which is strongly associated with marine heatwave-imposed selective pressure, suggesting adaptation to climate warming.
