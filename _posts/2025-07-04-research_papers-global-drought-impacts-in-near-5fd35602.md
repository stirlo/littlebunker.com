Drought impact monitoring is often limited by data availability in terms of both access to impact information and the effectiveness of data acquisition. These challenges have been partially addressed by employing the drought impact information accessed via text data (newspaper articles or online social network content). While this approach provides valuable insights, it remains constrained by temporal relevance, as data preparation is often retrospective and time-consuming. In this study, we introduce the Global Drought Impact Report Database, a system for the weekly collection and classification of drought impact data from online media sources, designed to support near-real-time monitoring. The database includes over 9400 drought impact reports from 152 countries. The database is updated weekly, and the results are publicly available at a pilot database content viewer. The database can serve as a complementary source for drought monitoring, early impact detection, and global impact analysis, and may support further assessment of drought monitoring systems.
