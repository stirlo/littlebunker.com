Nature Climate Change, Published online: 23 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02464-1The authors obtained large-volume individuals of diatom cultures under thermal stress. These polyploids (having more than two sets of chromosomes) are shown to rapidly adapt to high temperatures, highlighting polyploidization as a possible adaptive measure for diatoms under climate change.
