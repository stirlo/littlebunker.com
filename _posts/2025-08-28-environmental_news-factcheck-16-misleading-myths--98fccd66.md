Solar power is already providing the “cheapest electricity in history” and is expected to play a pivotal role in the global transition away from fossil fuels. The technology accounted for two-thirds of the world’s new electricity capacity and two-fifths of new generation in 2024, according to the thinktank Ember.&nbsp; Yet, this rapid expansion has triggered a backlash, with numerous campaigns springing up to oppose new solar projects from the UK to Australia. These groups frequently draw on misinformation, spread by right-leaning media outlets, anti-renewable energy groups and predominantly right-wing political parties. Increasingly, these narratives are having real-world consequences, with governments restricting or even banning the installation of solar panels across swathes of land. Here, Carbon Brief factchecks 16 of the most common myths about solar power. The post Factcheck: 16 misleading myths about solar power appeared first on Carbon Brief.
