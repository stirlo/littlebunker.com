Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 25, June 2025. SignificanceGonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) is crucial for reproductive health and a therapeutic target for disorders like endometriosis, prostate cancer, and infertility. This study employs cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to unravel ...
