Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceThe net carbon uptake of North American temperate forests offsets ~20% of the continentâ€™s annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, this carbon sink is vulnerable to climate change effects, including warmer growing seasons and less ...
