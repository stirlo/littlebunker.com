A century-old mystery of a stubborn cold patch in the North Atlantic is finally being unraveled. A new study links this anomaly to a long-term weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) a massive ocean current system that regulates climate across the Northern Hemisphere. Using over 100 years of temperature and salinity data, researchers showed that only models with a weakening AMOC could recreate the observed changes. The implications are vast, influencing everything from European weather to marine ecosystems, and casting doubt on many recent climate models that underestimated this oceanic shift.
