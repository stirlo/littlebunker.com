Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceOngoing work in functional annotations of genomes has generated rich datasets. We propose a method to link extensive functional annotations to genotype-to-phenotype associations. This method ranks annotation categories based on their ...
