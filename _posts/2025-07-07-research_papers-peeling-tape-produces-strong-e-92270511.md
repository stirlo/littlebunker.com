Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceVisible light emitted when rapidly peeling tape is a striking demonstration of tribocharging and triboluminescence. Remarkably, the peeling interface can generate electric fields as high as 109V/m, a field strength rarely achieved using ...
