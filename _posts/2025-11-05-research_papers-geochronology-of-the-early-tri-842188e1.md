Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 44, November 2025. SignificanceTo investigate the coevolution of life and environment in deep time, a robust time framework is essential. Here, we establish a high-resolution age model for the Early Triassic—a critical time interval following the Permian-Triassic mass ...
