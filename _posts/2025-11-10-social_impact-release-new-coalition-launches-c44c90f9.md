Launched by the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition and partners, the initiative will help companies scale clean energy solutions, decarbonize sectors and generate green jobs across the region.(Belém, BRASIL) November 11, 2025 — At COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition – in partnership with Global Renewables Alliance (GRA), Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and Climate Group’s RE100 initiative – today launched the Latin America Clean Energy Coalition (LACEC), a major initiative to rapidly scale corporate clean energy adoption and accelerate Latin America's transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.The coalition brings together leading companies, energy developers, financiers, civil society and policymakers to unlock investment, accelerate breakthrough solutions and advance policies that make clean energy more affordable, accessible and scalable across the region. Together, these efforts will help Latin America move closer to reaching its goal of tripling renewables by 2030. Nike is the founding member. &nbsp;“Latin America has all the ingredients to lead the global energy transition,” said Fernando Páez, Executive Director of WRI Colombia, “With over 60% of the region's electricity already from clean sources and more than 2 million renewable energy jobs created in 2023, the foundation is strong – but much more must be done. LACEC will mobilize the private sector to turn that potential into action – helping industries decarbonize, strengthen competitiveness, and spark new job growth.”Despite this potential, the region faces persistent challenges that slow the adoption of clean energy. Current national plans and targets are projected to deliver only half of the annual growth in renewable power needed to stay on track. Key obstacles include an energy mix overly reliant on hydropower, weak grid infrastructure, and limited cross-border interconnections – gaps that LACEC aims to address.“Latin America’s clean energy potential is immense, but realizing it takes more than ambition – it takes action,” said Trigya Singh, Senior Manager Corporate Sourcing, Global Renewables Alliance. “Through LACEC, we're helping energy buyers, sellers and policymakers involved in sourcing renewable energy, access renewable power more easily, clearing regulatory roadblocks, and sparking a wave of clean energy projects. These projects will help boost energy security, drive sustainable growth and transform Latin America.”Building on the successful Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) model, which catalyzed corporate renewable energy adoption across Asian markets, LACEC will serve as Latin America's hub for clean energy leadership and knowledge exchange. The coalition will help companies design and implement robust renewable energy strategies, work with governments to drive enabling policies, and coordinate finance and investment to rapidly scale clean energy projects across industrial and manufacturing sectors.“Success in Latin America's renewable energy transition won't come from technology alone – it needs effective collaboration and strong governance,” said María Teresa Ruiz-Tagle, Executive Director, Corporate Leaders Group for Climate Action – Chile (CLG Chile). “The region needs a clear roadmap built on public-private-civil collaboration, with smarter storage, streamlined regulations and electrifying key sectors. We're convinced LACEC can help turn these priorities into real progress across Latin America.”LACEC will launch its work in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, with plans to expand soon to Chile and Argentina. The coalition builds on WRI's deep regional presence and proven expertise in advancing evidence-based solutions for the global energy transition, together with the industry leadership of GRA, GWEC, and RE100. Further expansion across Latin America is planned for later phases, with a full list of partners to be announced in early 2026.“This is a crucial moment for Mexico, as energy demand grows and momentum builds behind renewable energy development,” said Francisco Urbano Barnés Regueiro, Executive Director, WRI Mexico. “LACEC is uniquely positioned to help strengthen infrastructure, align policies, and improve energy distribution and storage. We are proud to join this collective effort and contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive energy future for Mexico and the wider Latin America region.”&nbsp;Companies interested in joining LACEC or learning more about the coalition can contact Diego Merizalde, Program Lead for the Latin America Clean Energy Coalition, info@latamcleanenergycoalition.com. &nbsp;About the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy TransitionThe WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition harnesses analytical power, convening ability and global expertise to help orchestrate the transition to a clean, abundant and reliable energy future by delivering evidence-based, pragmatic and scalable solutions. The nonpartisan WRI Polsky Energy Center seeks to overcome critical barriers to modernizing and expanding energy grids, scaling financing and deployment, sourcing critical minerals responsibly and building a skilled, future-ready workforce. &nbsp;About the Global Wind Energy CouncilThe Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) is the international trade association for the wind power industry. Its mission is to ensure that wind power establishes itself as the answer to today’s energy challenges, providing substantial environmental and economic benefits. GWEC is a member-based organisation that represents the entire wind energy sector. Members of GWEC represent over 1,500 companies, organisations and institutions in more than 80 countries.About the Global Renewables AllianceThe Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) is a partnership formed by leading associations representing wind power (Global Wind Energy Council), solar power (Global Solar Council), hydropower (International Hydropower Association), green hydrogen (Green Hydrogen Organisation), long-duration energy storage (LDES Council) and geothermal energy (International Geothermal Association) that focuses on overcoming challenges to the global transition to a sustainable energy future.About RE100RE100 is a global initiative bringing together the world’s most influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. Led by Climate Group, our mission is to drive change towards 100% renewable grids, both through the direct investments of our members, and by working with policymakers to accelerate the transition to a clean economy. RE100 was established in partnership with CDP. The initiative has over 400 members, ranging from household brands to critical infrastructure and heavy industry suppliers.
