Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 44, November 2025. SignificanceSerial recall is a key behavior in episodic memory, utilizing processes such as item context binding and sequence generation. Sharp-wave ripples play a crucial role in episodic memory by facilitating the replay of encoded events. A prominent ...
