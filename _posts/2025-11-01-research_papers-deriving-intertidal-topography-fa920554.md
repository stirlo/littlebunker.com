Abstract The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, initially designed to observe oceans and inland waters, proves valuable for mapping intertidal flat topography. This study presents a fusion method that integrates freely available SWOT interferometric altimetry data with Sentinel‐2 imagery. The density‐based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm is employed to accurately identify observation data located in the intertidal zone. Intertidal topography with a 10 m resolution were generated from L2_HR_PIXC data collected during SWOT's science phase (July 2023–October 2024) in the intertidal region along the coast of Jiangsu Province, China. These Digital Elevation Models were compared with laser altimetry observations from the ICESat‐2. SWOT observations show high accuracy, with RMSEs of 0.24 m (multi‐cycle) and 0.41 m (single‐cycle), confirming their potential for intertidal monitoring. This study presents a data processing strategy that does not rely on ground‐based observations, demonstrating potential for application in a broader range of regions.
