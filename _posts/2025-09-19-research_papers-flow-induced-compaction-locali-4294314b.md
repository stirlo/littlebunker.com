Abstract Fluid injection into underground rocks plays a crucial role in various geoengineering applications. While injection‐induced deformation is often associated with tensile and shear failures, the feasibility of flow‐driven compaction localization remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the formation of compaction localizations in a rock‐like porous medium composed of sintered polymethyl methacrylate beads, using high‐resolution image analysis. By tracking deformation in real‐time, we reveal a complex localization process that couples compaction with shear. Moreover, following the initial localization, we observe a transient loss and subsequent recovery of stiffness within the medium. These findings suggest that flow‐induced compaction localizations likely play a significant role in field‐scale deformation processes, particularly in high‐porosity rock formations subjected to pressurized flow.
