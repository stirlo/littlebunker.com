Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceThe Lomagundi–Jatuli Event (LJE), more than 2 billion years ago, marks a major shift in Earth’s carbon cycle, following the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Its cause, however, remains unresolved. We dated black shales from Gabon to 2.194 billion ...
