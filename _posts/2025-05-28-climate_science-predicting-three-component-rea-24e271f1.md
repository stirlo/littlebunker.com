Abstract Efficient drug discovery depends on reliable synthetic access to candidate molecules, but emerging machine learning approaches to predicting reaction outcomes are hampered by poor availability of high-quality data. Here, we demonstrate an on-demand synthesis platform based on a three-component reaction that delivers drug-like molecules. Miniaturization and automation enable the execution and analysis of 50,000 distinct reactions on a 3-microliter scale from 193 different substrates, producing the largest public reaction outcome dataset. With machine learning, we accurately predict the result of unknown reactions and analyze the impact of dataset size on model training, both enabling accurate outcome predictions even for unseen reactants and providing a sufficiently large dataset to critically evaluate emerging machine learning approaches to chemical reactivity.
