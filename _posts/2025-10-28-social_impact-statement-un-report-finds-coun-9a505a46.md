WASHINGTON, DC (October 28, 2025) — The UNFCCC released its NDC Synthesis Report today, reviewing climate plans from 64 countries, covering roughly 30% of global emissions. The report aggregates submitted plans and their projected emissions reductions, finding that current pledges would reduce emissions by about 17% from their 2019 levels, far short of what’s needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. The analysis reflects submissions received up until September 30, 2025.Countries representing 64% of global emissions still have not formally submitted new NDCs and are not included in this analysis.Following is a statement from Melanie Robinson, Global Climate, Economics and Finance Program Director, World Resources Institute:&nbsp;“This report lays bare a frightening gap between what governments have promised and what is needed to protect people and planet. While the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway, it’s clear that countries need to shift from a jog to an all-out sprint. &nbsp;\\"Some countries have recognized the economic gains to be made by being among the front-runners in the global energy transition. But too many nations are lagging behind, failing to see that climate action costs less than dealing with climate impacts – and that investing in the new economy is a catalyst for growth, driving jobs, prosperity and security.\\"The UN analysis shows national climate plans are starting to bend global emissions downward: 2035 targets would lower emissions by about 6% compared with previous 2030 NDC targets, and emissions would peak by 2030 if those NDCs are implemented. But that progress is dwarfed by the vast gap still needed to avoid breaching the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. &nbsp;“The report paints an incomplete picture because countries representing nearly two-thirds of global emissions either missed the September cut-off for inclusion or have not yet submitted new plans. Those still on the hook to submit must deliver ambitious climate targets if they want to stay competitive, attract investment and benefit their workforce. &nbsp;“Encouragingly, the analysis points out examples of real momentum, with more countries scaling renewable energy, decarbonizing transport and integrating adaptation and just transition into their plans. These are promising developments both countries and cities can seize upon, replicate and scale.“Leaders should treat this report not as a warning but as a rallying cry. COP30 must deliver a practical plan to accelerate action this decade - because every fraction of a degree avoided means lives saved, more abundant food and water, better livelihoods, and stronger economies.”&nbsp;
