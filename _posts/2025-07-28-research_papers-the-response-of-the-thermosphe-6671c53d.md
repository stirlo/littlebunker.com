Abstract This study investigates thermospheric response to the 2019 solar eclipse, focusing on temperature and neutral mass density variations at Wuhan and Beijing. The method proposed by Li et al. (2023, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022ja030988) to derive thermospheric parameters from electron density profiles was employed. Results revealed a significant temperature decrease at both locations. At Wuhan, the exospheric temperature (Tex) dropped by up to 50 K, with maximum decrease occurring approximately 45 min after peak obscuration. Similarly, at Beijing, Tex decreased by a maximum of 30 K, also peaking around 45 min after maximum obscuration. Using an energy balance model, the estimated Tex reduction explained the time lag between maximum obscuration and minimum Tex. Changes in neutral mass density exhibited altitude dependence, but followed a similar temporal trend to temperature changes. These findings highlight the significant impact of solar eclipses on the thermosphere and emphasize the importance of considering various influencing factors in future research.
