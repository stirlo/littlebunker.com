Abstract Narrow bipolar events (NBEs) are produced by large‐scale systems of streamer corona discharges that occur inside thunderstorms and radiate intensely at very‐high frequencies. Here we examine 14 high‐power NBEs recorded in Florida which are followed by a lasting oscillatory signal. We isolate the dominant frequencies of the oscillations using empirical mode decomposition methods, and cross‐reference this information with the radiator size inferred from broadband interferometry. We conclude that the oscillations are evidence of a standing electromagnetic wave in the plasma cavity created by the preceding streamer system, that is, the cavity's fundamental mode with wavelength equal to twice the radiator length. Contrasting the dispersive and attenuation properties of these waves across several different events allows us to conclude that the cavity is filled with ions resulting in an average conductivity of 0.01–0.1 mS/m, which are left behind after the streamers decay via electron attachment to oxygen molecules.
