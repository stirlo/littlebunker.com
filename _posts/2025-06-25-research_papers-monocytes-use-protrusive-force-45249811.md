Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 25, June 2025. SignificanceCell migration is essential for numerous biological processes in health and disease, including for immune cell trafficking. Monocyte immune cells migrate through extracellular matrix (ECM) to the tumor microenvironment where they can play a ...
