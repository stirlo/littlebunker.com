Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceCompetitive interactions shape key metabolic processes in microbial communities. As a model to study these interactions, we examine microbes that degrade chitin—one of the most prevalent polysaccharides in nature. Our findings demonstrate that ...
