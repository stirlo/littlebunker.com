Abstract Aerosol plumes emitted from ships can cause brightening of low clouds. The aerosol plume spreading rate controls what fraction of the cloud may experience brightening. Developing a deeper physical understanding of the mechanisms driving variations in spreading rate could inform the development of plume‐spreading parameterizations in global climate models, which may be relevant for assessing the feasibility of Marine Cloud Brightening. In this study, we employ large‐eddy simulations of two idealized precipitating stratocumulus cases to investigate the roles of collision‐coalescence, cloud droplet sedimentation, and droplet effective radius in the ship track and quantify their individual and combined effects on plume buoyancy anomalies and spreading rates. Our results indicate that cloud droplet sedimentation and collision‐coalescence are the primary mechanisms controlling buoyancy and horizontal spreading, whereas the influence of effective radius is negligible. Sensitivity tests indicate that mesoscale circulations can develop within the ship track even in the absence of precipitation suppression.
