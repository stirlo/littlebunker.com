Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceWe report systematic characterization of bridging forces stabilizing protein-DNA condensates. These forces are fundamental to our understanding of the physical basis of biomolecular condensates. Moreover, they are of direct biological ...
