Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 33, August 2025. SignificancePaleoclimate is closely linked to atmosphericpCO2. Quantifying ancient CO2levels, however, is challenging. Air-breathing vertebrates respire air O2and incorporate its isotope signature via body water into their hard tissues. Fossil tooth ...
