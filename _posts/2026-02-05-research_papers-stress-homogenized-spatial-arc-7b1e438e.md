Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceThe growing global demand for lithium necessitates more efficient and sustainable selective electrodes for electrochemical extraction from salt lakes. Spinel-type LiMn2O4is highly promising, but its poor cycling performance is intrinsically ...
