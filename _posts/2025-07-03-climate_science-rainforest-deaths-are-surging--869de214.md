Tropical trees are dying faster than ever, and it's not just heat or drought to blame. Scientists have uncovered a surprising culprit: ordinary thunderstorms. These quick, fierce storms, powered by climate change, are toppling trees with intense winds and lightning, sometimes causing more damage than drought itself. The discovery is reshaping how we understand rainforest health and carbon storage, as storms may be responsible for up to 60% of tree deaths in some regions. Researchers now warn that failing to account for this hidden force could undermine forest conservation and climate models alike.
