South Africa’s cities face growing threats to their water resources, especially rivers, as rapid development and climate change undermine the health of water systems and the ecosystem services they provide. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to serious flood risks during extreme weather events.Without effective river management, cities risk losing out on valuable financial, socioeconomic, human and ecological benefits. In contrast, well-managed rivers enhance the delivery of municipal services, improve adaptation capacity and boost resilience to climate shocks.The eThekwini Municipality, which includes the city of Durban, is one of the first South African cities to take steps to protect and revitalize its rivers. Its work has become an example for others to follow, including Johannesburg, where WRI and partners are helping improve its water resilience.What Did eThekwini Do to Build Water Resilience?eThekwini’s rapid economic growth, intense urbanization and climate change have degraded its natural ecosystems. Many of its rivers and coastlines are affected by pollution, while its coastal forests and wetlands are being lost to housing development or invasive species.In response to climate-induced environmental damage to communities and infrastructure, eThekwini Municipality launched South Africa’s first Transformative Riverine Management Program (TRMP) in 2020. With support from C40 City Finance Facility, eThekwini embarked on the long journey of transforming the management of its rivers and bringing them back to life.&nbsp; Through the TRMP — eThekwini has developed a high-level roadmap and business case for the rehabilitation and protection of its riverine assets.&nbsp;Its TRMP was the first to clearly link effective riverine management with the longevity of both natural and urban infrastructure and showed how every rand spent would yield 1.8 to 3.4 times in holistic benefits. eThekwini also created its Catchment Partnership Development Frameworks to guide climate adaptation and risk mitigation in specific river catchments, using spatial planning and corridor management to protect residents and infrastructure.Johannesburg Co-Develops Plan to Build Water ResilienceThrough the SUNCASA (Scaling Urban Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa) project, WRI and International Institute of Sustainable Development (IISD) are working with local partners to restore the riverine areas of the Upper Jukskei River and enhance urban forestry. The consortium of local partners includes the City of Johannesburg, Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo, Zutari, Johannesburg Inner City Partnership, Alexandra Water Warriors, GenderCC and Water for the Future.Johannesburg, along with neighboring municipalities Tshwane and Ekurhuleni, has one of the region’s highest population densities and most degraded rivers whose hydrological boundaries are shared between the cities. The buildup of solid waste and debris, along with alien invasive plants, in the Jukskei River has increased flood risk.Through the SUNCASA project, Zutari is leading the development of a TRMP, which includes a riverine management program and business case for the restoration of the Upper Jukskei — highlighting the first 15-kilometer (9-mile) stretch from the start of the river in the city center to Alexandra.Initial TRMP assessments indicate that neighborhoods like Alexandra present the greatest opportunity for intervention. Hydro-ecological and socioeconomic vulnerability assessments found that infrastructure and communities near Queen’s Wetland in Bez Valley and Alexandra — where flood plains have been transformed or encroached — are most at risk. The assessments highlight how apartheid-era inequalities have left high-density, low-income neighborhoods especially vulnerable to climate, economic and social risks. A Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) model was used to develop high-level flood extents for the Jukskei River’s path across Johannesburg.

Johannesburg also shared why it embarked on developing a TRMP and reported on progress to date.Takeaways from the Exchange:Rivers cross borders: In Gauteng, rivers flow in and out of different municipalities. It is important, particularly in this region, that local governments work together to address riverine management.Collecting learning accelerates progress: Sharing insights and knowledge across municipalities is essential for regional urban resilience.Shared responsibility: Local governments must work closely with all stakeholders — including all city government departments, civil society organizations, communities and the private sector — to drive action toward urban water resilience. Strong partnerships and communication channels create the enabling environment needed for greater impact. caption: The knowledge exchange between four municipalities shared insights from eThekwini’s TRMP experience to help other South African cities develop their own programs.

Zutari and partners will also prepare an implementation framework and investment briefs to support the city in scaling up riverine management.WRI will continue facilitating collaboration between Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni through the SUNCASA project and, together with IISD, will also support the city in structuring funding opportunities. This will help expand the TRMP approach to other river systems in Johannesburg and neighboring municipalities, building urban resilience through integrated catchment management.To scale these efforts, WRI’s Green-Gray Infrastructure Accelerator aims to embed nature-positive approaches in urban development through policy instruments, a portfolio of Green-Gray Infrastructure projects and innovative financing to deliver climate-resilient outcomes in Johannesburg.
