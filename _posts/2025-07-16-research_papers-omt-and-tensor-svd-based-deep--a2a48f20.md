Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceAccurate characterization of glioma is essential for effective clinical decision-making. Most current studies involve a limited number of patients and focus solely on single-gene tasks. This research introduces a novel deep learning model ...
