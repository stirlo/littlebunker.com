Abstract Based on observational data from 17 typhoons affecting Shanghai between 2012 and 2020, this study investigates the spatial characteristics of typhoon rainfall, with a multi‐case composite analysis. The results show that storm total rainfall in the urban area is approximately 20% higher than in the rural area. Moreover, the chance of storm total precipitation exceeding 100 mm in the urban area is approximately 2.7 times higher than that in the rural area. This spatial disparity underscores the impact of urban dynamical effects, where reduced local urban wind speeds contribute to a twofold difference in urban‐rural wind speeds, thereby enhancing the near‐surface convergence and rainfall in urban areas. Conversely, minimal spatial variations in thermal and moisture conditions indicate negligible influences from urban heat island and other thermodynamic factors.
