Abstract Tornadic tropical cyclones (TCs) in China occur at a similar frequency to those in the U.S., yet the number of TC tornadoes in China is only 16.5% of that in the U.S. This study reveals that one reason is that tornadic TCs in China have shorter track lengths, fewer recurving tracks, and more southerly locations when producing tornadoes. The other reason is TCs' less tornado‐conducive environments in China. TC environments in China are more dynamically favorable but less thermodynamically conducive to tornadogenesis relative to the U.S. The composite impact is that the regions with the most favorable thermodynamic and kinematic conditions mismatch in China, with the former in the southwest quadrant and the latter in the northeast quadrant of TCs, whereas they overlap in the northeast quadrant in the U.S. and thus lead to a larger composite parameter. This mismatch in China primarily stems from tornadic TCs in southern China.
