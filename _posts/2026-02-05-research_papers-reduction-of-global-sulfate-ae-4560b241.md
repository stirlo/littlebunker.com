Abstract Anthropogenic emissions over China have recently declined due to environmental actions. This work estimates the sensitivity of sulfate aerosol (SO4 ${\\text{SO}}_{4}$) concentration to the amount of SO2 ${\\text{SO}}_{2}$ emissions reduction over China from 2010 to 2020 using an Earth system model with two different aerosol representations. We find that a larger rate of SO2 ${\\text{SO}}_{2}$ emissions decline over 2010–2020 from an updated Chinese emission inventory leads to improvement in modeled SO2 ${\\text{SO}}_{2}$ and SO4 ${\\text{SO}}_{4}$ concentrations when evaluated with targeted airborne observations from the Asian summer monsoon region from the 2022 Asian summer monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project. Updated Chinese SO2 ${\\text{SO}}_{2}$ emissions reduce SO4 ${\\text{SO}}_{4}$ concentration by >20% at 200 hPa over the North Pacific, and by >7% at 100 hPa throughout the tropics. These SO4 ${\\text{SO}}_{4}$ reductions result in an increase to global net instantaneous radiative forcing of ∼ ${\\sim} $0.10–0.15 W m−2 ${\\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ by 2020, with regional effects up to ∼ ${\\sim} $6 times greater.
