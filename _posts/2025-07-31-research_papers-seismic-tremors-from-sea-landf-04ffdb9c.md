Abstract The mechanical state of Arctic landfast sea ice remains poorly constrained due to limited observations. This study investigates interactions between drifting sea ice and the coastal landfast ice near Utqiaġvik, Alaska by integrating data from broadband seismometer, Distributed Acoustic Sensing, and marine radar. We find that decreases in sea ice velocity, marking transitions from drift to compressive contact, coincide with increased seismic energy. Tremor characteristics vary seasonally with ice conditions. In January, dense ice packs produced sustained harmonic tremors with gliding and U‐shaped spectral features, consistent with repetitive stick‐slip motion at the ice–ice or ice–ground interface under velocity‐weakening friction. In April, smaller fragmented floes generated short‐lived, chaotic tremors linked to brittle failure and spatially dispersed impacts. These findings demonstrate that seismic tremors encode the mechanical properties of interacting ice, offering a new tool to distinguish ice regimes and monitor evolving Arctic coastal dynamics under climate change.
