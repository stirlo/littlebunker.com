Nature Climate Change, Published online: 28 July 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02387-xProlonged low wind speeds can lead to a strong reduction in wind power generation. Here, the authors show that such wind drought events become more frequent and extended under global warming, threatening energy security in some regions.
