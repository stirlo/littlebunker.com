Abstract Accurate forecasts of near‐landfall TC characteristics (direction, translation speed, and intensity) are essential for timely disaster preparedness. Using best‐track data (1951–2023), this study reveals a significant pre‐landfall acceleration of TCs along the South China coast, with translation speed increasing by 35.5% and 16.4% during the 24 hr prior to landfall for eastbound and westbound cases, respectively. This acceleration is primarily contributed by the normal component of the translation vector. For westbound TCs, translation speed and its normal component increase with intensity, particularly at typhoon strength and above. Numerical simulations and diagnostic analyses attribute the acceleration to horizontal advection and diabatic heating, primarily driven by land‐induced asymmetric flow and convection. These findings strengthen the current understanding of TC motion dynamics and support more effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies as TCs approach coastal regions.
