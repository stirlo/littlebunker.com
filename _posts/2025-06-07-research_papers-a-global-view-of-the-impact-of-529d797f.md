Abstract This manuscript utilizes the global survey of electron precipitation due to chorus and hiss waves based on waves and electron flux measurements made by Van Allen Probes. To analyze the loss‐cone precipitation presented in these papers, we compared electron energy fluxes and their mean energies entering the ionospheric altitudes on the global scale based on UCLA Full Diffusion (UCLA code) and NASA SuperThermal ElecTrons codes and reveal the role of magnetosphere‐ionosphere‐atmosphere (MIA) energy interplay in the formation these values. This information is used for calculation of height‐integrated ionospheric conductance in the presence of both hiss and chorus waves activities involving in electron precipitation of energy fluxes. MIA coupling phenomena increases Pederson and Hall conductance up to factors of 2–2.3 and 1.7–1.9, correspondingly.
