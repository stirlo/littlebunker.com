Abstract Previous studies suggest that convectively coupled Kelvin waves (KWs) are likely maintained by two distinct processes: (a) the internal thermodynamic feedback between KW diabatic heating and temperature, and (b) the external momentum forcing from the midlatitude Rossby waves exerting on the KW zonal wind. This study quantifies the relative importance of the two processes on KW maintenance by comparing the growth rates of eddy available potential energy (EAPE) and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) within KWs using satellite and reanalysis data. Results show that the growth rate of KW EAPE is greater than that of KW EKE in most regions and seasons, while their relative magnitude varies across different regions and seasons. The observed relative importance of the two maintenance processes can serve as a reference for numerical simulations of KWs.
