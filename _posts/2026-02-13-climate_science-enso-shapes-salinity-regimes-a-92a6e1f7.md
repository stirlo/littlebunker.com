Nature Climate Change, Published online: 13 February 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-026-02559-3This study shows that the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives sea surface salinity (SSS) variability in the China Seas through coupled freshwater and oceanic processes, influencing regional fisheries. Under a warming climate, projected intensification of ENSO will amplify SSS heterogeneity.
