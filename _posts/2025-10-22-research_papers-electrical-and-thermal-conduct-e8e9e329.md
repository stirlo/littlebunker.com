Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 42, October 2025. SignificanceThe Earth’s early magnetic field may have been powered by a molten silicate layer deep in the mantle, known as the basal magma ocean. As this layer gradually crystallized, it became increasingly enriched in iron, which influences its physical ...
