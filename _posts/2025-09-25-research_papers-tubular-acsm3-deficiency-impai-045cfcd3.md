Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 38, September 2025. SignificanceFatty acid oxidation disturbance is a hallmark of kidney fibrosis. Here, we found that acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3), a key enzyme in medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) metabolism, played a crucial role in ...
