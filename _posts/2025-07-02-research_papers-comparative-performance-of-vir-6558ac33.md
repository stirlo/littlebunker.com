Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceThanks to their rapid evolution, viral genomes can be analyzed and compared to estimate the dispersal history of the virus responsible for an epidemic, a task known as phylogeographic inference. In our study, we develop and evaluate the ...
