Abstract The vertical distribution of aerosols in the upper troposphere (UT) and lower stratosphere is critical for aerosol‐cloud interactions. Balloon‐borne measurements in Golmud, over the northern Tibetan Plateau revealed enhanced particle backscatter and number concentrations in the UT and up to 0.5 km above the tropopause on 27 March 2021. The aerosol surface area distribution near the tropopause (12.47 ± 1 km) exhibited bimodal peaks at ∼0.2 and ∼2.21 μm, differing from the typical unimodal Asian tropopause aerosol layer. Backward trajectory calculations demonstrate that a dust storm over Middle East and northeastern Africa around 24 March transported dust from the lower troposphere to the UT, strongly influencing the observed aerosol profile in Golmud. These results highlight the long‐range transport of dust aerosols to the UTLS and their role in modifying vertical aerosol distribution in remote regions.
