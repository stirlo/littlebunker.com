Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 40, October 2025. SignificanceThis finding challenges and expands previous models of gyroid formation in butterflies, highlighting a mechanism based on the packing of fibrillar helical elements. By uncovering this natural blueprint, our work opens pathways for the ...
