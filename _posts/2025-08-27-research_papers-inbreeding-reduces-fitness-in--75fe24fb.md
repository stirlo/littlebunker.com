Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 34, August 2025. SignificanceInbreeding depression—decreased fitness caused by parental relatedness—can reduce population viability and thus is a frequent focus in conservation. However, such effects are difficult to detect in wild populations because it is challenging to ...
