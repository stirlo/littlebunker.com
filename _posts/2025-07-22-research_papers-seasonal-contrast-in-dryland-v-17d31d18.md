Understanding vegetation sensitivity to drought in South Asia is essential due to the region’s exposure to frequent, seasonally varying drought driven by complex hydroclimatic factors. This study addresses a significant knowledge gap by investigating seasonal vegetation-drought sensitivity using multiple vegetation indicators and the influence of hydroclimatic factors. Our results show vegetation-drought sensitivity peaks in spring, rising from 0.2 in summer to 0.6, with drought-prone areas expanding from 40% to 60%. Along with drought-vegetation sensitivities, the other hydroclimatic factor’s role played a wide range of dependency on the phenological stages of vegetation. For instance, a statistically significant positive correlation between increasing soil moisture–temperature coupling and decreased vegetation growth was detected from spring to summer in Pakistan and India, with an average sensitivity of 0.2–0.6 in all seasons. Vapor pressure deficit dominates vegetation responses, especially in summer and autumn, with central and northwestern croplands showing higher sensitivity, while humid northeastern parts remain resilient. Elevated aCO2 amplifies drought effects in the spring, highlighting the vital role of seasonal water balance and hydroclimatic dynamics. Policy-makers should integrate these insights into regional drought management and climate adaptation strategies to support sustainable agricultural practices and ecosystem conservation.
