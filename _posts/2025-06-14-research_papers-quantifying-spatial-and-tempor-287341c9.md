Abstract We present a novel method to quantify the event‐specific spatial evolution of plasmaspheric hiss wave power using a Drift‐Diffusion model. Constrained by Polar Operational Environmental Satellites/Meteorological Operational Satellites data, the model simulates low‐altitude electron distributions, accounting for azimuthal drift, pitch‐angle diffusion, and atmospheric backscatter. Applying to an event on 15 October 2016, the model quantifies the spatial evolution of hiss waves at L = 3.9, which contributes to the steady decay of electron flux observed by Van Allen Probes (VAPs). The model reproduces local‐time dependent features and shows excellent agreement with hiss wave power observed by VAPs. The model shows increased wave power and spatial spread following increased activities in the AL‐index, consistent with previous statistical results. The model also suggests the presence of “low”‐frequency hiss, which was undetected by VAPs, likely masked by instrument noise. This is the first time low‐altitude measurements are used to quantify event‐specific wave distributions which include both diffusion and drift effects.
