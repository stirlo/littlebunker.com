Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 47, November 2025. SignificanceChirality, a fundamental property of living systems, manifests in cell collectives by their biased directional swirling. Despite the identification of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in driving the internal chiral symmetry break occurring in cells,...
