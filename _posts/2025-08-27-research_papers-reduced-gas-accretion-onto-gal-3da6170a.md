Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 34, August 2025. SignificancePowerful radio jets released by accreting supermassive black holes are a significant source of magnetic energy in the Universe. By cosmic noon (redshift 2 to 3), the jet-inflated radio lobes extend beyond their host galaxies and inject a ...
