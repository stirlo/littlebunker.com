BONN, GERMANY (June 26, 2025) — The 2025 UN climate talks concluded today in Bonn after a challenging start, with a two-day delay over the agenda cutting into negotiation time. As a mid-year checkpoint before COP30, the largely technical talks aimed to bring countries closer on core issues including adaptation, mitigation and finance. While some progress emerged, political tensions slowed momentum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is a statement from David Waskow, Director, International Climate Initiative, World Resources Institute:“With four months to go before COP30, leaders need to start delivering: they need to put forward strong national plans to cut emissions and transform key sectors; scale up climate finance from all sources; and urgently implement and mainstream adaptation and resilience to protect lives, economies, and security. With the 1.5°C window closing fast, every fraction of a degree — and every decision — matters.“Persistent political tensions and competing agendas led to limited and uneven progress in Bonn. Delegates did lay essential groundwork for better measuring adaptation — a key part for planning and accountability – and made some headway on just transition issues. What’s now needed is a strong dose of decisive, coordinated action to deliver real results.“There can be no further delays in achieving the Global Stocktake priorities set in 2023 - from transitioning away from fossil fuels to tripling renewables, doubling energy efficiency and ending deforestation. Moving forward requires bold, system-wide change across every sector, driven by all levels of government, business, and civil society, recommitting to the Paris Agreement — together.”&nbsp;
