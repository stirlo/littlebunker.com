Abstract We conduct a statistical analysis of multiple bow shock (BS) crossings at Mars. Data from the magnetometer (MAG) and Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft from its first 2 years in orbit is used to identify flapping events. These are interpreted as the bow shock moving toward and away from Mars. 9% of all MAVEN passes occur when the BS is flapping. Such events are more common on the flanks than on the ramside and more common at southern dayside latitudes than in the north. The probability of flapping increases with increased dynamic pressure and decreased Mach number. The distribution of shock velocity and shock jump differ from the single‐BS cases. The shock moves in a swaying motion on the time scale of minutes, and such dynamics could influence other processes at Mars, such as plasma waves, wave‐particle interaction, and ion acceleration.
