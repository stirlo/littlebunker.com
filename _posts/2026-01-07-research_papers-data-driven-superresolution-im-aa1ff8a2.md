Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 1, January 2026. SignificanceImaging in complex, disordered environments, such as biological tissues, turbulent atmosphere, or cluttered underwater regions, is notoriously difficult because multiple scattering distorts waves. Harnessing large datasets and advanced ...
