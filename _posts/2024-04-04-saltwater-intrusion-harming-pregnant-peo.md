            Article Summary: Pregnant people in Bangladesh are suffering from alarming rates of negative health effects tied to rising salinity in drinking water due to sea level rise and climate-fueled cyclones, The Guardian reports. Increased salt intake can lead to hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia — all of which can have dire, potentially deadly, effects on both the pregnant person and fetus. “When Cyclone Aila hit in 2009, it left behind a trail of destruction, breaching embankments and leaving the entire region submerged in salt water,” said Dr. Santosh Kumar, a gynecologist in&nbsp;Dacope. “With most freshwater infrastructure destroyed, the coastal region has been facing an acute drinking water crisis. The extent of the impact on people’s health is only now being realized.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Climate Signals background:&nbsp;Sea-level rise,&nbsp;Cyclones)Full Story Link:&nbsp;The GuardianTo receive climate stories like this in your inbox daily click here to sign up for the Hot News Newsletter from Climate Nexus:&nbsp;https://newsletter.climatenexus.org/hot-news-sign-up
