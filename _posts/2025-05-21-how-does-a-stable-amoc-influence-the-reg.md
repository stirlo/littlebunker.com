Abstract
Despite the recently recomputed time series of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) suggesting greater stability than previously recognized, AMOC retains the potential to influence regional climate fluctuations across multiple timescales through its considerable variability. The sloshing component of AMOC has been identified as a significant mode of short‐term AMOC variability. While it does not cause permanent changes to the AMOC, this sloshing mode can reshape the ocean's thermal state by redistributing warmer water in the upper layers and altering both basin‐wide and regional ocean heat content (OHC). This study examines how the sloshing AMOC component regulates meridional heat transport and OHC across different timescales in the North Atlantic. It offers insights into the mechanism through which the AMOC could affect regional climate variability, even if it maintains a stable strength in the foreseeable future.
