Abstract Although diverse climates shape complex vegetation distribution globally, how climate heterogeneity regulates the impact of climate change on vegetation migration remains unclear. In this study, we used high‐resolution Köppen‐Geiger climate classifications to assess climate heterogeneity across the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau from 1990 to 2020. We found that areas with higher climate heterogeneity support greater vegetation adaptability and migration potential in response to changing climate conditions. Including climate heterogeneity in species distribution models clearly confirmed that climate heterogeneity promotes vegetation migration. Our results show that while rising temperatures generally limit vegetation migration, climate heterogeneity can help offset this effect by offering climatic refugia and expanding suitable habitat ranges. The interaction between climate heterogeneity and temperature increase had a positive moderating effect. By incorporating this factor, our approach provides a more accurate understanding of vegetation dynamics and supports the development of adaptive conservation strategies for biodiversity.
