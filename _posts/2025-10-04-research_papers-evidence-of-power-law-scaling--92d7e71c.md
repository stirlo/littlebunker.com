Abstract We report the first quantitative analysis of statistical scaling of dissolution rates driving nanoscale self‐organization of the interface between a mineral and flowing water. Our study provides evidence of emergence of cross‐over between two power‐law scaling regimes characterized by distinct levels of persistence. We tie these to the action of nanoscale features of dissolution patterns and capture experimental behaviors through a new theoretical framework. This opens unprecedented avenues to analyze chemical weathering imprinting alterations of mineral‐water interfaces.
