Abstract Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition affects soil nitrate (NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$) dynamics in forests, yet mechanisms driving NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ accumulation in semi‐arid regions remain unclear. Here, we quantified atmospheric and microbial contributions to soil NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ by analyzing 17O anomalies in 26 semi‐arid forests under high N deposition in northern China. Heavier N‐polluted temperate forests showed lower 17O anomalies in soil NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ (1.0‰ ± 0.8‰), indicating lower atmospheric contributions (4.2% ± 3.2%), but higher atmospheric concentrations (0.3 ± 0.3 mg N kg−1) and microbial nitrification rates (459.7 ± 225.4 kg N ha−1 yr−1). Both contribution and concentration of atmospheric NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ in soils increased with NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ inputs, whereas nitrification rate positively correlated with N deposition independent of precipitation, suggesting deposited N pollutants rather than water as a main driver of soil NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ production and accumulation. These findings are important for understanding sources and accumulation of NO3– ${{\text{NO}}_{3}}^{\mbox{--}}$ in temperate forests under N deposition.
