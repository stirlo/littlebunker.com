Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. SignificanceThis work demonstrates that neurons have an active glycogen metabolism that can support synapse function during metabolic stress. Furthermore, we found that access to glycogen is actively shaped by local neuromodulation. This provides a ...
