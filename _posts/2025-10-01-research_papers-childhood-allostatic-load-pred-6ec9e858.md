Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 39, September 2025. SignificanceOur findings demonstrate the effect of early-life physiological dysregulation on mid-life cardiometabolic outcomes. Higher levels of allostatic load measured in childhood were associated with chronic, noncommunicable disease risk factors in ...
