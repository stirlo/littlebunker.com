WASHINGTON (MAY 22, 2025) — Today, the U.S. Senate approved Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency’s waivers of federal preemption for the Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC2), Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) and the Heavy-Duty Omnibus vehicle emissions programs. This follows the House of Representatives’ approval of CRA resolutions targeting ACT and the Heavy-Duty Omnibus vehicle emissions program on April 30th, 2025 and ACCII on May 1st, 2025. The Senate Parliamentarian had previously determined that these waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act.Following is a statement from Dan Lashof, Senior Fellow at World Resources Institute: &nbsp; &nbsp;“Today’s votes in the Senate fly in the face of nearly 50 years of precedent. For decades, California and other states have had the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that exceed those at the federal level – and for good reason. These standards are vital in protecting people from the vehicle pollution which causes asthma attacks and other serious health problems.“Moreover, the U.S. auto industry’s competitiveness in the global market depends on innovation which has historically been and continues to be driven by California standards. &nbsp;“People across the country want cleaner, more efficient cars, trucks and school buses and the cleaner air that results. Today’s unprecedented votes against these preemption waivers throw years of progress into reverse.”&nbsp;
