Nature Climate Change, Published online: 11 July 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02362-6Global datasets of surface temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) are routinely used in climate change studies. Here the authors show that while surface temperature datasets closely agree, four main SST datasets show substantial variation, with implications for their application.
