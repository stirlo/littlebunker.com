BRUSSELS (November 5, 2025) - Today, the EU Council&nbsp;reaffirmed the bloc’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. While this underscores Europe’s long-term ambition, up to 5% of the reductions are expected to come from carbon offsets outside the EU, with an agreement to periodically review the plan.&nbsp;The EU ministers also confirmed the European Commission’s earlier “statement of intent” for the 2035 nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions by 66.25–72.5% from 1990 levels. The NDC will be a key input into the COP30 climate summit in Brazil next week.&nbsp;Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, World Resources Institute:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The EU’s 90% target reflects the level of ambition this moment demands and stands out as one of the most ambitious commitments in the world. Finalizing it just ahead of COP30 shows that the bloc is determined to arrive at the summit with a serious contribution to tackling the climate crisis, and signals that it recognizes climate action as central to Europe's economic future.”&nbsp;&nbsp;“Europe’s climate competitiveness and energy independence will not be secured through hesitation or outsourcing. Keeping the door open to revising climate measures creates uncertainty for businesses that need long-term investment security. The announcement to revise and postpone the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS-2), while leaving open the possibility of additional offsets, adds to this unpredictability. The exact way these provisions will be applied will determine the EU's actual speed of transition.”&nbsp;“The EU’s 2035 target is a solid step toward reaching its longer-term climate goals, but only if the bloc strives for the highest end of its target. &nbsp;WRI analysis shows the EU must cut emissions by 72.5% to stay on track for 1.5°C. It would also allow for a smoother emissions reduction towards the 90% goal, rather than relying on steeps cuts after 2035. Falling short would create an unmanageable gap and would undermine investor confidence in Europe’s long-term transition.&nbsp;“By phasing out fossil fuels and investing in clean energy and innovation, the EU can cut energy dependence and build a more resilient domestic economy in an increasingly volatile world. Any use of carbon credits&nbsp;requires strong guardrails to ensure they meet robust social and environmental standards, are fully transparent, and truly deliver additional emission cuts. &nbsp;&nbsp;“The EU must come to COP30 ready to deliver — with the tools, commitments, and measures needed to turn ambition into action and push other countries to advance ambitious plans as&nbsp;well.”&nbsp;
