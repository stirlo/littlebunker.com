Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceMany real-world networks change dynamically but can be notoriously difficult to study. We introduce a graph edit process that, at each step, randomly selects and applies an edit (e.g., adding or deleting an edge, or several edges in tandem) to ...
