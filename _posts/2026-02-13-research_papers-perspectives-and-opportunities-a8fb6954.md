The use of biochar technology in Brazil holds significant promise for advancing the principles of a circular economy, addressing pressing environmental challenges, and fostering sustainable development. Despite its great potential, biochar production and scale use remain strikingly limited in Brazil. Here, we explored the multifaceted potential of biochar in Brazil, focusing on its capacity to promote circularity, create novel inputs for agricultural and environmental purposes, and optimize infrastructure for the production and cycling of organic residues from diverse agricultural and energy production chains. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders, and a workshop was organized with participants representing universities, public research institutes, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. We analyzed the current Brazilian scenario, identifying the main barriers preventing the widespread use of biochar in the country, as well as possible solutions in the economic, political, technological, research and development, and innovation sectors. Based on this assessment, our results show that stakeholders view the Brazilian biochar sector as emerging but constrained by regulatory uncertainty, market fragmentation, and logistical bottlenecks. They identified five priority levers for change: the creation of clear and credible regulatory frameworks, region-specific strategies for biomass use and on-farm deployment, integration of biochar into robust carbon market mechanisms, strengthening of targeted research and demonstration projects, and development of business models that combine agricultural benefits, carbon removal, and co-products.
