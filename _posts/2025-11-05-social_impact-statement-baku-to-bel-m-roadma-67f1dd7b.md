BELÉM (November 5, 2025) —Today, the COP presidencies of Azerbaijan and Brazil published the Baku to Belém Roadmap to $1.3T. This report represents a key output agreed to at COP29, detailing how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baku to Belém Roadmap presents numerous options for increasing investment in climate to reach this scale. Delivering on this will be critical for COP30’s focus on moving from commitments to action. &nbsp; &nbsp;Following is a statement from Melanie Robinson, Global Director of Climate, Economics and Finance at World Resources Institute:&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Baku to Belém Roadmap turns a promise made at COP29 into a plan. It charts a smart, holistic strategy to deliver $1.3 trillion a year in climate finance for developing countries, and start transforming the global economy, starting now.&nbsp;“The roadmap’s value is in its combination of pragmatism with a focus on scale and systems change. For too long, the climate community has been overly focused on relatively modest sums of public climate funding, whereas the Baku to Belém plan rightly shifts the lens to how a wider set of public finance and policy shifts can unlock much larger flows from private investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;“As Brazil and Azerbaijan rightly note, tackling the climate crisis means rewiring the financial system so that all actors pull in the same direction, from development banks and private capital providers to public policy makers and financial regulators. Thanks to input from the Circle of Finance Ministers, the roadmap is grounded in tackling the real-world challenges that finance ministers and other financial actors face. As the economic case grows ever clearer, this is exactly what’s needed to drive large-scale investment in clean energy, resilient agriculture and adaptation — creating jobs, strengthening economies and reducing risk.&nbsp;“With this roadmap in hand, COP30 must pivot from plans on paper to investment at scale. Success in Belém will depend on whether all sources of finance can work together to align behind country-led priorities, and whether scarce grants go where they are needed most. The roadmap shows how to reach $1.3 trillion — now the world must deliver.”&nbsp;&nbsp;
