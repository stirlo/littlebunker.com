				The narratives we choose can define the policies and culture we get. This is true of climate-driven migration as much as any other issue.
The election of Donald Trump and a new wave of authoritarian politics in Europe has left many climate advocates wondering how to respond. Humane policies on human movement feel more distant, and robust climate policy feels under threat. Some climate advocates may potentially turn to fear-based narratives about climate-driven mobility as a way of tapping into this new political moment. Others may seek to distance their campaigns and organisations from those working on migration, hoping to protect themselves from backlash.
This paper makes the case that neither of these approaches is the right strategy for this political moment. The paper makes the case for narratives grounded in justice and for solidarity between the climate, migration, and refugee rights movements.
