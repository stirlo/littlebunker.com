Abstract The next‐generation geostationary satellites are expected to have hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounders, providing hemispheric coverage of satellite‐derived vertical profiles of temperature, moisture, and wind in clear skies and above clouds. Derivation of winds, or atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs), from IR hyperspectral sounders was first demonstrated using Aqua Atmospheric Infrared Sounder retrievals. The AMVs on discrete pressure levels (3D winds) provided, for the first time, vertical profiles of wind information in the polar regions. Since then, the capability has been extended to tracking features in global profile retrievals of humidity and ozone derived from Cross‐track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer radiances. And, it is now demonstrated for the first time globally using retrievals at single field‐of‐view resolution from successive overpasses of three CrIS instruments on NOAA‐21, NOAA‐20, and SNPP flying in formation. 3D winds from polar‐orbiting satellites can provide all‐latitude (“global”) coverage giving insight into capabilities when all geostationary satellites are equipped with IR sounders.
