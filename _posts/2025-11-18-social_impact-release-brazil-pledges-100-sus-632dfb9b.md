Part of a global wave of commitments, Brazil's announcement underscores the ocean's critical role in tackling the climate crisisBelém, Brazil (November 18, 2025) – Today at COP30 in Belém, Brazil announced a landmark commitment to sustainably manage all 3.68 million km² of its national waters by 2030. Joining the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel) as its nineteenth member, Brazil brings important leadership and momentum to ocean-climate action.Brazil's ocean area is the tenth largest in the world, and boasts the longest coastline in South America. Its waters underpin an ocean economy that contributes roughly 19% of Brazil's GDP, supports 3.5 million jobs in fisheries and aquaculture and drives around 70% of national tourism revenue.“Without the ocean, we cannot truly confront climate change. We must harness its immense potential to reduce emissions and protect our coasts from extreme weather,” said Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil. “The ocean is central to Brazil’s culture, diet and livelihoods, and building a sustainable ocean economy will open new opportunities for Brazilians. That’s why we have joined the Ocean Panel in its vision to safeguard the ocean and use its resources wisely and responsibly.” &nbsp;The country is also home to the world's second-largest area of mangroves, which can store up to five times more carbon per area than tropical forests and absorb it from the atmosphere about three times faster. These vital ecosystems protect coastlines from severe weather and serve as nurseries for a diverse array of marine life – playing a crucial role in climate mitigation, adaptation and food security.The Ocean Panel, co-chaired by Norway and Palau, and supported by a Secretariat housed at World Resources Institute, brings together heads of state and government from nineteen countries to accelerate sustainable use and protection of the world’s ocean areas. Members, including Brazil, have committed to producing national Sustainable Ocean Plans (SOPs) within five years, guiding sustainable management of 100% of ocean areas under their national jurisdiction.Earlier this year at the United Nations Ocean Conference, Brazil joined France to launch the Blue NDC Challenge, an initiative designed to help countries strengthen and implement ocean-climate actions within their national climate commitments. Research from the Ocean Panel shows that ocean-based climate solutions could deliver up to 35% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2050 – a significant opportunity that remains largely untapped. &nbsp;“The Ocean Panel represents a diverse range of countries, but our ambition remains the same: the ocean must be central to our collective future.” said H.E. Surangel S. Whipps Jr., President of Palau and Co-Chair of the Ocean Panel. “Brazil presides over a vast ocean area and in committing to 100% sustainable management, it strengthens not just its own future but the future of every ocean-dependent nation.”“The Ocean Panel provides a platform for promoting better understanding of the economic importance and environmental status of the ocean,” said Jonas Gahr Støre, Prime Minister of Norway and fellow Co-chair of the Ocean Panel. “It greatly strengthens the Panel that a significant coastal nation like Brazil now has decided to join. The ocean is essential for the well-being of all people, as it sustains livelihoods, regulates our climate, and provides vital resources for future generations.” &nbsp;This year, ten countries outside the Ocean Panel – Panama, the Republic of Korea and eight African nations (Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria) – have also pledged to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters. &nbsp;Panama and the Republic of Korea made their commitments through the 100% Alliance, an Ocean Panel campaign that encourages all coastal and ocean states to make similar commitments, while the African nations adopted the Yaoundé Declaration to advance the same goal. &nbsp;These growing commitments signal a rising recognition among nations of the ocean’s vital role in tackling the climate crisis. &nbsp;Notes to EditorsMedia contact: Sophie Brady, sophie.brady@wri.org&nbsp;About the Ocean Panel &nbsp;Co-chaired by Norway and Palau, and supported by the Secretariat housed at World Resources Institute, the Ocean Panel includes Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau, Portugal, Seychelles, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and now Brazil. &nbsp;Together, these 19 nations represent 42% of the world’s coastlines, 40% of global Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), 19% of the world’s fisheries and marine aquaculture and 21% of the world’s shipping fleet.The Ocean Panel is supported by the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Ocean.
