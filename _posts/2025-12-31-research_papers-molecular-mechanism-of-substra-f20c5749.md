Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 52, December 2025. SignificancePeroxisomes are involved in essential cellular metabolic processes that include fatty acid oxidation, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification. The ABCD subfamily of membrane transporter proteins transport fatty acyl-CoA molecules from the ...
