Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 52, December 2025. SignificanceWe show through tryptophan fluorescence that lipid-packing defects (low lipid-packing density) are required for α-synuclein–membrane insertion, while net negative charge is not. We additionally find that on lower defect membranes, the bound ...
