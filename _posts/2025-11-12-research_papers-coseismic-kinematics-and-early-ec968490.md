Abstract The 2025 Mw ${\\mathrm{M}}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ 7.1 Dingri earthquake is a large normal‐faulting event within the Southern Tibet Rift System. We use space‐borne radar interferometry to investigate both coseismic rupture and ∼3‐month early afterslip. Results show that this event ruptured a west‐dipping (48°) fault, exhibiting a predominant normal dip‐slip of 4.7 m and a left‐lateral strike‐slip component of 3.2 m. Postseismic moment release (Mw ${\\mathrm{M}}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ 6.47) contributes 14.2% of the coseismic moment, predominantly (59%) from shallow afterslip (<28 km; maximum 0.3 m) exceeding the contribution from deep afterslip (<28 km; maximum 0.1 m). We find a depth‐dependent control on postseismic process: at 0–10 km, both 49% of aftershocks and substantial afterslip are driven by coseismic stress increases. Conversely, at 10–20 km depth, afterslip‐induced stress perturbations dominate, hosting 64% of aftershocks. The coseismic rupture kinematics reflect shallow crustal responses to deep tectonic processes, likely driven by the tearing of the Indian slab beneath southern Tibet.
