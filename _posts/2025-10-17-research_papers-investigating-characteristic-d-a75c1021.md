Abstract Cloud processes relevant to radiative and precipitation properties depend on the shape of the cloud droplet size distribution. Recent holographic observations revealed that cloud droplet populations do not have the same size distribution shapes throughout but form regions of characteristic distributions with similar microphysical properties. We investigate the existence and properties of these characteristic distributions within Large‐Eddy Simulations of stratocumulus clouds using Lagrangian and bin microphysics schemes. Distribution types are identified, revealing localized characteristic distributions that vary on the scale of the largest convective cell for simulations with bin microphysics. The results from the Lagrangian microphysics scheme hint at similar behavior. Compared to observations, the simulated clouds are much more uniform. Analysis of the LES results suggests a connection to the local entrainment rate, so the poorly resolved entrainment interface in LES may be a cause of the uniformity. The uniformity of the large‐scale forcing could also be a factor.
