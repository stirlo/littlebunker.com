Veteran EPA leader to guide WRI’s US Program efforts on clean energy, climate policy and sustainable development&nbsp;WASHINGTON, DC (June 10, 2025) — World Resources Institute (WRI) welcomes Dr. David Widawsky as the new Director of its US Program. Based in Washington, DC, Dr. Widawsky brings over 20 years of leadership in environmental policy, innovation and program implementation across domestic and international arenas.&nbsp;In his new role, Dr. Widawsky will lead WRI’s US Program strategy and a team of 70+ to advance climate action and sustainable development across U.S. federal, state and local levels. His focus will include the energy transition, climate policy, sustainable cities and transportation and nature-based solutions — working closely with policymakers, communities and the private sector.&nbsp;Dr. Widawsky joins WRI from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where he most recently served as the inaugural director of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a landmark initiative to channel capital into clean energy projects, particularly in underserved communities. Over his career at EPA, he also held leadership roles in the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and the National Center for Environmental Innovation.&nbsp;“I’m honored to join WRI at such a pivotal moment for climate and environmental action,” said Dr. Widawsky. “What drew me to WRI is its systems-based approach—addressing climate, environmental and social challenges together, not in silos. I look forward to working with the WRI&nbsp;US Program team to help drive a more just, sustainable and resilient future for communities nationwide.”&nbsp;&nbsp;“In today’s dynamic policy landscape, we need leaders who are both visionary and pragmatic,” said Adriana Lobo, Managing Director, Global Presence &amp; National Action, WRI. “David brings exactly that. His leadership will be key to advancing WRI’s mission, and ensuring that WRI’s contributions to U.S. climate, people, and nature progress are robust, forward-leaning and resilient.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Widawsky led &nbsp;the design and scale-up of national programs on clean energy finance, sustainable manufacturing, safer chemical use and more — building cross-sector collaborations with government, industry, academia, and philanthropy to drive impact at scale. Earlier in his career, Dr. Widawsky conducted agricultural research across Asia and served with the U.S. Department of Commerce on trade partnerships for environmental technologies.&nbsp;He holds a PhD in Applied and Development Economics from Stanford University, an MSc in Agricultural Economics from Colorado State University and bachelor’s degrees in Political Economy of Natural Resources and Plant and Soil Biology from the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;About World Resources Institute (WRI)&nbsp;WRI works to improve people’s lives, protect and restore nature and stabilize the climate. As an independent research organization, we leverage our data, expertise and global reach to influence policy and catalyze change across systems like food, land and water; energy; and cities.
