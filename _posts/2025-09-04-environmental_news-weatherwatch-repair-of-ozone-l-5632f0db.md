Scientists say ozone is warming Earth by 40% more than expected but that repair is still right thing to doThe repair of the Earth’s ozone layer has been a success, but a new study reveals a downside: ozone is warming the planet up to 40% more than originally anticipated.Bill Collins from the University of Reading and his colleagues used a computer model to project the amount of warming associated with changes in ozone between 2015 and 2050, taking into account changes in humidity, clouds and surface reflectivity. If we continue to implement the air pollution controls mandated by the Montreal protocol in 1987 their results, which are published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, suggest that the healing of the ozone layer will create more warming, cancelling out most of the climate benefits from stopping production of ozone destroying chemicals such as CFCs and HCFCs.
