In Sub-Saharan Africa, climate policies without progressive redistribution risk exacerbating poverty, potentially undermining the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) while striving to meet Paris Agreement goals. The concept of ‘just transitions,’ which integrates both environmental and social interventions, is essential for advancing climate and poverty reduction objectives. Both climate change impacts and climate action may exacerbate existing inequalities, underscoring the urgency of addressing both environmental and social justice concerns. Equally, developmental aspirations may threaten to aggravate environmentally detrimental patterns. To this end, the paper examines how domestic efforts balance climate and poverty priorities in the governance of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. It develops a conceptual framework that links the governance of climate and poverty to justice outcomes within the global political economic context, using the illustrative case of Kenya. Kenya presents a compelling case due to its relevance to the conceptual framework amidst high dependence on climate-sensitive economic sectors; aspirations both to act as a climate leader and reach middle-income status; and its high financial dependence on development partners and transnational capital. By connecting political economy dynamics to justice outcomes, the framework contributes to a deeper understanding of governance efforts that aim to link climate and poverty objectives but do not necessarily deliver a just transition. Through the case of Kenya, the paper illustrates the challenges and opportunities faced by Sub-Saharan African countries in managing the interdependence between climate and poverty reduction objectives, contributing to ongoing debates on just transitions in the global South.
