Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 1, January 2026. SignificanceAnalytic combinatorics in several variables estimates coefficients of multivariate generating functions via complex contour integration near singularities of the function. These functions encode behaviors of systems in fields ranging from ...
