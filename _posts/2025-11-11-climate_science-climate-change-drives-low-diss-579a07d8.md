Nature Climate Change, Published online: 11 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02483-yDissolved oxygen concentrations are expected to decline with rising water temperatures under climate change. This study projects declining oxygen levels for most rivers globally and an increase in hypoxic days by the end of the century, with implications for ecosystem and fish health.
