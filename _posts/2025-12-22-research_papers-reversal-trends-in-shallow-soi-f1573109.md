Abstract Soil temperature changes over the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau (QTP) exert considerable influence on regional climate. Here, we identify a distinct reversal from cooling during 1950–1983 (−0.169°C decade−1) to significant warming during 1984–2014 (0.388°C decade−1), exceeding the global average by 29%–87%. The early cooling period was mainly driven by interactions between greenhouse gases (GHG) and aerosols (AER), with AER exerting a dominant cooling influence. After 1984, the GHG contribution increased from 11.2%–29% to 40%–47.9%, leading to accelerated warming. The influence of interactions was strongly modulated by the relative dominance of GHG and AER, acting as a critical factor in the reversal and amplification of shallow‐soil temperature trend across the QTP. These findings highlight the sensitivity of high‐altitude soil thermal regimes to shifts in anthropogenic forcing.
