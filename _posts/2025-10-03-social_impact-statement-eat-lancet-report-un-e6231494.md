LONDON (October 3, 2025) —&nbsp;Today, EAT and The Lancet&nbsp;released the 2025 EAT-Lancet Commission, a major scientific update to one of the most influential food system reports of the past decade.The report outlines how to build healthy, sustainable, and just food systems within planetary boundaries, featuring new scientific evidence and scenario-based pathways to guide global food system transformation. &nbsp;&nbsp;Following is a statement by Anne Bordier, Director of Food Initiatives at World Resources institute:&nbsp;“The report drives home a vital truth: healthy, sustainable eating isn’t just a personal choice – it’s shaped by the systems that put food on our plates every day. It’s the responsibility of food providers and policymakers to make healthy diets with a low carbon footprint the easy, affordable, and irresistible option for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;“With food prices&nbsp;up over 35%&nbsp;since 2019, families are trapped in a triple bind: not enough to eat, struggling to afford nutritious food or living in environments flooded with unhealthy, unsustainable options. This is more than an economic crisis - it’s a profound equity crisis, where the most vulnerable carry the heaviest burden and face the fewest choices.”&nbsp;“Around&nbsp;40%&nbsp;of all food is wasted. Getting more out of the food we already grow is one of the easiest, most impactful steps we can take – with huge benefits for climate, health, and food security. Better storage, surplus redistribution, and clear targets can unlock healthy food for more people while conserving resources and cutting emissions. At the same time, boosting agriculture’s productivity and reducing its environmental footprint will be essential to feed a growing population while protecting nature and the climate.\\"“Meeting climate and nutrition goals won’t happen overnight –&nbsp;it takes smart investment, persistence, creativity and real collaboration. Fortunately, a&nbsp;toolbox full of solutions&nbsp;grounded in quantitative modeling,&nbsp;behavioral science, consumer insights and industry know-how already exists. The challenge now is scaling what works – making healthy, sustainable food the default, not the exception.”&nbsp;
