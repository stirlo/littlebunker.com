Chinese president Xi Jinping, in an unexpected video address at the UN, announced last week that China will aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions 7-10% below peak levels by 2035. The target was one of several new pledges that will be included in China’s 2035 nationally determined contribution (NDC), which China has yet to reveal in full. Carbon Brief has published a detailed analysis of the announcement. Yesterday, Carbon Brief hosted a webinar with China climate policy experts to discuss their assessments of what the NDC means for China’s emissions pathway, whether China will issue ambitious climate policies in the future and how it will affect global efforts to accelerate the energy transition. The webinar was moderated by Carbon Brief’s deputy editor and senior policy editor Simon Evans and featured:&nbsp;&nbsp; Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst and co-founder at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air Ryna Cui, associate director and associate research professor at the University of Maryland Center for Global Sustainability Anika Patel, Carbon Brief’s China analyst Q&amp;A: What does China’s new Paris Agreement pledge mean for climate action?
