Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceThe slow and complex formation of zeolites, microporous materials central to catalysis and separations, has puzzled researchers for decades. Here, we uncover that the slow formation of zeolites originates in slow dynamics of rearrangement of ...
