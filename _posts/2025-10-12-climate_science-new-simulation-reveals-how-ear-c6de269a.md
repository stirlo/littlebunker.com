Geophysicists have modeled how Earth’s magnetic field could form even when its core was fully liquid. By removing the effects of viscosity in their simulation, they revealed a self-sustaining dynamo that mirrors today’s mechanism. The results illuminate Earth’s early history, life’s origins, and the magnetism of other planets. Plus, it could help forecast future changes to our planet’s protective shield.
