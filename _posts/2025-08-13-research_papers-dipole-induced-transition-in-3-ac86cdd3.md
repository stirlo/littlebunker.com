Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 32, August 2025. SignificanceTopological phase transitions are of great interest in the context of two-dimensional systems, with the Kosterlitzâ€“Thouless and the Hexatic transitions among the best known. These and other dipole (vortex, dislocation)-induced transitions are ...
