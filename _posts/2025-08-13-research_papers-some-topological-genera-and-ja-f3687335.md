Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 32, August 2025. SignificanceThe problem of determining a genus, the cobordism invariants of classes of manifolds, is central in algebraic and differential topology, and mathematical physics. We elucidate three historically significant examples, by obtaining exact ...
