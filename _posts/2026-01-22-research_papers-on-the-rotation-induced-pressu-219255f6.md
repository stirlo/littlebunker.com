Abstract Rotation is a fundamental feature of many weather systems. The pressure‐strain correlation plays an important role in the Reynolds stress budget. However, the behavior of the pressure‐strain correlation under rotation remains insufficiently explored. This study develops a closure model for the rotation‐induced pressure‐strain correlation. In rotating boundary layers, quasi two‐dimensional turbulent eddies are identified as key contributors to modulating the magnitude of the pressure‐strain correlation. By involving the anisotropic characteristics of these eddies, the proposed model represents the rotation‐induced pressure‐strain correlation as a function of the turbulence Rossby number and the Reynolds stresses. Direct numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the closure model. The results show that our closure model is in good agreement with direct numerical simulations. These findings provide valuable insights for improving the representation of rotating boundary layers in weather and climate models.
