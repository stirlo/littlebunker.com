Abstract Mesopause‐region (∼ ${\\sim} $87 km) gravity waves (GWs) generated by tropical convection are investigated within the four longitude sectors encompassing Africa, the Indian Ocean, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and South America during the Dec 2023–Feb 2024 Southern Hemisphere monsoon season. Variances (Qv ${\\mathrm{Q}}_{v}$) in the OH Q‐line emission measured by the Atmospheric Waves Experiment (AWE) capture GW activity, and precipitation rates (PR) from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission identify regions of convective activity. The zonal component of GWs comprising the Qv ${\\mathrm{Q}}_{v}$ between 10° ${}^{\\circ}$S‐10° ${}^{\\circ}$N primarily propagate eastward. The Qv ${\\mathrm{Q}}_{v}$ distributions are latitudinally shifted and more confined in local solar time (LST) compared with those of PR. Mesospheric winds (including tides) appear to induce the latitude‐longitude‐LST variability seen in Qv ${\\mathrm{Q}}_{v}$ through critical‐level filtering and Doppler‐shifting of the GWs. These new insights into the variability of the GW spectrum entering the ionosphere‐thermosphere system further our understanding of the dynamical connections between tropospheric and space weather.
