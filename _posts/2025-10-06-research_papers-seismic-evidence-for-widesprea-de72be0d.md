Abstract Marie Byrd Land is a volcanically active province that overlaps with the Amundsen Sea Embayment, a region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that is experiencing particularly rapid ice mass loss. We locate 34 previously undetected seismic events (ML 1.2–3.2) and identify 251 additional similar events from 2019 to 2024 in eastern Marie Byrd Land. Located at crustal depths and of magmatic or tectonic origin, these events significantly expand the known geographic extent of such seismicity in West Antarctica. Seismicity is primarily located at Mount Takahe, ∼25 km south of the Crary Mountains, and ∼50 km west of the Kohler Range. Long‐period earthquakes at Mount Takahe have seismic characteristics consistent with active magmatic transport at crustal depths beneath the volcano. Glacio‐volcanic feedback due to ongoing ice mass loss may increase eruption frequency from active Marie Byrd Land volcanic systems, possibly perturbing future ice mass loss rates.
