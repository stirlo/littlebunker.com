Abstract Earthquake source spectra provide unique insights into the earthquake rupture process. Motivated by previous research suggesting that complex fault geometries enhance high‐frequency seismic radiation, we study the influence of fault network geometry on earthquake source spectra using multiple independent observations. At regional scales, we examine correlations of stress drop measurements with surface fault trace misalignment in Southern California, Japan, and Central Italy. At a global scale, we examine correlations of moment‐rate function complexity of large earthquakes with focal mechanism variability, a proxy for local fault complexity. Despite significant scatter in the observations, we find overall consistent positive correlations. The concept that elastic interactions of discrete fault structures during the earthquake rupture process generates high‐frequency ground motions offers a coherent framework for interpreting our observations. These findings suggest that variations in fault complexity explain why some earthquakes produce stronger high‐frequency ground motions than others.
