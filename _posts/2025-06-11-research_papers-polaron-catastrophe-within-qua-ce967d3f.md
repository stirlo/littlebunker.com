Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 23, June 2025. SignificanceUnderstanding how electrons interact with lattice vibrations is essential for exploring the properties of exotic materials. Embracing the neglected wave nature of lattice vibrations, we reveal the rich physics hidden from the perturbative ...
