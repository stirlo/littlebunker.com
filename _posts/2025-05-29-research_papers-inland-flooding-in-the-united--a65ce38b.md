Inland flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging natural disasters in the United States. Recent studies in the literature suggest that climate change will likely lead to an increase in the severity and frequency of inland flooding events in the U.S. We review the diverse literature on inland flooding to synthesize the current state of knowledge and to identify knowledge gaps. The topics covered include flood risk perception, insurance uptake, impact on property values, public mitigation strategies, behavioral responses to flooding, fatalities, and damages. We identify important gaps in the literature related to flood insurance demand, adoption of policies that encourage private and public investment in flood management, and flood risk management impacts in disadvantaged communities. Future research should identify factors that have decreased flood-related fatalities over time. Disentangling how infrastructure investments and better flood information improve outcomes during and after a flood could generate more effective tools and policies for mitigating damage from inland floods. Finally, creating and publishing comprehensive datasets that integrate economic, flood, and policy variables over space and time would facilitate future research on the economics of inland flooding. Our findings point to specific future research opportunities that would improve available databases, inform flood risk management strategies, and ultimately reduce the costs of inland floods.
