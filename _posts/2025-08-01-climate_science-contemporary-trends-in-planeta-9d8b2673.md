Nature Climate Change, Published online: 01 August 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02390-2Terrestrial and marine photosynthetic production are typically studied separately. Now, an integrated analysis of land and ocean net primary production for 2003â€“2021 reveals that land and ocean net primary production show contrasting trends. Enhanced biospheric primary production is predominantly driven by an increase over land, partially offset by an oceanic decrease.
