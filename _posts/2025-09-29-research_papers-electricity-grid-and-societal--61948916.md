The electricity grid is a pivotal element in the energy transition, serving as the backbone for integrating and distributing renewable energy. However, amid rapid digitalisation and decentralisation of energy systems, its limitations have become increasingly apparent, posing significant challenges for inclusive and equitable stakeholder engagement in the transition. Stakeholders including consumers, prosumers, energy communities, aggregators and electricity utilities, face unequal distribution of grid-related costs and benefits. There is thus a need to understand and address coupled grid-societal vulnerability (GSV). However, there is still no comprehensive study identifying factors influencing GSV and the corresponding challenges vis-Ã -vis stakeholders. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the disparities in access to hosting capacities for new renewable energy projects and grid congestion due to increased energy demand from households and businesses. We contribute to the literature by developing a comprehensive view of GSV through a systematic literature review of 185 peer-reviewed academic papers focusing on the European context. Three main factors influencing GSV are identified: grid constraints, cybersecurity risks, and regulatory barriers. A complex interrelationship exists between stakeholders in the electricity grid and, as a result, we find there are (in)direct implications of their grid challenges across stakeholders. Therefore, tackling GSV and inequalities in the energy transition requires an integrated solutions approach combining supportive policies, regulatory frameworks and market-based mechanisms with technological integration, innovations and consumer engagement.
