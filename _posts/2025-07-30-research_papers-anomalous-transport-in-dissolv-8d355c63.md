Abstract Mineral dissolution is a fundamental geologic process that alters pore structures, significantly impacting fluid flow and solute transport in porous media. Depending on the interplay between advection, diffusion, and reaction rates, mineral dissolution produces distinct dissolution patterns, such as wormholing and uniform dissolution. These structural changes directly influence the flow field, which in turn controls solute transport behavior. In this study, we conducted pore network modeling to investigate the effects of initial pore network heterogeneity and dissolution regimes on solute transport dynamics. Wormholing enhances network heterogeneity by creating preferential flow paths and stagnation zones, resulting in a transition from Fickian to non‐Fickian transport. In contrast, uniform dissolution homogenizes the pore network and the flow field, driving a transition from non‐Fickian to Fickian transport, even in networks with high initial heterogeneity. These transitions are governed by initial network heterogeneity and the Damköhler number.
