Eight inaugural countries already committed to challengeNice, France (June 9, 2025) - Today at the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC), Brazil and France launched a landmark international initiative to dramatically scale up ocean-focused climate action. The Blue NDC Challenge calls on all countries to place the ocean at the heart of their climate plans (Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) ahead of COP30 which Brazil will host in November.Alongside Brazil and France, an inaugural group of eight countries including Australia, Fiji, Kenya, Mexico, Palau, and the Republic of Seychelles, has already joined the initiative, committing to include the ocean in their updated climate plans under the Paris Agreement. These plans represent the centerpiece of each country’s efforts to reduce emissions and limit warming to 1.5°C and build resilience, and represent the highest level of political will under the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC).Launched today, and building on the momentum this year brings as countries prepare to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, the Blue NDC Challenge underscores the urgent need to recognise the ocean’s central role in addressing the climate crisis as a key ally. The initiative is supported by Ocean Conservancy, the Ocean &amp; Climate Platform, and the World Resources Institute through the Ocean Resilience and Climate Alliance (ORCA) and has been endorsed by WWF-Brazil.In addition to its forests, Brazil is also an oceanic nation, with 40% of its territory located at sea and hosting marine ecosystems of global significance — including the only coral reefs in the South Atlantic and the world's largest contiguous mangrove belt along the Amazon coast. These ecosystems play a vital role in both climate adaptation and mitigation, serving as natural buffers against extreme weather events and contributing to carbon storage.“For Brazil, the Blue NDC Challenge represents a key opportunity to strengthen ocean-related climate action and to emphasize the essential role of ocean-based solutions in achieving emission reduction targets. Through this initiative Brazil seeks to advance international cooperation on ocean climate action in the lead-up to COP30, and to underscore the need for all countries to fully integrate the ocean into their national climate strategies,” said Marina Silva, Brazil Minister for the Environment and Climate Change.“In its recently submitted NDC, Brazil has explicitly included, for the first time, ocean-based climate actions, recognizing the ocean’s critical role in climate regulation. These include the implementation of national Marine Spatial Planning, the enhancement of coastal zone management, and the establishment of programs for the conservation and restoration of mangroves and coral reefs,” she noted.Governments joining the Blue NDCs Challenge commit to stepping up efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience through ocean-based solutions, while also delivering benefits for both nature and people. Depending on their national context, participating countries may include actions such as:Sustainably managing, conserving, and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems - including through marine spatial planning, integrated coastal zone management, and climate-smart marine protected areas;Phasing out offshore oil and gas production and expanding clean ocean energy, such as offshore wind, wave, and tidal power - supported by innovation and technology transfer;Cutting emissions and strengthening resilience in maritime sectors, including shipping and seafood value chains;Supporting sustainable, climate-resilient fisheries and aquaculture to ensure long-term ocean health and food security.Governments that join the Challenge will receive support from a wide range of partners and initiatives, including the Ocean Breakthroughs led by the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, the UN High-Level Climate Champions, and the NDC Partnership hosted by World Resources Institute. Together, they aim to boost investment and action in ocean-based solutions to help achieve a net-zero, resilient, and nature-positive future by 2050.“Ultimately, industrial marine sectors and natural ecosystems are underused tools in addressing climate change and other development needs. As world leaders gather in Nice and prepare for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Belém (COP30), they can take inspiration from the Seychelles in championing ocean-based climate action,” said Wavel Ramkalawan is President of the Republic of Seychelles.“We are pleased to join the Blue NDC Challenge and work alongside COP30 host, Brazil, as well as France, Fiji, the Republic of Seychelles, Mexico, Palau to highlight the vital role of the ocean in global efforts on climate change,” said Senator Murray Watt, Australian Minister for the Environment.“This is an important initiative, and we commend France and Pacific countries in their longstanding leadership on this issue. There are significant opportunities in sustainably managing, conserving and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems, among other blue solutions. We acknowledge the links being drawn between the Paris Agreement and the ocean program this year, as we approach a decade of the Paris Agreement.”Quotes from supporting and endorsing NGOs:“The ocean already plays a vital role in stabilizing our climate–but it has vast untapped potential to be an even greater part of the solution. From harnessing clean energy like offshore wind to restoring marine ecosystems that store vast amounts of carbon, there are many ways that countries can use ocean-climate solutions to deliver on the Paris Agreement,” said Janis Searles Jones, CEO of Ocean Conservancy. \"I thank Brazil for their leadership on the road to COP30. Thank you for launching this Challenge to solidify ocean-based climate solutions as a key part of national climate plans--and to get the resources and assistance needed to make them a reality.\"“Ocean-based climate solutions can deliver up to 35% of the emissions reductions needed to keep 1.5°C within reach. But we are running out of time to maximise the ocean’s potential. That’s why countries must place the ocean at the heart of their climate strategies. We applaud Brazil’s leadership in launching the Blue NDC Challenge, this is a vital step to mobilize ambition, support, and coordination to fully integrate the ocean into national climate plans,” said Tom Pickerell, Global Director of the Ocean Program at World Resources Institute and Head of the Secretariat for the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.“The Paris Agreement was the beginning – a promise that ambition would grow over time. Ten years on, the time for promises is now over. The Blue NDC Challenge is how we turn Paris ambition into Belém action, by fully leveraging ocean-based climate action,” said Loreley Picourt, Executive Director, Ocean &amp; Climate Platform.“As the host of the next climate conference, Brazil has a unique opportunity to lead by example with an ambitious, science- and nature-based agenda that amplifies the voices of vulnerable communities. Including the ocean in national commitments — and ensuring their implementation — is essential to addressing the climate crisis with the urgency it demands. We see the Blue NDC challenge, and Brazil’s leadership, as crucial steps toward more effective, integrated, and resilient climate solutions,” said Marina Corrêa, Oceans Lead at WWF-Brazil.&nbsp;
