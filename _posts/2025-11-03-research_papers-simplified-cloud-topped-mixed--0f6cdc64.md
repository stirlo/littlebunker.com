Abstract Inconsistent findings in soil moisture (SM)‐precipitation feedback literature motivate further research into the role of the boundary layer in these feedbacks. The present study explores mechanisms that can explain the spatial patterns found in a previous analysis employing satellite measured SM: positive feedback in the semi‐arid western U.S. (higher morning SM predicting greater likelihood of afternoon rainfall), and negative feedback in the humid east. Using a cloud–topped boundary layer model, we examine how evaporative fraction (EF, a proxy for SM) influences cloud mass flux (CMF). We then use logistic regression to relate CMF to precipitation. The results are consistent with the previous analysis: in semi‐arid areas, increased humidification with increased EF dominates CMF strength, yielding net positive feedbacks; in humid areas, reductions in convective velocity with increasing EF dominate the CMF, yielding net negative feedbacks. Such offsetting feedbacks may contribute to inconsistencies reported in the literature.
