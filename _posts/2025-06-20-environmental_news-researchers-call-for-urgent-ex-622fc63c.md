Ideas include injecting sulphates into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight but this could do more harm than goodIt is already obvious that some governments are not acting fast enough to keep the planet’s temperature from rising dangerously. While it is essential to continue to concentrate on reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions as quickly as possible, other methods of cooling the planet need to be urgently explored, according to academics at the University of Cambridge’s engineering department.One of the problems is that many of the ideas put forward so far, including injecting sulphates into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space, could do more harm than good. This is because sulphates cause acid rain and interfere with rainfall patterns. Continue reading...
