Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 38, September 2025. SignificanceEnergetic optimization of finite-time processes is of great theoretical and practical relevance, from small-scale engines and robotics to molecular biology and information processing. To move beyond optimal equilibrium-to-equilibrium ...
