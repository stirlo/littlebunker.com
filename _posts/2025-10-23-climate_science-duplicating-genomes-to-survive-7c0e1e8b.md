Nature Climate Change, Published online: 23 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02454-3Marine diatoms, tiny algae that underpin ocean food webs, face rising ocean temperatures. Now, a study shows that genome duplication helps diatoms adapt faster to warming, reshaping our understanding of phytoplankton resilience in a changing ocean.
