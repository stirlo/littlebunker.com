Hybrid species draws up water during heatwaves, producing cooling effect on surroundings, say scientistsPlane trees were originally planted in cities because of their resistance to pollution, disease, compacted soils and the harsh environment. Now researchers have discovered they have another quality: keeping people cool in heatwaves.Swiss scientists found that plane trees do not, as previously believed, close their leaf pores and “shut down” when the temperature reaches 30C to 35C. Instead, the hotter it gets, the more water the trees pump up from underground. As this water evaporates from their leaves, the more the surroundings are cooled. Continue reading...
