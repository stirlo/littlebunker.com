Abstract Metallic ions deposited in the Earth's atmosphere by meteoric ablation primarily occur below 105 km altitude, and sometimes could ascend to the F region altitude ∼200 km under geomagnetic quiet conditions. With the Mohe (122.3°E, 53.5°N, magnetic latitude 54.8°) lidar, we present the first observation of Ca+ layer upwelling from E to F region up to ∼350 km altitude over high middle latitude during the strong magnetic storm on 5 November 2023. The Ca+ layer upwelling process was observed associated with strong equatorward neutral wind. The variations of auroral electrojet index, equatorward neutral wind and Ca+ density profile exhibited close correlations, indicating possible driving source from the polar regions. It is suggested that the equatorward neutral wind enhanced by storm‐time energy input at polar regions could transport the Ca+ upward along the tilted magnetic field lines to F region altitudes over middle latitudes.
