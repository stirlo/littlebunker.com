Abstract China's implementation of stringent emission control measures during 2014–2020 has effectively reduced filterable particulate matter (FPM) emissions from stationary combustion sources, while increasing the contribution of condensable particulate matter (CPM) to total PM emissions. However, the lack of CPM emission inventories hinders the assessment of atmospheric impacts. This study developed a CPM emission inventory for China using field measurements from 148 typical industrial plants/processes. CPM's contribution to total PM emissions from stationary combustion sources had surged from 48.5% to 59.9% during 2014–2020, and will reach approximately 76% by 2030 under current emission control strategies in China. Furthermore, CPM constituted 14.5 ± 8.5% of ambient PM2.5 concentrations during January 2019 in China. Within this CPM contribution, 21.8% was contributed by sulfate/ammonium from coal combustion and ammonia slip in air pollution control devices. These findings call for establishing CPM‐specific emission standards and curbing ammonia slip for further improvements in air quality.
