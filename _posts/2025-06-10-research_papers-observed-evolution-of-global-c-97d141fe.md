This study introduces a novel dynamical climate change hotspot index standard Euclidean distance, capturing variations in temperature and precipitation through average, variability, and extreme values, and utilizes ensemble empirical mode decomposition to analyze nonlinear long-term trends globally. Results highlight pronounced regional disparities, with regions like the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, and the Arabian Peninsula emerging as persistent hotspots due to rapid warming responses. In contrast, the southeastern United States exhibits early-stage declines, though vulnerability to extreme weather is growing. A latitude-time analysis reveals asymmetric hemispheric trajectories, driven by distinct climate dynamics and anthropogenic influences. The transition from systemic temperature-influenced hotspots to localized, extreme event-influenced phenomena underscores the intensifying impact of extreme climate events. These findings provide critical insights into the spatial and temporal evolution of climate change impacts and highlight the necessity of region-specific adaptation strategies.
