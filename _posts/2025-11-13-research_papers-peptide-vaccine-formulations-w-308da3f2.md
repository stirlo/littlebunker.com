Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 45, November 2025. SignificanceThe efficacy of cancer peptide vaccines can be boosted by coadministration with adjuvants, such as Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) agonists. We combined our peptide antigen delivery platform virus-inspired polymers for endosomal release ...
