Over 300 million years ago, Earth experienced powerful bursts of carbon dioxide from natural sources—like massive volcanic eruptions—that triggered dramatic drops in ocean oxygen levels. These ancient \"carbon burps\" led to dangerous periods of ocean anoxia, which stalled marine biodiversity and potentially reshaped entire ecosystems. In a groundbreaking study, scientists combined high-tech climate models with deep-ocean sediment analysis to pinpoint five such events. The alarming part? Today's human-driven CO₂ emissions are skyrocketing at speeds hundreds of times faster than those ancient upheavals—raising urgent questions about how modern oceans, particularly coastal zones rich in marine life, might react.
