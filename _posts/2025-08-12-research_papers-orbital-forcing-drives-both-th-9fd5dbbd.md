Abstract South American summer monsoon (SASM) strength tracks insolation on orbital timescales, linking global climate and continental hydrology. However, whether local water availability also responds to global climate forcings is unclear. Here, we present water balance records from Lake Junín, an Andean lake within the SASM domain. Local water balance and SASM strength is inferred from triple oxygen isotopes of lake carbonates during two interglacial periods (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 15, 621–563 ka; the Holocene, 11.7–0 ka). We find SASM strength and water balance both follow the precession‐pacing of local summer insolation, with the driest conditions occurring at Lake Junín under weakened SASM conditions (and vice versa). Further, the largest variations occurred during MIS 15, when insolation was more variable than the Holocene. These results suggest that global climate influences South American hydrology on both the local and continental scales, with implications for tropical water resources, the atmospheric greenhouse effect, and ecosystem dynamics.
