Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 43, October 2025. SignificanceWe present isotopic measurements of mineral-bound water from rocks sampled by the Curiosity rover. These hydrous mineralsâ€™ strong18O enrichments stand apart from prior observations of ancient martian water reservoirs. Extreme deuterium ...
