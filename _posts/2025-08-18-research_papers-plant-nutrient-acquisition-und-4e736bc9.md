Nature Climate Change, Published online: 18 August 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02386-yElevated atmospheric CO2 has stimulated plant growth, yet the future land carbon sink may be constrained in part by nutrient availability. Here the authors review plant nutrient acquisition strategies and the need for better representation in models to improve predictions of land carbon uptake.
