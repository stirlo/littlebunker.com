Abstract North China frequently experiences devastating extreme precipitation events (EPEs). Upstream spatiotemporal propagation characteristics of EPEs can provide useful precursors for forecasting North China EPEs but remains poorly understood. Using climate network analysis, two dominant EPEs propagation pathways, that is, a northwestern pathway from West Siberian Plain (6‐day lead) and a southwestern pathway from Tibetan Plateau (TP) (3‐day lead), are identified during the warm season. The northwestern pathway is driven by an eastward‐propagating mid‐latitude wave train coupled with Arctic cyclone. The cyclone in the wave train drives the southeastward‐propagating EPEs, and when it merges with the Arctic cyclone, its downstream anticyclone is enhanced, ultimately inducing North China EPEs. The southwestern pathway stems from quasi‐stationary waves coupled with Arctic anticyclone. Interactions between anticyclone in the wave train and Arctic anticyclone generate a TP cyclone, whose intensification and eastward expansion propel EPEs northeastward and strengthen the Northeast Asian anticyclone, ultimately causing North China EPEs.
