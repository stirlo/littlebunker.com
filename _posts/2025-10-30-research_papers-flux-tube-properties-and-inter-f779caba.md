Abstract In Jupiter's magnetosphere, the outward transport of Io‐genic plasma and the planetward injection of energetic particles are facilitated by flux tube interchange motion driven by centrifugal instabilities. Flux tube content and entropy are two competing key quantities that determine the behavior of the system. In this study, we first review the centrifugal force driven dynamics in different regions. Benefiting from Juno's high‐quality in situ data in the off‐equatorial region, we then analyze the flux tube integrals and interchange instability criteria between M‐shells 13 and 40 using numerical integration. On average, the entropy term dominates the system, resulting in a generally stable system for interchange motion. Finally, we investigate an injection event, in which predictions from the criteria align with the observed flow direction. This study illustrates the overall stability of the system with small‐scale, intermittent dynamic phenomena.
