Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 34, August 2025. SignificanceThis study is significant because it provides crucial insights into how global warming affects plant biomass, which is a key factor in carbon sequestration. Understanding the diminishing long-term biomass responses to rising temperatures is ...
