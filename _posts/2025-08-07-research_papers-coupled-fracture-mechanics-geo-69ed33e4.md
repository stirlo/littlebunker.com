Abstract Reaction‐driven cracking has been discussed for decades. One mechanism is the extension of a microcrack resulting from precipitation. This mechanism can create porosity, permeability and reactive surface area in low‐permeability rock. We model this problem as a fracture loaded over a fraction of its length by a vein. The loading causes crack propagation when the stress intensity factor reaches its critical value. We calculate the conditions for the onset of crack growth, the time required, pressure distribution around the vein, and the crack surface displacements. These results are relevant to many problems. One application is to geological storage of CO2 ${\\text{CO}}_{2}$ by mineralization. Results depend strongly on rock parameters but using representative values from experiments, our calculations suggest an initiation time within tens of years at low temperature and dilute fluid conditions. Lower critical stress intensity factor, higher reaction rate, and greater carbonate filling ratio reduce the time to initiation.
