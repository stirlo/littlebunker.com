Nature Climate Change, Published online: 07 August 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02373-3The decarbonization of energy systems requires access to minerals that are critical for manufacturing low-carbon technologies. Here researchers show that meeting climate targets could be impeded by material shortages, revealing the importance of diverse solutions that balance mitigation, equity and resource constraints.
