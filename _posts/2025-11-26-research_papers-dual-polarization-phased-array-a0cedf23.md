Abstract Quasi‐linear convective system (QLCS) mesovortices produce a non‐trivial fraction of tornadoes across the United States each year. Tornadoes from QLCS mesovortices evolve rapidly on time scales less than that observed by conventional weather radars. In this study, a well‐calibrated, dual‐polarization phased array radar (PAR) is used to examine three tornadic mesovortices in the 27 February 2023 QLCS in central Oklahoma, with rapid volumetric scanning strategies that included dense elevation angles. Through examining dual‐polarization profiles and three‐dimensional wind estimates around the mesovortices, we show that the mesovortices examined were associated with (a) downdrafts prior to tornadogenesis, (b) increased convergence along the QLCS gust front ahead of the downdrafts, and (c) dual‐polarization profiles that suggest evaporation and precipitation drove the downdrafts. This study represents the first time a dual‐polarization PAR has been used to document tornadic QLCS mesovortices.
