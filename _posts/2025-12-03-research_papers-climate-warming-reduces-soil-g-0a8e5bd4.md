Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 48, December 2025. SignificanceClimate models project that under future warming scenarios, ecosystems will lose nitrogen (N) because of accelerated cycling and increased gaseous N losses. However, these projections are predominantly derived from laboratory experiments that ...
