Abstract Southern Ocean eddies showcase complexity from both Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints, with the latter being more intricate largely due to the advection of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Through investigating the altimeter‐identified characteristics of the mesoscale eddy kinematic properties within the ACC axis, this study indicates that the eddies in the Southern Ocean are highly energetic with large kinematic properties, including amplitude, radius, and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Notably, the derived interior EKE within the eddy boundary (EKElo) shows an increase, that is, an order of magnitude greater in the Lagrangian framework compared to the Eulerian one. The strong Lagrangian variations likely arise from the rapid intensification of eddy energy influenced by the mixing and dissipation dominated by ACC fronts. These findings advance our understanding of the intricate dynamics of ocean eddies and ocean energy forward cascades in the Southern Ocean.
