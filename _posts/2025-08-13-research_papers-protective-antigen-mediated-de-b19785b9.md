Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 32, August 2025. SignificanceThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the first CRISPR-Cas9 therapy, making genome editing a promising strategy for treating genetic disorders ex vivo and in vivo. Unintended or off-target genome editing increases with the ...
