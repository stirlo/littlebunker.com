As the federal government escalates its assault on unhoused communities, President Trump issues an inhumane executive order pressuring local governments to forcibly remove people experiencing homelessness from the streets. This order doesn’t offer care–it criminalizes survival. We unequivocally reject this cruel approach and affirm that housing justice and climate justice are inseparable. Housing insecurity exacerbates the harms of the climate crisis. Low-income communities–especially Indigenous, Black, Latinx, Asian American, and Pacific Islander, and poor white neighborhoods—are hit first and worst by climate impacts and frequently face housing instability, displacement, and unsafe living conditions. The reality is that housing is a frontline defense against climate chaos, and secure, healthy homes are essential for building community resilience. Rather than investing in permanent, supportive housing and robust public health solutions, this executive order aims to remove people from public view through coercion and criminalization. That will do nothing to address the housing insecurity crisis that nearly 40 million people in the U.S. face&#8211;many of whom are rent- or mortgage-burdened, living paycheck to paycheck, or enduring unsafe housing riddled with mold, lead, and decay. Meanwhile, land speculation, gentrification, and extractive development continue to displace communities across the country, especially on Indigenous lands and in climate-vulnerable areas. Housing must not be commodified–it is a human right. Everyone deserves a safe, affordable, climate-resilient place to call home. We call on local and federal leaders to reject these dehumanizing tactics and instead embrace real, just, and long-term solutions—from rent stabilization and housing retrofits to climate-resilient infrastructure and land-back policies.
