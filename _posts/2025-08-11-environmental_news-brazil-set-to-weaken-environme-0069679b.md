Green activists have warned that changes made by Brazil’s president to a bill that would allow the government to push through energy and infrastructure projects are not strong enough to fully protect its environment, forests and local communities. On the last day for him to take a decision on what environmental campaigners have dubbed the ‘devastation bill’, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vetoed 63 of the text&#8217;s nearly 400 provisions, while giving a green light to the rest. Approved by Congress on July 17, the bill proposes streamlining environmental licensing in the country.&nbsp; In an official statement, the government said Lula’s vetoes would ensure “environmental protection and legal certainty”, including for investors. Marina Silva, Brazil’s minister of environment and climate change, described the outcome as “the result of a major effort to achieve greater efficiency without sacrificing quality in the licensing process”.&nbsp; Ana Carolina Crisostomo, a conservation specialist with WWF-Brazil, said the vetoes “were a response to society’s outcry, which mobilised broadly against the text of the bill approved by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.” Aug 7, 2025 News Amazon fires threaten initiatives to raise cash for rainforest protection Brazil’s Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) and other innovative finance tools will be showcased at COP30, but surging wildfires in the Amazon pose a threat to their success, climate experts warn Read more Aug 7, 2025 Politics Oil states accused of using scare tactics in bid to sink green shipping deal Saudi Arabia, Iran and other oil-reliant countries are campaigning to stop the adoption of the IMO&#8217;s Net-zero Framework in October Read more Aug 8, 2025 Politics As US joins oil states in blocking production cuts, UN plastics treaty talks remain deadlocked As negotiations near the mid-way point, no agreement is in sight amid opposition to measures on production from the US, Gulf states, Russia and India Read more “Erosion” of environmental oversight Environmentalists welcomed Lula’s veto of provisions in the bill that would have restricted consultation on projects with agencies responsible for protecting Indigenous and traditional communities, as well as the removal of the special protection regime for the Atlantic Forest. However two provisions that weakened the process were approved with alterations: a system to allow some projects to issue their own licences, called Environmental License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), and a Special Environmental License (LAE) to fast track “strategic projects.” “While some blatantly unacceptable provisions got vetoed, others that were just as bad advanced, putting the government&#8217;s interests ahead of the environment,” Lucas Kannoa, head of legal affairs at the Arayara International Institute, told Climate Home News. “The main impact is a significant erosion of oversight and control procedures.” The institute has mapped at least 2,600 fossil fuel projects that could gain accelerated approval under the new LAE.&nbsp; “For the first time, environmental licensing will be conducted under a purely political logic,” Arayara said in a statement. It called the partial rubber-stamping of the LAE a “victory of the lobbying efforts of national and foreign oil and large mining companies.” Brazilian indigenous women marching against the &#8220;devastation bill&#8221; in Brasilia on Thursday August 7, adding pressure for president Lula da Silva to veto the bill.

In the original text of the bill approved by Congress, the LAC self-licensing process would have exempted low and medium-impact projects from having to win approval from environmental agencies, provided the companies completed an online declaration of compliance with the rules. Lula’s veto has restricted this option to low-impact projects only, which observers interpret as road paving, infrastructure upkeep and hydroelectric plants, among other examples. “That does some damage control,” Mauricio Angelo, executive director of the Mining Observatory, told Climate Home News.&nbsp;&nbsp; A different regime called the LAE, which applies for projects considered “strategic” by a political council, came into effect immediately via executive order. Projects under this scheme could access a simplified and expedited licensing, which does not require climate change or other risks to be taken into account. “Anything can be deemed strategic for the government: mining operations, hydroelectric plants, paving new roads in the Amazon – their interest will bypass any social or environmental concerns,” warned Angelo of the Climate Observatory.

That hinders Brazil&#8217;s plans to reach zero deforestation by 2030, a key goal in the country’s climate action plan, observers said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lula&#8217;s vetoes, as well as his Executive Order, must still be ratified by Congress. Kannoa noted that there could be a prior agreement between the Lula and Congress, potentially allowing these measures to be quickly accepted in order to expedite overall progress on the bill. Environmentalists are concerned that Brazil is tarnishing its reputation ahead of the COP30 climate summit it will host in November with recent moves such as the environmental licensing bill and auctioning of oil and gas exploration blocks. “It is a tragedy that in the same year that Brazil is hosting COP30, Congress decides to roll back environmental norms and the president does too little to veto,”&nbsp; Kannoa said.&nbsp; Claudio Angelo said Brazil had already damaged its reputation on the global stage ahead of the COP30 climate summit due to growing complaints about insufficient and expensive accommodation in the Amazon city of Belem where the UN talks are due to be held.&nbsp; He added that Lula’s vetoes on the environmental licensing bill and the resulting process for approving projects are “so confusing that we can barely tell if it&#8217;s good or bad news”.
