Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 32, August 2025. SignificanceWe introduce a theory to describe strong light–matter interactions between electrons in a crystal and the spatially confined electromagnetic (EM) fields of a “subwavelength” cavity. In these cavities, polaritons (i.e., hybrid quasiparticles ...
