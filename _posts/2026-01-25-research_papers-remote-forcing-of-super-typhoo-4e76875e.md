Abstract Typhoons and wildfires are major global climate and environmental hazards, yet their potential interactions remain poorly understood, particularly through remote atmospheric forcing. Taking the 2023 Quebec wildfires as an example, we investigate how a tropical cyclone can influence wildfire‐favorable conditions. Observational analyses and Linear Baroclinic Model simulations reveal that western North Pacific Super Typhoon Mawar remotely intensified a North American blocking high by triggering a Rossby wave train, thereby driving dry lightning and anomalous dry air conditions that favored wildfire ignition and spread. Based on Weather Research and Forecasting model sensitivity experiments, we show that Mawar contributed 34 ± 6%, 41 ± 3%, and 55 ± 5% to the blocking's total amplification during the first three days of its rapid development, respectively. This findings highlight that western North Pacific typhoons can remotely modulate blocking highs to drive North American wildfire weather, advancing our understanding of remote typhoon‐wildfire teleconnections.
