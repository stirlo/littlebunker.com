Al-Karim Govindji is the global head of public affairs for&nbsp;energy systems&nbsp;at DNV, an independent assurance and risk management provider, operating in more than 100 countries. Optimism that this year may be less eventful than those that have preceded it have already been dealt a big blow &#8211; and we’re just weeks into 2026. Events in Venezuela, protests in Iran and a potential diplomatic crisis over Greenland all spell a continuation of the unpredictability that has now become the norm. As is so often the case, it is impossible to separate energy and the industry that provides it from the geopolitical incidents shaping the future. Increasingly we hear the phrase ‘the past is a foreign country’, but for those working in oil and gas, offshore wind, and everything in between, this sentiment rings truer every day. More than 10 years on from the signing of the Paris Agreement, the sector and the world around it is unrecognisable. The decade has, to date, been defined by a gritty reality &#8211; geopolitical friction, trade barriers and shifting domestic priorities &#8211; and amidst policy reversals in major economies, it is tempting to conclude that the transition is stalling. Truth, however, is so often found in the numbers &#8211; and DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025 should act as a tonic for those feeling downhearted about the state of play. While the transition is becoming more fragmented and slower than required, it is being propelled by a new, powerful logic found at the intersection between national energy security and unbeatable renewable economics. A diverging global trajectory The transition is no longer a single, uniform movement; rather, we are seeing a widening &#8220;execution gap&#8221; between mature technologies and those still finding their feet. Driven by China’s massive industrial scaling, solar PV, onshore wind and battery storage have reached a price point where they are virtually unstoppable. These variable renewables are projected to account for 32% of global power by 2030, surging to over half of the world&#8217;s electricity by 2040. This shift signals the end of coal and gas dominance, with the fossil fuel share of the power sector expected to collapse from 59% today to just 4% by 2060. Jan 21, 2026 News Climate at Davos: Clean tech powers on despite policy wobbles Al Gore says climate policy may be suffering &#8220;a recession&#8221; in many countries &#8211; but the energy transition continues apace, driven by falling costs for renewables and batteries Read more Jan 20, 2026 Politics Climate at Davos: Energy security in the geopolitical driving seat While climate change is a lower priority for leaders at this year&#8217;s World Economic Forum, control of energy supplies and minerals is a hot topic Read more Conversely, technologies that require heavy subsidies or consistent long-term policy, the likes of hydrogen derivatives (ammonia and methanol), floating wind and carbon capture, are struggling to gain traction. Our forecast for hydrogen’s share in the 2050 energy mix has been downgraded from 4.8% to 3.5% over the last three years, as large-scale commercialisation for these &#8220;hard-to-abate&#8221; solutions is pushed back into the 2040s. Regional friction and the security paradigm Policy volatility remains a significant risk to transition timelines across the globe, most notably in North America. Recently we have seen the US pivot its policy to favour fossil fuel promotion, something that is only likely to increase under the current administration. Invariably this creates measurable drag, with our research suggesting the region will emit 500-1,000 Mt more CO₂ annually through 2050 than previously projected. China, conversely, continues to shatter energy transition records, installing over half of the world’s solar and 60% of its wind capacity. In Europe and Asia, energy policy is increasingly viewed through the lens of sovereignty; renewables are no longer just ‘green’, they are ‘domestic’, ‘indigenous’, ‘homegrown’. They offer a way to reduce reliance on volatile international fuel markets and protect industrial competitiveness. Grids and the AI variable As we move toward a future where electricity’s share of energy demand doubles to 43% by 2060, we are hitting a physical wall, namely the power grid. In Europe, this ‘gridlock’ is already a much-discussed issue and without faster infrastructure expansion, wind and solar deployment will be constrained by 8% and 16% respectively by 2035. Comment: To break its coal habit, China should look to California’s progress on batteries This pressure is compounded by the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI will represent only 3% of global electricity use by 2040, its concentration in North American data centres means it will consume a staggering 12% of the region&#8217;s power demand. This localized hunger for power threatens to slow the retirement of fossil fuel plants as utilities struggle to meet surging base-load requirements. The offshore resurgence Despite recent headlines regarding supply chain inflation and project cancellations, the long-term outlook for offshore energy remains robust. We anticipate a strong resurgence post-2030 as costs stabilise and supply chains mature, positioning offshore wind as a central pillar of energy-secure systems. Governments defend clean energy transition as US snubs renewables agency A new trend is also emerging in behind-the-meter offshore power, where hybrid floating platforms that combine wind and solar will power subsea operations and maritime hubs, effectively bypassing grid bottlenecks while decarbonising oil and gas infrastructure. 2.2C &#8211; a reality check Global CO₂ emissions are finally expected to have peaked in 2025, but the descent will be gradual. On our current path, the 1.5C carbon budget will be exhausted by 2029, leading the world toward 2.2C of warming by the end of the century. Still, the transition is not failing &#8211; but it is changing shape, moving away from a policy-led &#8220;green dream&#8221; toward a market-led &#8220;industrial reality&#8221;. For the ocean and energy sectors, the strategy for the next decade is clear. Scale the technologies that are winning today, aggressively unblock the infrastructure bottlenecks of tomorrow, and plan for a future that will, once again, look wholly different.
