On a speedboat in the Arctic Ocean, a team of scientists are hurtling towards a glacier known as Blomstrandbreen, an 18-km-long river of blue and grey ice.



Blombstrandbreen sits on top of Svalbard, an island located at 79 degrees north in the Arctic Ocean.



The terminus of the glacier directly faces the sea â€“ and, to get close, the boat must navigate car-sized chunks of ice that have recently calved off the glacier.
