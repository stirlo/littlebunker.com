Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 46, November 2025. SignificanceHard decision problems, in computational complexity theory known as NP-complete, are of universal importance. From a conceptual perspective, an efficient solution to one such complete problem is tantamount to solving any other in the wide ...
