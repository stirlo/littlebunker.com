Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 51, December 2025. SignificanceInterneurons are classically viewed as essential components in the maintenance and regulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in local neuronal networks. Nevertheless, recent studies have shed new light on vasoactive intestinal peptide ...
