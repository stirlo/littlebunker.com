Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 27, July 2025. SignificanceQuantum discord is a measure of the quantum correlations that exist between subsystems of a quantum state. Initially defined for two subsystems, it was recently extended to multipartite systems, but has never been experimentally measured. In ...
