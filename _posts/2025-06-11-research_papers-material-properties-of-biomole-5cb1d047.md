Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 23, June 2025. SignificanceCells organize many of their activities within membraneless compartments known as biomolecular condensates. Our research uncovers how the rapid, small-scale motions of disordered proteins within these condensates determine their overall ...
