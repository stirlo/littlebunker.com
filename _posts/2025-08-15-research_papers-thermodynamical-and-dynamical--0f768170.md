Abstract Tibetan Plateau mesoscale convective systems (TP_MCSs) shape regional weather and precipitation, yet their thermodynamical and dynamical background characteristics, and microphysical structures remain poorly understood due to sparse observations. To address this research gap, we integrate a 7‐year TP_MCS database with ERA5 reanalysis and satellite observations to construct vertical profiles, enabling a systematic examination of TP_MCSs' structures. Results reveal distinct stage‐dependent characteristics, with peak convective intensity, the lowest 0°C level, the largest hydrometeor diameters, and maximum rainfall rates during the development stage. TP_MCSs' convection intensity is modulated through coupled thermodynamical (temperature, humidity), dynamical (vertical motion, moisture transport), and microphysical (hydrometeor characteristics) interactions that regulate buoyancy, latent heating, and entrainment processes. Moreover, TP_MCSs' precipitation is governed by competing enhancement (buoyancy, moisture transport) and suppression (dry, cold entrainment) mechanisms. These findings are helpful to improve understanding of TP_MCSs' vertical structure and aid convection parameterization in climate models.
