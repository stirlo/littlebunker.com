Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 22, June 2025. SignificanceWe revealed a mechanism in which a viral protein promotes the direct RIPK3 activation leading to inflammatory necroptosis and pathogenesis. The nonstructural protein NSs of a pathogenic hemorrhagic fever virus, SFTSV, interacts with the RIPK3 ...
