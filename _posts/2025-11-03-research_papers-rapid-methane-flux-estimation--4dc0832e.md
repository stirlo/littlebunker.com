Abstract Rapid estimation of high‐resolution (∼km), regional‐scale (∼104 km2) CH4 fluxes plays a critical role in supporting the Global Methane Pledge and guiding targeted mitigation strategies. This study presents a novel method that combines XCH4 observations from MethaneSAT and Sentinel‐5P to directly estimate CH4 fluxes without relying on chemical transport models (CTMs). We retrieved 5 km‐resolution CH4 fluxes over western and eastern Turkmenistan, with total emissions of 389.3 ± 76.8 t/hr and 168.5 ± 33.8 t/hr, respectively. These estimates agree within ∼13% of standard atmospheric inversions but exceed GFEI and EDGAR inventories by nearly 100%, highlighting the critical role of satellite remote sensing in independently verifying regional‐ to national‐scale CH4 emissions. This approach offers a new pathway for rapidly inferring kilometer‐scale greenhouse gas fluxes from regional, high‐resolution satellite observations such as MethaneSAT, CO2M, and TanSat‐2.
