Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. SignificanceRestoring function after spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a major challenge due to the failure of regenerated connections to reintegrate into functional circuits. Our study demonstrates that while enhancing axon regeneration and neural stem ...
