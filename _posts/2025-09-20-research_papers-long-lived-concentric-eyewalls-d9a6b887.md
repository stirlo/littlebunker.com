Abstract Long‐lived concentric eyewalls (CEs) and short‐lived CEs are accompanied by diverse structural parameters such as intensity (Vmax) and integrated kinetic energy (IKE). This study used a CE data set and an AI‐based tropical cyclone (TC) wind profile reanalysis to examine the impact of CEs on TC evolution revealed by IKE‐Vmax diagrams. AI‐based wind profiles are a fusion of multichannel satellite imagery and ERA5 data, representing 0–750 km profiles of axisymmetric surface winds. The AI‐derived IKE has an R = 0.996 against aircraft observations. Composite results show that short‐lived CEs (duration <20 h) tend to maintain IKE, while long‐lived CEs (25% of all CEs) favor further IKE growth, contributing to TCs with an enormous circulation. It is suggested that CEs may modulate the TC life cycle, evolving from small, intense storms to large, mature storms to large, weak‐intensity storms before their ultimate demise.
