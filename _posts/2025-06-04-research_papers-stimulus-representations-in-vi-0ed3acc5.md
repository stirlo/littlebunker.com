Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 22, June 2025. SignificanceThis study reveals a crucial link between covert spatial attention, object processing, and microsaccades (MSs). While spatial attention alone does not affect tuning curves of V4 neurons, MSs directed toward an attended stimulus significantly ...
