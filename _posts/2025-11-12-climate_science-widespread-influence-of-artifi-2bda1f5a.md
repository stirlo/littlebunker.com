Nature Climate Change, Published online: 12 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02481-0The authors combine light intensity data with eddy covariance observations from 86 sites to show that artificial light at night increases ecosystem respiration and alters carbon exchange, with impacts shaped by diel cycles and seasonal dynamics.
