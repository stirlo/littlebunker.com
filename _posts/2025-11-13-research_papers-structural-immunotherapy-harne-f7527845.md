Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 45, November 2025. Structural immunotherapy relies on the structural features of immunotherapeutics in addition to component identity to influence biodistribution, intra- or extracellular localization, target engagement, and processing kinetics. This strategy is poised to ...
