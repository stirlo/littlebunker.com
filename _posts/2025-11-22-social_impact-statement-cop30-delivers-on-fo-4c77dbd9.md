Belém, Brazil (November 22, 2025) —&nbsp;Today, negotiators concluded COP30 in Belém, Brazil. They reached agreement to triple adaptation finance and to hold a series of dialogues on trade within the UNFCCC for the first time. However, the formal negotiations offered an inadequate response to the shortfall in ambition in national climate commitments, failing to explicitly agree on the roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation that many countries and stakeholders had advocated. The Brazilian COP President launched these roadmaps in its own capacity.&nbsp;Other major highlights from the summit include the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility;&nbsp;major efforts to unite local, regional and national governments around climate action; pledges for Indigenous Peoples and local communities’ finance and land rights; a pledge to quadruple 'sustainable fuels'; and much more.&nbsp;Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President &amp; CEO, World Resources Institute:&nbsp;“COP30 delivered breakthroughs to triple adaptation finance and protect the world’s forests, and it elevated the voices of Indigenous Peoples like never before. This shows that even against a challenging geopolitical backdrop, international climate cooperation can still deliver results.&nbsp;“But many will leave Belém disappointed that negotiators couldn't agree to develop a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels. More than 80 countries stood their ground for a fair and equitable shift off fossil fuels, but intense lobbying from a few petrostates weakened the deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;“At the last minute, negotiators incorporated a reference to a previous agreement on accelerating the climate transition in multiple sectors, and the Brazilian Presidency announced it would create fossil fuel and deforestation roadmaps outside of the formal negotiations. Now it’s up to President Lula and the Brazilian COP presidency to turn that into a strong and inclusive global plan to transition away from fossil fuels.&nbsp;&nbsp;“An equally robust global plan for halting and reversing deforestation is just as essential.&nbsp;“COP30 focused more than ever before on the economic transition. Countries recognized by accelerating climate action they will be rewarded through&nbsp;growth, investment, security, competitiveness and good-paying jobs.&nbsp;Those who sit on the sidelines will be left behind. The just transition outcome underscored that decarbonizing our economies and advancing social and economic development are mutually reinforcing. For the first time in UN climate negotiations, countries agreed to discuss how trade can become a bridge rather than a barrier to climate progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Belém, gateway to the Amazon, was a powerful setting for nature to take center stage ‒ not as a side issue, but as core to climate success. The Tropical Forest Forever Facility has real potential to be a breakthrough for the world’s forests, and now more countries must step up with the finance required to turn promise into progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Despite setbacks in the negotiating halls, many of us will remember Belém as the COP of action. Cities and states stepped up, with 14,000 local governments committing to slash emissions and protect communities from deadly heat. More countries committed to phase-out coal, restore forests, transform food systems and sustainably manage the ocean. Thirteen nations and one region launched ‘country platforms’ to mobilize public and private finance at scale for their climate and development priorities. Utilities serving millions of customers pledged nearly $150 billion for new grids and storage. Major new initiatives were elevated to create green jobs and harmonize carbon accounting, and nearly 120 acceleration plans were unveiled under the COP30 Action Agenda.“The Baku to Belem Roadmap to $1.3 Trillion marked a step change by outlining practical steps to ensure different sources of finance are working together to drive investment at scale. Announcements throughout the week, from risk guarantees to country platforms, showed that these ideas are already moving from concept to implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;“COP30 succeeded in putting people at the center of climate action. Indigenous Peoples participated in record numbers and made their voices heard. The Global Ethical Stocktake affirmed that fairness, inclusion, and responsibility must guide every decision. New commitments for Indigenous Peoples’ and communities’ land rights and finance offer a strong step forward, though far more is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
