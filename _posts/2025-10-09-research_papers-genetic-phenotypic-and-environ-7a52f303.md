Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 40, October 2025. SignificanceAs climate change alters environments, many wild populations are struggling to keep up. However, empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to track environmental change remain rare. Here, we identify genetic and ...
