Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 46, November 2025. SignificanceThe oxidation–reduction behavior of iron under pressure in part controls the chemical processes occurring in the deep Earth. Large-scale first-principles calculations show that iron reverses its redox nature under core pressures, shifting from ...
