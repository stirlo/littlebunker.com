Abstract The first evidence of cross‐shelf transport of organic matter for supporting the carbon demand in the intense oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the northwestern Bay of Bengal (BoB) is reported. The spread of high concentrations of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen with their isotopic composition close to shelf sediments was observed from shelf to offshore in the OMZ between 200 and 700 m, supporting high organic carbon demand. Using the mean current speed at these depths, the organic carbon transported from the shelf is estimated to contribute two‐thirds of the carbon demand in the OMZ. This explains the occurrence of OMZ in the BoB despite low export production. The simulation of OMZ by numerical models may be improved by incorporating cross‐shelf transport of organic matter.
