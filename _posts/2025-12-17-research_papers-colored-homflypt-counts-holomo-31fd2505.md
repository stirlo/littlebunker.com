Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. SignificanceIn 1999, Ooguri and Vafa conjectured a formula connecting two previously unrelated areas: holomorphic curve counting and the study of knot invariants. The former concerns the enumeration of solutions to certain partial differential equations, ...
