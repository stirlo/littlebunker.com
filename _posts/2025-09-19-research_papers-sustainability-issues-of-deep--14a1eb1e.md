Deep-sea mining (DSM) has gained attention due to the growing demand for critical minerals considered to be essential for green energy transitions as well as geopolitical drives to secure their supply. It has become a high-stakes issue involving divergent viewpoints among stakeholders driven by deep uncertainties about socio-environmental impacts. This bibliometric review of DSM highlights the current state of research, identifies gaps, and proposes future research priorities. The review employs a social-ecological-technological systems framework to integrate various aspects of DSM and provides an analysis of trends of research themes from 1994 to 2023. Our findings indicate a significant gap in addressing the social impacts of DSM, particularly on coastal communities and broader societal implications. The results emphasize the need for comprehensive governance policies, technological advancements, and an understanding of ecological and social impacts to enhance community and ecosystem resilience. Such insights offer a guide for future research agendas by highlighting priority areas of investigation and fostering a holistic approach to DSM.
