Abstract This work presents a global distribution of daytime lunar tidal winds at altitudes of 80–115 km based on Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics observation. The lunar tidal wind dynamo currents are then derived using the observed winds for the first time, and its lunar geomagnetic effects are studied. At about 110 km height within latitude of ±50°, the zonal winds are generally symmetrical about equatorial plane, while the meridional winds are antisymmetric. Dynamo currents produced by lunar tidal winds at 90–115 km height well reproduced the equivalent four‐vortex current system deduced from geomagnetic data. The lunar tidal wind pattern aligns with ionospheric currents, indicating its structure between 90 and 115 km significantly shapes lunar geomagnetic tide morphology. This work provides insights about the role of lunar tidal winds in driving geomagnetic lunar tidal variation and other electromagnetic field‐related lunar tides.
