Abstract This study investigates the potential role of isobaric mixing in the formation of marine boundary layer clouds. Cloud formation theory emphasizes uplift and adiabatic cooling, but recent observations support the existence of small clouds forming at various altitudes, even below the lifting condensation level. Isobaric mixing of air with different thermodynamic properties can generate localized supersaturation. A Gaussian mixing model is employed to simulate this process, considering the correlation between temperature and water vapor. Cloud droplet size distributions from aircraft measurements show a persistent and prominent mode of small droplets at 9 μ ${\upmu }$m, and the size of this mode compares favorably with predictions from the model. The results suggests that isobaric mixing plausibly contributes to the formation of clouds, particularly those observed at multiple altitudes with narrow droplet size distributions. This finding highlights the importance of considering isobaric mixing processes in understanding and modeling cloud formation.
