Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 36, September 2025. SignificanceMajor changes in atmospheric O2occurred ~2.4 to 2.0 billion years ago, in part inferred from the distributions of redox-sensitive trace elements in Earthâ€™s surface rocks. Using the long-lived U-Th-Pb decay systems, we demonstrate extensive U4+...
