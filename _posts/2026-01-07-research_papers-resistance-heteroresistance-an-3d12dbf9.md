Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 1, January 2026. SignificanceThe mutational pathways leading to antibiotic-resistant infections and the role of the immune system in preventing them are poorly understood. Here, we employed a colistin-treated mouse pneumonia model ofAcinetobacter baumanniiand observed ...
