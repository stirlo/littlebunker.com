Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) along with 65 other international bodies, treaties, and organizations that lead global cooperation around climate, human rights, security, trade, economics, and international law. This is a disastrous decision that goes against common sense and puts the safety and well-being of future generations at serious risk. We need cooperation and real solutions at home and abroad, not handouts to big corporations that put families, communities and entire nations in harm&#8217;s way. At a time when new technologies like AI are pushing our energy grid to its limits and wreaking havoc— just last year the AI boom caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere as emitted by the whole of New York City— and fossil fuel expansion is underway at all costs through coercion, military might and threats of war, the US must be held to account and brought back to the table. Participating in and abiding by global agreements, treaties, and legal frameworks is the minimum that the Trump Administration should do. If not, we will all pay the price, with increased ramifications for women, Tribal nations, countries outside of the big superpowers, and our planet. Let’s all continue to demand that human rights, democracy, diversity, self-determination, national sovereignty, and equality are respected and continue to be values we all aspire to. Here’s what climate justice leaders are saying: &#8220;Trump&#8217;s withdrawal from international climate institutions is intended to knowingly accelerate climate change by incentivizing polluters at the expense of communities already on the frontlines of climate chaos. This move protects profit, not people &#8211; and it deepens the violence against Black, Brown, Indigenous, and working-class communities worldwide.&#8221; -Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director, UPROSE and CJA Co-Chair “The U.S. withdrawal from international treaties and organizations demonstrates the Trump administration’s total lack of regard for international law and the global community, especially the Global South. It furthers Trump’s attack against defenders of Mother Earth, biodiversity, human rights, environmental, economic, and climate justice and those fighting for labor and immigrants’ rights and legal protections. It is very concerning that this administration seeks to avoid accountability with global impacts undermining the need for global cooperation. We need leaders committed to real solutions, not capitulating to the whims of fossil fuel and corporate interests that further violate the distinct inherent collective rights of Indigenous Peoples, and accelerate environmental destruction at a time of escalating climate crisis. ” -Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director, Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) &#8220;This decision is not abstract- it&#8217;s existential. Trump&#8217;s draconian retreat from responsibility is one that protects polluters while abandoning all of us, our livelihoods, and Mother Earth. This move undermines treaty obligations, tribal sovereignty, and the global cooperation needed to survive the climate crisis.&#8221; -KD Chavez, executive director, Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) Some of the Climate related bodies the Trump administration pulled out of: UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): The foundational 1992 treaty that coordinates global climate action and hosts the annual COP summits. As of January 2026, the U.S. is currently the only nation in the world to be a non-party to this framework! Paris Agreement: A major 2015 legally binding international treaty on climate change adopted by 195 parties (nation-states) at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, Session Twenty-One (COP21) in Paris, France, December 12, 2015; Trump initiated a second U.S. withdrawal immediately upon returning to office in 2025, which officially took effect in January 2026. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): The world’s leading UN-backed authority on climate science and assessment. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): An intergovernmental organization that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future. UN Oceans and UN Water: Inter-agency mechanisms that coordinate UN activities related to freshwater and marine environments, respectively. International Solar Alliance (ISA): An alliance aimed at promoting solar energy deployment. Carbon-Free Energy Compact (24/7 CFE): A UN-linked initiative to accelerate the decarbonization of electricity grids. Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES): An independent body focused on the conservation of biodiversity. International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO): An intergovernmental body promoting the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN): An international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. UNESCO: UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, a specialized agency that handles scientific and cultural cooperation. ### The post CJA Condemns Trump&#8217;s Move to Pull the US out of International Bodies appeared first on Climate Justice Alliance.
