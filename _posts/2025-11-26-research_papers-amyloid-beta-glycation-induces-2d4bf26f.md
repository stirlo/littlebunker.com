Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 47, November 2025. SignificanceThis study reveals how a modified form of amyloid-beta (Aβ) disrupts mitochondrial function in neurons, triggering innate immunity and disease progression. We show that this modified Aβ damages mitochondria, activating a specific immune ...
