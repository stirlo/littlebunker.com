Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 34, August 2025. For centuries, scientists have been puzzled by the mystery of life’s biomolecular homochirality—the single-handedness of biological compounds. Sugars and nucleic acids are right-handed, while amino acids are left-handed in biological systems. Likewise, ...
