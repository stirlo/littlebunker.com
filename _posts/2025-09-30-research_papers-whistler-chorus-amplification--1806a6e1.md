Abstract We present a novel nonlinear model for whistler‐mode chorus amplification based on the free‐electron laser (FEL) mechanism. First, we derive the nonlinear collective variable equations for the whistler‐electron interaction. Consistent with in situ satellite observations, these equations predict that a small seed wave can undergo exponential growth, reaching a peak of a few hundred picoteslas after a few milliseconds, followed by millisecond timescale amplitude modulations. Next, we show that when one accounts for multiple wave frequencies and wave spatial variations, the amplitude and phase of the whistler wave can be described by the Ginzburg‐Landau equation (GLE), providing a framework for the investigation of solitary wave behavior of chorus modes. These findings enhance our understanding of wave‐particle interactions and space weather in the Van Allen radiation belts, deepen the connection between whistler‐electron dynamics and FELs, and reveal a novel connection between whistler‐mode chorus and the GLE.
