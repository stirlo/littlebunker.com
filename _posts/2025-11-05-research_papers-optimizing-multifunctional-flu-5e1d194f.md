Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 44, November 2025. SignificanceUnderstanding cellular processes requires tools to measure and manipulate biomolecules in living systems. Self-labeling tags, such as the HaloTag, enable the attachment of synthetic molecules to specific proteins inside cells. Creating ligands ...
