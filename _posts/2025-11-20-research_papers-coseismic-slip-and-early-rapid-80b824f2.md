Abstract The 2025 destructive Myanmar earthquake ruptured the previously recognized seismic gap along the Sagaing fault, with the longest ever recorded surface ruptures (∼ ${\\sim} $500 km). Here, we use SAR and optical images to characterize coseismic and early postseismic deformation of this event. North‐south displacements delineate the extent of surface ruptures, which are confined between historically ruptured regions, supported by dramatic slip reductions along the strike near the two rupture terminations. Coseismic slip model suggests two high‐slip zones of distinct sizes separated by a low‐slip zone. Coseismic slip has peak values at the surface almost all along the rupture, suggesting an absence of shallow slip deficits. Early postseismic deformation over ∼ ${\\sim} $1 month after the event is obtained by optical horizontal offsets. Rapid shallow afterslip (∼ ${\\sim} $5 cm/day) is only found along the southern segment, with some spatial overlap with coseismically slipped zones indicating frictional heterogeneity of the Sagaing fault.
