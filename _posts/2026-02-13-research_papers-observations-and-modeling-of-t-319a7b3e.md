Abstract Transient luminous events (TLEs), such as sprites, have been investigated via observations and simulations for decades. Recent TLE research has focused on effects leading to the delay of a sprite from its parent lightning flash. Here we investigate a sprite with by far the longest recorded delay to date, a delay of almost a full second (916.6 ± 16.6 ms) from the onset of the parent flash, as observed from the ISS during the ILAN‐ES campaign on 6 February 2024. Based on meteorological, satellite, and ground‐based ELF data, we reconstruct a realistic charge configuration for the parent thunderstorm. We input this reconstructed charge configuration to a 3D quasi‐electrostatic model in order to simulate regions of possible sprite inception as a function of time corresponding to this sprite event following the lightning. We demonstrate how the observed delayed sprite could have been incepted by a prolonged piecewise pattern of the current in the parent flash.
