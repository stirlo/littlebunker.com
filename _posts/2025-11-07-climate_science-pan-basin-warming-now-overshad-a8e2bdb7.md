Nature Climate Change, Published online: 07 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02482-zNatural patterns of climate variability, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), strongly influence regional climate. This study shows that anthropogenic warming now has greater influence than the PDO on North Pacific sea surface temperatures, with implications for predictability and impacts.
