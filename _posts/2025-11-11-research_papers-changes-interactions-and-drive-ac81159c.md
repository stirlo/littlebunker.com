Recycling organic waste products (OWPs) is known to influence soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, yet few studies have compared the long-term effects of different OWP type across multiple sites. This study examined the impacts of repeated OWP application on soil properties in two French long-term field experiments: QualiAgro and PROspective (20 and 18 years, respectively). The OWP included dehydrated urban sewage sludge (SLU), green waste and SLU compost, biowaste compost from source-separated municipal organic waste co-composted with green waste, municipal solid waste compost, farmyard manure from a dairy cow farm (FYM), and composted FYM from open-air composting on a concrete platform. The application of OWP led to increased soil nutrient levels and trace element availability, and stimulated microbial biomass and enzyme activities, while the response of nematode varied depending on site and OWP type. Biological properties were less affected than physico-chemical properties, though the OWP application enhanced soil microbial biomass and specific enzyme activities. The impact on soil nematode communities varied depending on OWP type and site. Strong correlations were observed among soil property changes, with exogenous carbon and nutrient inputs from OWP identified as key drivers. Larger changes were noted in QualiAgro, where OWP application rates were higher and initial soil quality lower. These findings highlight that OWP applications, depending on their type, rate, and initial soil conditions, can significantly alter soil properties.
