Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceGiven climate change, there is an urgent need to conserve natural populations of forest trees and associated ecosystems. In contrast to a growing body of literature on genomic offsets and related approaches, we argue that genomic data will ...
