Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 38, September 2025. SignificanceTropical cyclone (TC) size strongly affects its hazards and impacts. This study shows that observed TC size expands substantially faster over relatively warmer water across the major Northern Hemisphere ocean basins. Expansion rates increase ...
