Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceIslet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) oligomers are toxic intermediates in the protein aggregation pathway that are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. Mammals besides humans also have IAPP variants that can aggregate, with most ...
