Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 52, December 2025. SignificanceAtaxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic genetic disorder caused by mutations in theATMgene. Its gene product, ATM kinase, is canonically involved in regulating DNA damage responses. Herein, we describe how ATM regulates the ...
