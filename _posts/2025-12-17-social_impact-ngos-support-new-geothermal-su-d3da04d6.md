We, the undersigned groups, welcome the release of the Geothermal Sustainable Development Pact and the underlying Principles for Responsible Geothermal Development.Next-generation geothermal technologies can provide needed sources of clean, resilient heat and electricity. The principles and provisions contained in the Geothermal Sustainable Development Pact are a commendable initial step in identifying best practices for the responsible development of these resources.These principles contain important parameters, including early engagement and consultation with local communities, fair labor practices, avoidance and protection of sensitive areas and environmental and cultural resources, protection of water resources, use of near-zero emissions electricity generation technologies, and the use of best available induced seismicity mitigation measures. &nbsp;The Geothermal Sustainable Development Pact also includes notable provisions that can help overcome public data gaps and lead to more informed policymaking and project planning for next-generation geothermal. These include provisions on the public disclosure of chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids, public disclosure of water intensity data, and the use of the best available induced seismicity protocol developed by the U.S. Department of Energy.Our groups look forward to working with industry and other partners in a collaborative process on the further development, refinement, and implementation of these principles and pact provisions to support the sustainable development of next-generation geothermal energy.Sincerely,Center for Public EnterpriseClean Air Task ForceEnvironmental Defense FundFederation of American ScientistsLeague of Conservation VotersNational Wildlife FederationThe Nature ConservancyWorld Resources Institute
