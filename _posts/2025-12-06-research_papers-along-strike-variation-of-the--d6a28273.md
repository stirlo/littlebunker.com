Abstract The 2025 Mw7.1 Dingri earthquake, one of the shallowest documented M7+ normal‐faulting earthquakes on the Tibetan Plateau since 1900, exhibited a complex rupture process investigated through source inversion techniques and multi‐data integration, including near‐field strong‐motion recordings, regional broadband waveforms, teleseismic body and surface waves, and InSAR observations. The centroid depth (∼4.8 km) was robustly constrained by seismic and geodetic data. The three‐segment fault model indicates a dominant northward‐propagating rupture with two high‐slip asperities peaking at ∼4 m. The 24‐s rupture involved primarily Faults 1 and 2, with a strike change from N190°E to N150°E and dip angles of 35°–50°. Normal‐faulting dominated above 10 km depth, generating discontinuous surface fractures with vertical offsets up to 2.3 m. This earthquake likely released east‐west extensional stress resulting from the Indo‐Eurasian plate collision. A 14‐km‐long shallow slip deficit segment near Dengme Co was identified, warranting enhanced monitoring for improved seismic hazard assessment.
