Abstract Tracking the temporal dynamics of urban heat island (UHI) is critical for urban heat adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, whether UHI trends have shifted recently and their underlying drivers remain unknown. Here we investigate the variabilities in surface UHI trends and their associated determinants in 2,104 cities worldwide from 2000 to 2022. Our findings reveal that approximately half of the world's cities have experienced notable shifts in surface UHI trends, predominantly characterized by UHI deceleration. These shifts can be primarily attributed to alterations in vegetation trends during the day and to modifications in surface albedo and local warming trends at night. Our study challenges the conventional linear models commonly employed to estimate surface UHI trends, suggesting potential biases in such estimates. Our findings underscore the need for nuanced policies to curtail UHI growth by considering changes in urban underlying surfaces and background climate, particularly from a nonlinear perspective.
