Nature Climate Change, Published online: 21 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02486-9Climate change is expected to lead to higher day-to-day temperature variability in mid- to low latitudes. Here the authors show that extreme day-to-day temperature changes have distinct impacts on human health and become more frequent and intense in mid- to low latitudes with climate change.
