Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 24, June 2025. SignificanceElucidating subcellular mechanisms of protein kinase signaling remains challenging due to the lack of spatial precision by genetic knockdown or pharmacological approaches. Here, synthetic intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) were engineered ...
