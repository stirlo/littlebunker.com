Nature Climate Change, Published online: 13 June 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02350-wGlancing forward to view alternative futures for limiting global warming requires understanding complex societalâ€“environmental systems that drive future emissions. Now a study explores the potential, and limits, of deep learning to generate core characteristics of these futures.
