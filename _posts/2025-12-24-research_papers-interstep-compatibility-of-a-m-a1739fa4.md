Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 51, December 2025. SignificanceRNA may have been the first informational molecule to support Darwinian evolution, and life, on Hadean Earth and/or Noachian Mars. Thus, any model that produces RNA from simple organic molecules is relevant to understanding how life emerged ...
