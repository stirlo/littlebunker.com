Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 38, September 2025. SignificanceBacteria have evolved complex ways to export proteins and one important pathway in Gram-positive bacteria is the type VII secretion system (T7SS). The T7SS exports protein toxins that play a role in both virulence and bacterial competition. ...
