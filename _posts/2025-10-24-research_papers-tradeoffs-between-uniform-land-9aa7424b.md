Nearly 200 countries have pledged to conserve 30% of terrestrial ecosystems to stop the global biodiversity crisis. However, biodiversity is not uniformly distributed across countries. Adequately addressing this crisis requires a scientific basis for selecting protected land that considers both ecological benefits and impacts to humans. We use the global change analysis model to evaluate land use tradeoffs of four land protection cases under two climate cases. We find that biodiversity-specific land protection up to 39% globally can reduce land use constraints and food prices compared to protecting 30% of land uniformly in each country (’30 × 30’ initiative). Valuing terrestrial carbon for climate change mitigation reduces land conversion pressure and can complement protection strategies. Global impacts to agriculture of additional land protection are small, but regional impacts vary and may be considerable. Overall, biodiversity-specific land protection has greater potential than a uniform target to meet both ecological and human needs.
