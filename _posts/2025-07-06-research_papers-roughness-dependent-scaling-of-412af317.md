Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceThe actual contact area between two rough surfaces directly dictates friction, adhesion, and thermal/electrical conductivity. However, measurements of contact areas have been challenging due to optical diffraction limits and the scattering of ...
