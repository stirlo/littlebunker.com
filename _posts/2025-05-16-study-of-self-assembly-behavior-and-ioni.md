Abstract
   
   
    The unique self-assembly of liquid crystals (LCs), combined with their potential application as organic semiconductors, has become a focus of recent research. Here, a joint experimental and computational study of the self-assembly and ionic conduction was carried out on a series of T-shaped conjugated LCs consisting of three incompatible components. By extending the EOn side-chain length, several experimental evaluations confirmed a decrease of the order-disorder transition temperature, while coarse-grained simulations revealed a structural evolution from a smectic phase to a columnar phase. Ionic conductivity of these molecules was achieved by adding Li salt, leading to a maximum conductivity of 1.1 × 10

    siemens per centimeter observed at 120°C. All-atom simulations were performed to examine the Li-ion solvation environment and to evaluate the intrachain and interchain Li-ion hopping mechanisms. The molecule with a long EOn side chain was found to generate a densely distributed network of Li-ion solvation sites, which can facilitate effective interchain hopping to promote ion transport.
