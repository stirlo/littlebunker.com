Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 44, November 2025. SignificanceAmmonia (NH3) emissions from human activities can significantly influence aerosol processes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Using an Earth system model, we show that anthropogenic NH3strongly enhances new particle ...
