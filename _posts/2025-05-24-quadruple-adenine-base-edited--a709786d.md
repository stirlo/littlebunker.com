Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 20, May 2025. SignificanceThis study reveals that Cas9 nuclease-induced genotoxicity can compromise the fitness of gene-edited human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, thereby diminishing their therapeutic efficacy beyond the known risks of chromosomal ...
