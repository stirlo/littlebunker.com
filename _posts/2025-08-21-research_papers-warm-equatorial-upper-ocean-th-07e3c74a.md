Abstract The tropical Pacific climate has an outsized impact on global climate, yet future projections are poorly constrained. Data‐model comparisons from the mid‐Pliocene warm period (∼ ${\\sim} $3.3 million years ago) can help investigate warm climate dynamics and evaluate model behavior. Here we compare proxy records to PlioMIP2 models and a model with modified cloud albedo. Relative to modern, the mid‐Pliocene warm period records show subsurface warming across the tropical Pacific, strong eastern Pacific surface warming and weak western Pacific surface warming. Using clustering analyses to group model behavior relative to the proxy data, we find the model cluster with the best fit with the proxy data has enhanced warming in mid‐latitude thermocline source water regions which connect to the equator through the ventilated thermocline. Our study shows tropical ocean heat content during the mid‐Pliocene warm period was higher than today and has broad implications for the ocean's ability to absorb anthropogenic heat.
