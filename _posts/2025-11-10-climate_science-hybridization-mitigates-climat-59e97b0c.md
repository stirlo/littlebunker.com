Nature Climate Change, Published online: 10 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02485-wUsing population and ecological genomic approaches, the authors demonstrate the potential for interspecific introgression—the transfer of genetic material following hybridization—to reduce climate change vulnerability. Their findings emphasize the importance of preserving interspecific connectivity.
