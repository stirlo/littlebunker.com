Abstract We simulated a tropical cyclone in an idealized environment, from its weak initial vortex to maturity, using a regional numerical weather prediction model with a uniform horizontal resolution of 100 m, regarded as a large eddy simulation (LES). Results of the LES were compared with those of the same model, but with a horizontal resolution of 2 km. Both experiments attained similar peak intensities (∼920 ${\\sim} 920$ hPa), but the LES uniquely captured kilometer‐scale rolls in the boundary layer, persistent shallow mesovortices near the eyewall, and countless sub‐kilometer‐scale patches of positive and negative vorticity. Rapid intensification (RI) in the LES was delayed by approximately 26 hr relative to that in the 2 km model. Composite analysis confirmed that mesovortices interfered with the azimuthally averaged secondary circulation. The prevalence of negative vorticity and decelerated inflow in the LES are likely to delay the RI.
