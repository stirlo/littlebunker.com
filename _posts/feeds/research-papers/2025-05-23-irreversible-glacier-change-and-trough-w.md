Nature Climate Change, Published online: 19 May 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02318-wHow mountain glaciers will react to temporarily overshooting 1.5 °C of warming is poorly understood. Here the authors show irreversible global glacier loss for centuries after overshoot, implying long-term reductions in glacial water resources with amplified impacts in regions where glaciers regrow.
