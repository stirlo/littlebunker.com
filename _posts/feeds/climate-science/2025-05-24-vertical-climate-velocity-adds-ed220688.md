Nature Climate Change, Published online: 21 May 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02300-6The authors combine horizontal and vertical climate velocities to understand how marine species shift in response to climate change. They show that vertical velocity, which is often overlooked, better explains climate responses, with implications for species adaptation and fishing resources.
