    Abstract
   
   
    Space exploration, particularly in the extreme space environment, has gained increasing attention. Networked robots capable of real-time environmental perception and autonomous collaboration offer a promising alternative for executing complex precision tasks. Consequently, achieving local reliable communication and preparing irradiation-tolerant materials are essential. Here, we demonstrate a cephalopod-inspired neuromorphic loop that enables chromaticity communication between individual near-sensor processing units. A programmatically aligned aluminum zinc oxide nanofiber array was fabricated and used as conductive channels that can withstand prolonged (~10
    
     4
    
    seconds) and high-dose (~5 × 10
    
     15
    
    ions per square centimeter) proton irradiation. The neuromorphic loop, with capabilities in environmental perception, event-driven processing, adaptive learning, and chromaticity communication, enables the self-driven collaboration of robotic hands based on tactile feedback and ensures reliable mobile links for drone flight control. This work pioneers a direction in neuromorphic visible light communication and marks important progress in the field of biomimetic intelligence.
