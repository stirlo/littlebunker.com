Nature Climate Change, Published online: 14 May 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02332-yUsing seven generations of selected zebrafish (Danio rerio), the authors consider the trade-offs and mechanisms behind evolution of warming tolerance. They show unexpected improvements in cooling tolerance in warming-adapted fish, and highlight mechanistic insights behind warming tolerance.
