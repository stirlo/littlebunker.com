    Abstract
   
   
    Resistive switching devices are promising candidates for the next generation of nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing applications. Despite the advantages in retention and on/off ratio, filamentary-based memristors still suffer from challenges, particularly endurance (flash being a benchmark system showing 10

    cycles) and uniformity. Here, we use WO

    as a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–compatible switching oxide and demonstrate a proof-of-concept materials design approach to enhance endurance and device-to-device uniformity in WO

All these metrics are achieved using a one-step pulsed laser deposition process to create self-assembled nanocomposite thin films that have regular guided filaments of ≈100-nanometer pitch, preformed between WO
