Climate Justice Alliance’s Black Caucus announced the recipients of its regranting program. A total of $170,000 will be regranted to 11 organizations spanning 9 states to make a meaningful impact within Black communities. Each organization has the flexibility to allocate the funds as they see fit, provided they are used to benefit Black members of the organization or the surrounding Black community.
Despite the barrage of negative news and policy moves aimed to stun and immobilize us, environmental justice communities continue to find a way, through no way. These funds will ensure that Black communities and the critical work being carried out to combat environmental racism continue, as we build just solutions that protect and safeguard our people and community members.
“CJA’s Black Caucus Capacity grants are one of the first steps to fulfilling our commitment to building capacity in Black communities, allowing us to lead unapologetically with pro-Black intention. Grants are crucial because they provide essential funding to support marginalized communities and organizations. By supporting our Black communities, we are advocating for the most vulnerable, providing them with much needed funds to make a difference and provide a lasting impact,” shared Rebecca Rosado, Kohlbi McPhail, and Rhoda Overstreet who make up CJA’s Black Caucus Leadership Team. 
CJA executive director, KD Chavez explained, “In this new period of highly publicized racist attacks and non-sensical policies aimed to distract, harm and intimidate us all, we stand firm in our commitment to environmental and climate justice. CJA will continue to support our members, especially Black communities, often hit first and worst by the climate crisis as we continue to support frontline communities as they fight the bad and build the new.“
