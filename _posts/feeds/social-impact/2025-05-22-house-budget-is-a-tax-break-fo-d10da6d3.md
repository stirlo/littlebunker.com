Statement from Climate Justice Alliance Executive Director, KD Chavez:
&#8220;This bill gives massive tax breaks to the wealthiest while hurting working families. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirms it: low-income families will lose hundreds, even thousands of dollars, while the top 0.1% get a windfall in extra income next year. 
That&#8217;s money that could be used for groceries, healthcare, or childcare. Instead, it&#8217;s lining the pockets of billionaires and pouring billions into the Pentagon and defense contractors. 
This bill takes away vital health care and food assistance from struggling communities to pay for these handouts to the wealthy. It&#8217;s wrong, and we need to stop it.
Rather than giving handouts to the rich and cutting critical services like Medicaid and funding for state run clean air and water programs, projects that families in every zip code depend on, we should prioritize sensible investments that leave no one behind. Things like community led renewable energy and grid expansion programs that create good paying jobs, superfund site clean ups and remediation, green housing and resiliency infrastructure buildouts, and more. 
This is how we create opportunity for every community, not just a wealthy few. The Senate must do what the House couldn’t and actually represent the will of the people.&#8221;
