Abstract Large volcanic eruptions produce various atmospheric wave perturbations. One of these wave manifestations is atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs), which can be observed through remote sensing satellite measurements. Based on multisensory instruments on board Aqua, Suomi NPP, and Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellites, we discuss the propagation of AGWs across stratospheric and mesospheric altitudes following three large volcanic eruptions of 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai, 11 April 2021 La Soufrière, and 13 February 2014 Kelud. Following the events, the mechanical updraft of air, observed as tropopause overshooting and the enhanced H2O in Microwave Limb Sounder measurements, contributed to the convective generation of AGWs through mechanical oscillator effect and thermal forcing. The present study is an important and useful contribution in compiling the propagation of AGWs across various atmospheric layers and substantiating their convective generation, for large volcanic eruptions. Thereby, strengthening our understanding of lithosphere‐atmosphere coupling through wave‐dynamic pathways by reinforcing the existing knowledge.
