Abstract Understanding creep is essential for assessing seismic hazards along the creeping Hayward Fault, which threatens the San Francisco area. Current 1‐D monitoring methods, like creepmeters and theodolites, provide limited measurements with low spatial resolution. InSAR offers higher 2‐D spatial sampling but lower temporal resolution. We introduce a novel method using coda wave interferometry (CWI) to monitor creep in 2‐D with high resolution. By calculating changes in ambient seismic noise travel times, we relate these measurements to creep offsets, bridging the gap between existing methods. Applied to seismic data from 2021 around the Hayward Fault, our CWI‐derived offsets aligned with creepmeter measurements, revealing continuous and episodic creep. A 2‐D regionalization identified a spatial boundary between these regimes, corroborating previous findings. This approach could enhance seismic monitoring and improve understanding of fault mechanics and earthquake risks.
