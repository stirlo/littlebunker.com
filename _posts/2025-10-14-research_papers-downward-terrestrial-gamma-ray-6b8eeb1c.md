Abstract We observed a terrestrial gamma‐ray flash (TGF) shortly after the return stroke in a positive cloud‐to‐ground (+CG) flash during a 2025 winter thunderstorm in the Hokuriku region of Japan. The event was observed with multiple gamma‐ray detectors and radio antenna systems. We identify several distinctions between our event and typical +CG lightning, including: an inverted tripolar storm charge structure, a peak current (190 kA) much higher than reported averages, shorter‐than‐average leader duration between first radio source and return stroke (3.6 vs. 56 ms), and unusual symmetry in the return stroke RF waveform relating to rise and fall time. Many of these differences are consistent with disparities between usual −CG lightning and energetic compact strokes (ECSs), and may be evidence of a positive‐polarity class of ECS events. In addition, we find our TGF observation to be a distinctly short and bright event among others reported in literature.
