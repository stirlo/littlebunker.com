Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceThe mechanisms by which proteins are produced at specific sites and inserted into the intricate membrane systems of photosynthetic cyanobacteria are only partially understood. While RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain proteins are well-studied ...
