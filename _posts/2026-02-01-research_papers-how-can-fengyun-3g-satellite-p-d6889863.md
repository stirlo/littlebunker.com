Abstract The observations from Precipitation Measurement Radar (PMR) and Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI‐RM) onboard FengYun‐3G satellite are first time utilized to derive multi‐phase hydrometeors in clouds. The FY‐3G hydrometeor retrieval algorithm utilizes the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) as its core module. It incorporates PMR‐derived graupel and rainwater data as first guess for retrieving cloud parameters from MWRI‐RM observations. Since the ARMS includes the graupel in its forward simulations, FY‐3G algorithm can retrieve more accurate distributions of graupel water and rain water through radar‐informed 1D‐Var retrieval (One‐dimensional variational). After incorporating the PMR results, it becomes evident that the profile of rainwater content has increased with the more detail vertical structures. In a high‐value region of rainwater path, the magnitude increases about 25% from 4 mm of MWRI‐RM value. Meanwhile, the graupel water path decreases about 17% from 0.8 mm.
