Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceFrictional force on bodies in relative motion typically increases with the normal load, indicating a positive friction coefficient. Systems with negative friction coefficients have been demonstrated but only with low magnitudes. Using ...
