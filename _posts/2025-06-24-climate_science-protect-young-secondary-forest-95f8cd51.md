Nature Climate Change, Published online: 24 June 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02355-5The authors generate ~1-km2 growth curves for aboveground live carbon in regrowing forests, globally. They show that maximum carbon removal rates can vary by 200-fold spatially and with age, with the greatest rates estimated at about 30 Â± 12 years, highlighting the role of secondary forests in carbon cycling.
