Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 25, June 2025. SignificanceCO2mitigation policy is expected to suppress global warming and its climate impact; however, this study found that CO2mitigation could cause an abrupt shortening of El Niño periodicity, which enhances the frequency of El Niño and potential ...
