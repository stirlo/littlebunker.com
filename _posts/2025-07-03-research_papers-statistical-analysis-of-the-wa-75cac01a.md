Abstract The warm plasma cloak (WPC) is a plasma population located in the outer magnetosphere. It is composed primarily of electrons and H+ ${\mathrm{H}}^{+}$ ions with energies of tens to hundreds electronvolts and can contain significant amounts of O+ ${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$. We conduct a statistical survey of the WPC using 9 years of observations in the dayside magnetosphere from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. WPC is found in 51% $51\%$ of the observations and it is 1.6 times more abundant in the dawn than in the dusk sector. O+ ${\mathrm{O}}^{+}$‐rich WPC is detected in 7.5% $7.5\%$ of the observations, being 3 times more probable in the dawn sector. We find that after a peak of strong geomagnetic activity, it takes approximately 9 hr to detect the WPC in the dayside magnetosphere.
