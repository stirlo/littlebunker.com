Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 36, September 2025. SignificanceThis study reveals the structural basis for allosteric modulation of SV2A, a key synaptic vesicle protein and target for epilepsy. Structures of the SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283, -UCB-J, and -UCB7361 complexes show that simultaneous binding of certain ...
