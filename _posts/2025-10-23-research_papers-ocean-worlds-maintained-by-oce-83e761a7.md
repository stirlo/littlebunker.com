Abstract In recent NASA decadal surveys, detecting oceans among Uranus' moons has been identified as a research priority in future missions. Currently, the prevailing view in planetary science is that the likelihood of finding oceans is highest on the larger moons, Titania and Oberon, due to their higher integrals of radiogenic heat sources. This study shows that the smaller moons—Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel—are the most viable candidates and should support thick oceans through a process of “self‐tuned resonance.” In self‐tuned resonance, a system dynamically adjusts both its resonance conditions (maximizing stored energy) and its dissipation efficiency (approaching critical damping), resulting in increased dissipation/heating and long‐term stabilization against secular trends (in this case, freezing.) These results can explain observations of the surface geology and heat flux on the inner moons that implicate heating values exceeding 25 mW/m2.
