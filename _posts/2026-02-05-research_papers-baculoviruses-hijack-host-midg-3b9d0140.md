Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceBaculoviruses can manipulate host behavior, leading to death at elevated positions. Herein, we present compelling evidence that this baculovirus-induced phototactic climbing inHelicoverpa armigeralarvae enhances the transmission ofH. ...
