Abstract We calculate cross‐component correlations and receiver functions from teleseismic earthquakes recorded by a seismic nodal array deployed in the central Vienna Basin, Austria. The two methods show similar results. Those results highlight two main layer boundaries between the surface and 15 km depth. We attribute the first layer boundary to the Aderklaa Conglomerate Formation within the Neogene basin and the second layer boundary to the top of the crystalline basement in the area. A vertical offset along the profile potentially highlights two local tectonic faults. This study contributes to the understanding of the subsurface structure in the Vienna Basin, with implications for regional tectonic processes and resource exploration. The cross‐component correlation method demonstrates strong potential for resolving interfaces in complex sedimentary environments.
