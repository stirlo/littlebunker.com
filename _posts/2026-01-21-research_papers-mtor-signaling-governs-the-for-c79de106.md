Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceThis study unravels a regulatory mechanism governing the formation of actin-based apical projections in epithelial cells. Microridges, evolutionarily conserved projections on squamous epithelial cells in vertebrates, are essential for mucus ...
