Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 25, June 2025. SignificanceClimate change is increasing the frequency and severity of boreal summer extreme weather events, many of which are inextricably linked to the phenomenon of resonant planetary wave amplification. However, due to incomplete knowledge of climate ...
