Abstract Recent years have seen severe wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere. This study statistically links atmospheric blocks to extreme fire weather (FDP99 ${\\text{FD}}_{\\mathit{P99}}$) and observed fires (OF) across seasons from 1979 to 2020. Based on co‐location and odds ratio statistics, we find that a substantial part of FDP99 ${\\text{FD}}_{\\mathit{P99}}$ co‐occurs with blocks. In areas where blocks occur regularly, blocks increase the odds of FDP99 ${\\text{FD}}_{\\mathit{P99}}$ by a factor of 4–5, with up to a 30‐fold increase locally. The link between blocks and FDP99 ${\\text{FD}}_{\\mathit{P99}}$ is stronger at latitudes north of 50° ${}^{\\circ}$N, but exhibits regional and seasonal variations. We also find a significant link between blocks and OF in the Arctic regions during summer. This study reveals new links between atmospheric blocks and wildfire danger.
