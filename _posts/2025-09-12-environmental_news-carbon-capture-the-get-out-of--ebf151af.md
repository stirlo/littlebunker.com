Engineers have been trying to perfect the technology for years but the maximum effect it could manage is far short of what the planet needsCarbon capture and storage is a simple idea. As the carbon dioxide comes out of a steel mill, cement works or chemical factory, capture it and feed it into a pipeline before it gets into the atmosphere. The pipeline leads to an old oilfield or deep mine and is pumped underground to be sealed for all time and so save the world from global heating.Britain is committed to spending £30bn on this technology, which is a get-out-of-jail-free card for heavy industry and a magic way of getting to net zero without having to actually cut emissions.
