Abstract Compound wind and precipitation extremes (CWPEs) pose significant threats to natural resources and the socio‐economic security. This study investigates the projected changes and driving factors of CWPEs over Southeast Asia (SEA) based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 outputs. Results show that the frequency of CWPEs during 2070–2099 is projected to increase by 56.6% (62.2%) under the SSP2‐4.5 (SSP5‐8.5) scenario, while intensity is expected to increase by 11.9% (25.5%). These changes are primarily driven by variations in precipitation, which account for 54.9%–85.7% of the total contribution under the two scenarios mentioned. We further revealed that the probability of high‐frequency (high‐risk) CWPEs will increase by a factor of 2.3 (1.6), with 56.2% (37.3%) of the risk increase is attributable to anthropogenic activities. These findings emphasize the high sensitivity of CWPEs to climate change over SEA, and underscores the importance in informing adaptation strategies for vulnerable regions.
