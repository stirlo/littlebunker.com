Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 52, December 2025. SignificanceAdvances in robotics demand sophisticated tactile perception akin to human skin’s multifaceted sensing and protective functions. Current robotic electronic skins rely on simple design and provide basic functions like pressure sensing. Our ...
