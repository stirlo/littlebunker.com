Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 27, July 2025. SignificanceThe problem of singularity formation of the 3D incompressible Euler equations with smooth initial data has remained open since Leonhard Euler introduced the equations in 1757. Beyond its importance in partial differential equations (PDE) ...
