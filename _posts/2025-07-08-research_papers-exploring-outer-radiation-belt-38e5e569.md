Abstract The precipitation of energetic electrons from the outer radiation belt plays a crucial role in regulating their flux dynamics and influencing ionospheric properties. While theoretical and numerical studies, often based on near‐equatorial spacecraft measurements, are essential for assessing the precipitation efficiency, low‐altitude observations offer a direct and effective method for monitoring these losses. This study analyzes a new data set of energetic electron precipitation captured by the CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) and the Monitor of All‐sky X‐ray Image (MAXI) aboard the International Space Station. By comparing CALET and MAXI measurements with low‐altitude observations from ELFIN, we identified three distinct precipitation patterns: those driven by electron scattering from whistler‐mode waves, electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, and field‐line curvature scattering (FLCS). Each pattern exhibits unique characteristics, allowing us to construct a statistical picture of precipitation based on CALET and MAXI data. A key finding from this analysis is the substantial contribution of FLCS‐driven precipitation within the outer radiation belt. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating FLCS as a significant loss mechanism in radiation belt models.
