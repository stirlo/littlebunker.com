Nature Climate Change, Published online: 22 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02538-0Changes in ocean fronts could impact biological productivity and carbon exchange. By analysing satellite and reanalysis data, the authors identify areas with active frontal activity and rapid change in properties, as well as highlighting the correspondence with surface productivity and CO2 uptake.
