Abstract We present the first geomorphic evidence for successive, surface‐rupturing earthquakes throughout the Quaternary on the Tintina fault in the Yukon Territory, northwestern Canada. A ∼130‐km‐long series of scarps and pressure ridges offset 2.6 Ma and 132 ka landforms by ∼500–1,500 m and 65–85 m, respectively, indicating a dextral slip rate of ∼0.2–0.8 mm/yr. However, early Holocene terraces are undeformed across the fault, implying that the elapsed time since the most recent earthquake is >12 kyr and that the fault may be nearing the end of a long interseismic cycle. A minimum slip deficit of ∼6 m has likely accrued since the last major surface rupture, and future earthquakes could exceed Mw 7.5. These results highlight the hazards of earthquakes on mature, low‐slip‐rate intraplate faults, which may have exceptionally long recurrence intervals, elude instrumental networks, and lack a distinct surface expression due to landscape resetting.
