Abstract Extreme open‐ocean phytoplankton events can influence marine ecosystems, yet their global occurrence, drivers, and consequences remain poorly understood. Most large‐scale studies rely on satellite chlorophyll, which provides only a surface view, is affected by physiological variability, and is often missing due to clouds and low sunlight. Here, we use an Earth system model with a satellite chlorophyll simulator to test when and where vertically integrated phytoplankton biomass extremes align with satellite‐detected chlorophyll extremes. Globally, about 10% of low and 19% of high phytoplankton biomass extremes are detected. The detection rate is the result of the combined impacts of missing data and extreme misalignment: only 34% of low and 56% of high detected chlorophyll extremes correspond with true biomass extremes, with the largest discrepancies occurring in the subtropical gyres. These findings highlight the need for caution when interpreting satellite chlorophyll as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass extremes.
