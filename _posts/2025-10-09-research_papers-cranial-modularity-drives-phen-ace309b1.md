Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 40, October 2025. SignificanceAntarctic notothenioid fishes are a prime example of adaptive radiation in one of Earthâ€™s harshest environments. This study examines how changes in skull shape, driven by cranial modularity, have influenced their evolutionary success. By ...
