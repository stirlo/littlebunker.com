Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceMacrophage-produced methylglyoxal can restrict the growth of bacteria likeListeria monocytogenesbut notMycobacterium tuberculosis, suggestingM. tuberculosishas mechanisms to resist methylglyoxal toxicity. Using a genetic screen, we ...
