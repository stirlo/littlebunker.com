Abstract This paper presents an analysis of Juno's first radio occultation experiments. Relying on two‐way radio links in the X‐ and Ka‐bands, we processed data from NASA's Deep Space Network antennas through a ray‐tracing inversion algorithm. By effectively isolating dispersive effects, we obtained measurements of the neutral atmosphere's characteristics. This enabled the derivation of pressure and temperature profiles from the recorded frequencies. These results complement prior data from Voyager occultations and CIRS observations, providing valuable contributions to our understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics.
