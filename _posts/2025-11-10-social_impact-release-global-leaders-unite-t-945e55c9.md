Belém, Brazil (November 12, 2025) – Today at the COP30 UN climate conference, leaders from governments, businesses, civil society and philanthropy launched a new global effort that puts people’s jobs and skills at heart of the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy.&nbsp;Developed in collaboration with the COP30 Presidency and a broad coalition of international partners, the Global Initiative on Jobs &amp; Skills for the New Economy aims to accelerate investment in human capital, foster social inclusion, and align workforce development with national climate and economic strategies. The Initiative responds to growing demand for practical solutions that make climate action work for people — creating jobs, developing skills, and ensuring social protection as economies transform.“Here in Belém, we must show that climate action is not only about emissions and technologies, but about people and their future,” said COP30 CEO Ana Toni, who co-hosted the event launch. “Let us come together in the spirit of mutirão — the collective energy of communities working together — to build a fairer and more prosperous future for all.”The Initiative builds on new global research from Systemiq and World Resources Institute (WRI) which shows that the climate transition could create an estimated 375 million new jobs over the next decade, particularly in renewable energy, construction and nature-based solutions. Adaptation activities, such as building resilient infrastructure, are expected to be a major source of employment as well, generating an estimated 280 million jobs worldwide.Realizing the potential for new jobs will require unprecedented coordination among governments, business and international financial institutions. The new analysis sets out an Action Agenda across three key pillars:Intentionality: Embed jobs and skills strategies in national climate and industrial plans, backed by data-driven workforce intelligence and local transition pacts.Innovation: Build modern, modular training systems and industry-led consortia to align skills with emerging green sectors.Investment: Treat spending on human capital as investment, not consumption, mobilizing domestic revenues, business incentives, and international finance for long-term workforce development.Access the Leaders Summary and new research here.“The transition to a new economy is not a burden, but a historic opportunity to create jobs, empower youth and drive inclusive growth,” said Hon. Dr. Eng. Festus K. Ng’eno, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry, Kenya. “With over 40% of Kenyans employed in agriculture and a rapidly growing youth population, investing in our people’s skills for sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and transport is essential to building a more resilient, competitive and equitable economy for generations to come.”“The data is clear — the skills needed for jobs are changing faster than ever,” said Allen Blue, Co-Founder of LinkedIn. “Our research shows demand for green talent continues to grow at twice the pace of skills in the workforce. Closing this gap will only happen with urgent, coordinated action to put green training at the core of every climate and business plan. Doing so not only accelerates progress, it connects people to economic opportunity.”To deliver impact, the Initiative will work across different tracks to bring together knowledge and learning, help to establish country and industry action partnerships and build a movement. Early engagement is underway with countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, and partnerships are forming with leading development institutions and private-sector coalitions. As a foundation for further cooperation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH commissioned and published three country case studies (Brazil, Kenya and Pakistan), while the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German government funded a case study on the impact of skills shortages on global power emissions.Leaders supporting the new Initiative underscored how the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy will succeed only if it is powered by skilled, secure and supported workers. They called for a new compact between climate and development actors, positioning human capital as a central pillar of economic and climate transition strategies:“A people-centered transition is both a moral imperative and an economic necessity,” said Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. “Social protection, opportunities for retraining and job transition policies are key to ensuring that climate ambition remains both politically and socially sustainable.”“Business and industry have a crucial role to play in this transformation,” said Ricardo Mussa, Chair of Sustainable Business COP30 (SB COP). “Investing in green skills and workforce transformation is not just good for the planet — it’s good for business. By building the talent base for the low-carbon economy, companies can unlock new markets, strengthen supply chains, and deliver sustainable growth.”“We need a coordinated, whole-of-economy approach with investments in skills and workforce development at the center,” said Dr. Liesbet Steer, Executive Director at Systemiq and lead author of the report. “Our report shows that a people-centered transition can deliver a powerful triple dividend — stronger economies, greater social cohesion, and faster environmental progress.”&nbsp;“The transition to a low-carbon economy will only succeed if people are positioned to benefit from it and equipped to drive it forward,” said Ani Dasgupta, President &amp; CEO of WRI. “By investing in people’s skills and potential, we turn the challenge of decarbonization into an engine for growth and shared prosperity.”“Skills shortages put global climate goals at risk. There can be no climate transition without a skills transition,” said Ingrid-Gabriela Hoven, Managing Director at GIZ. “Accelerating green jobs and skills will yield a triple dividend: stronger and more resilient economies, more social cohesion, and faster progress to a low-carbon economy.”“Philanthropy and private investors are key to unlocking the potential of the new economy,” said Michelle Armstrong, Managing Director at Ares Management and President of the Ares Charitable Foundation. “Catalytic investments in people’s skills, resilience and potential can help empower communities, expand access to good jobs, and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”\\"As countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the right tools and partnerships are essential to build capacity for climate innovation — unlocking the social and economic transformation these commitments aim to deliver,\\" said Pablo Vieira, Global Director of the NDC Partnership. \\"The Global Initiative on Jobs &amp; Skills for the New Economy will play a key role in expanding this support, helping countries fast-track NDC implementation and investment for a green and just transition.”To learn more about the new research, visit https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/PUBLICATION2227-1.The new research was directed by Systemiq and World Resources Institute. The research was financially supported by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) through the GIZ-implemented Climate Diplomacy Action Programme on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUKN). Further significant contributions were provided by Ares Charitable Foundation and the NDC Partnership.
