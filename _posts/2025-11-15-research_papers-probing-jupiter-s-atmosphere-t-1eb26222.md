Abstract The upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere, offering critical insights into the planet's deeper structure, are accessible through radio occultation experiments. Since July 2023, NASA's Juno extended mission has provided the first high‐resolution radio occultation measurements since the Voyager era, probing the thermal structure and composition down to approximately 0.5 bar. We use these measurements to study Jupiter's latitudinally dependent vertical thermal structure. We observe cooler stratospheric and warmer tropospheric temperatures at the equatorial region compared to mid‐ and high‐latitudes, and temporal variations in the North Equatorial Belt's thermal structure on a time scale of a few months. These observations align with archival mid‐infrared data from Cassini's CIRS and current ground‐based Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph observations, as well as previous studies based on Voyager radio occultations and the Galileo probe, offering an enhanced view of Jupiter's lower stratosphere and upper troposphere thermal structure.
