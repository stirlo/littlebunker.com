Nature Climate Change, Published online: 13 June 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02356-4Fire emissions can be an important source of nutrients such as iron, particularly for the oceans. Here the authors estimate that climate-change-driven changes in fire emissions could increase iron deposition in ocean ecosystems, enhancing productivity particularly in the North Atlantic.
