Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and major stratospheric ozone‐depleting compound. While 30% of global N2O emissions are attributed to the oceans, there are still large uncertainties partly due to sparse data coverage. The eastern tropical Indian Ocean is an under‐sampled area which potentially acts as a source of atmospheric N2O. In this study, we present the most comprehensive, high‐resolution survey of surface water N2O concentrations and air‐sea fluxes in the region to date, spanning the equatorial area as well as open and near‐coastal waters of Bay of Bengal. We show significant spatial and temporal variability in N2O concentrations driven by upwelling, riverine inputs and monsoonal influence. The northern Bay of Bengal was identified as a hotspot for N2O emissions, while salinity‐driven stratification limited emissions in other areas. Overall, the Bay of Bengal contributes 0.9%–1.5% to global oceanic N2O emissions.
