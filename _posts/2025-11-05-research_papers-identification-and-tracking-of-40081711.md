Abstract Deep convection systems (DCSs) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surrounding areas (SA) with full lifecycle have yet to be continuously tracked, and variations in DCS properties remain insufficiently explored. This study employs all‐day cloud physical properties to automatically identify and track DCSs in summer. The results show that, influenced by factors such as summer monsoon, topography, and solar radiation, the diurnal variation of DCS number follows a unimodal pattern, with a phase difference of approximately 2 hr between the two areas. Additionally, diurnal variation in cloud properties of DCSs and their internal regions is revealed for the first time. Quantitative analysis of the DCS properties with different sizes and lifetimes indicates that both the TP and SA are dominated by small‐sized DCS with initial DCS lifetimes under 6 hr. These discoveries provide valuable insights into understanding the development and evolution of DCSs and their climatic effects.
