Abstract Hot droughts, or compound drought and heatwaves, have a significant impact on arid regions in southwestern North America (SWNA). In the summer of 2023, SWNA experienced unusually intense hot droughts during both the daytime and nighttime, with their severity amplified three to five times above values during the prior four decades. Over this period, a significant increase was found in the coupling between nighttime and daytime conditions at local scales and across different regions of the SWNA. The hot drought was due to a suppressed North American monsoon (NAM) in response to synoptic‐scale subsidence and moisture divergence. Nevertheless, we identified a remote connection between soil moisture in upwind areas and hot drought conditions in downwind regions across the US‐Mexico border. Our findings indicate that hot droughts need to be analyzed over complete diurnal cycles and over regions that are connected through atmospheric pathways to improve their prediction, response, and mitigation.
