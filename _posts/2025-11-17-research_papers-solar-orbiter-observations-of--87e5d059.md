Abstract Magnetic holes (MHs) are localized structures characterized by magnetic field depressions, accompanied by an enhancement in plasma thermal pressure. These pressure‐balanced structures span a broad range of scales in space, from fluid to kinetic regimes. The kinetic‐scale MHs are ubiquitous in the solar wind; however, the exploration is limited due to the lack of high‐resolution particle measurements. Here, we utilize Solar Orbiter observations to explore ion dynamics within an ion‐scale MH. The ion energy spectrum exhibits enhanced and depressed phase‐space densities for ions above and below 10 eV, respectively. The enhancements of perpendicular and parallel temperatures in this deep MH result in a quasi‐isotropic ion pitch angle distribution. The ion diamagnetic drift contributes to the agyrotropy around the boundaries, forming an ion vortex consistent with the magnetic field depression. These results align well with a kinetic equilibrium model, confirming the stability and self‐consistency of ion‐scale MHs in the solar wind.
