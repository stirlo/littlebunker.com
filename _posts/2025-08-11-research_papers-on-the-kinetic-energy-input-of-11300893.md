Abstract Magnetosheath jets, plasma structures with enhanced dynamic pressure, are frequently observed in the terrestrial magnetosheath. However, their mass, momentum, and energy content are still unknown. We utilize Amitis, a 3D hybrid‐kinetic plasma simulation, to study the mass, momentum, and energy content of jets in the subsolar magnetosheath. We also analyze the kinetic, thermal, and electromagnetic energy flux associated with jets. Jets comprise up to 21% of the quasi‐parallel magnetosheath and can carry up to half of the kinetic energy. Furthermore, jets convert kinetic energy to thermal energy. Our hybrid simulations also suggest that while jets can form downstream of the quasi‐perpendicular shock, their volume and energy content are much small compared to jets downstream of the quasi‐parallel bow shock. We conclude that magnetosheath jets play a vital role in heating up the magnetosheath and significantly influence the dynamics of the quasi‐parallel magnetosheath.
