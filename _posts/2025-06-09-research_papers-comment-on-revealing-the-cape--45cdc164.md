Abstract Tao et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024gl110777) propose that the Cape Verde hotspot influenced lithospheric structures and the geological evolution of the Great Lakes region, ultimately shaping the modern‐day Great Lakes. However, their interpretation conflicts with other observations. Pre‐Mesozoic tectonic features including the Palaeozoic Michigan Basin and major structural zones predate any proposed Mesozoic hotspot and likely controlled basin formation. Tao et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024gl110777)'s interpretation of a seismic anisotropy anomaly as the remnants of a hotspot track is non‐unique, and inconsistent with a linear hotspot track. Different Atlantic hotspot reconstructions predict widespread plume tracks across North America, making the approach unreliable for constraining regional geodynamics. Prior studies that conclude glacial erosion exploiting pre‐existing tectonic structures offer a more robust and testable explanation for Great Lakes formation.
