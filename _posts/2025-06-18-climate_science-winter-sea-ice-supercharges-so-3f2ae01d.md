A breakthrough study has uncovered that the Southern Ocean's power to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere fluctuates dramatically depending on winter sea ice. When sea ice lingers longer into winter, the ocean absorbs up to 20% more CO2, thanks to a protective effect that blocks turbulent winds from stirring up deeper, carbon-loaded waters. This subtle seasonal shield plays a vital role in buffering our planet against climate change. But here s the twist: winter data from the Southern Ocean is notoriously scarce due to its brutal conditions, meaning we might be missing a key piece of Earth s climate puzzle.
