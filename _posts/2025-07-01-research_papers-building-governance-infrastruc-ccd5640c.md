Low-cost air quality sensor networks have gained tremendous popularity in the past decade, and they are increasingly being used for air quality related research and public outreach. They are also being used by different levels of governments as a governance tool to handle the ‘wicked’ problem of ambient air pollution. The smart and trustworthy air quality network is a multi-disciplinary, large-scale, low-cost sensor network designed for air quality, cybersecurity, and public administration research purposes for the Orlando, FL area. The custom designed monitors measure fine and coarse particulate matter at 2 min intervals across an approximately 30 km by 60 km area. In this article, we describe the establishment of two interlinked networks: one technological and one human-focused following a community-engaged research approach. In this paper, we explain design elements of both sides of the network and reflect on how well the outcomes achieved the principles of our design. Information presented in this article will inform other researchers who wish to operate their own low-cost sensor networks utilizing community-centered science and collaborative design for research purposes.
