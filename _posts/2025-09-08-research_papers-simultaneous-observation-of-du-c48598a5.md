Abstract The duskside and dawnside subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) refer to high‐velocity westward and eastward plasma flows located equatorward of the auroral oval. While extensive research has focused on the duskside SAPS, the simultaneous evolution of both dawnside and duskside SAPS remains unreported. In this study, for the first time, we investigated the simultaneous evolution of duskside and dawnside SAPS using multiple Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars during an intense storm. Observations indicate that the duskside SAPS exhibits a wider magnetic local time extension (∼7 MLT) and longer duration (∼1 hr) than the dawnside SAPS. Furthermore, the duskside SAPS resides within low‐density mid‐latitude troughs, whereas the dawnside SAPS is not located within the trough. The dawnside SAPS exhibits significantly higher electron density but comparable velocity to the duskside SAPS. These findings highlight the distinct evolution of dawnside and duskside SAPS, providing new insights into the electrodynamic processes of subauroral ionosphere and magnetosphere coupling.
