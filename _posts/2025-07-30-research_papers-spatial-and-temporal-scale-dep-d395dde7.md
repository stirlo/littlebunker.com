Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 30, July 2025. SignificanceAn intriguing phenomenon is the capability of biota to form striking self-organized spatial patterns. Biocrusts serve as the soil’s skin and have different morphology and life history as compared to plant communities. We investigated these ...
