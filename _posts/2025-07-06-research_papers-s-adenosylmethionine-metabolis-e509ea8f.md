Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceS-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism is crucial for diverse functions, mediated through methylation. Although the feedback regulation of SAM production has been explored extensively, our understanding of the mechanism behind SAM consumption ...
