Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceIn this work, we elucidate the signaling interaction between abscisic acid (ABA), classically known for its function as a plant abiotic stress hormone, and ROP GTPases, regulators of cell polarity, in xylem differentiation and cell wall ...
