Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 46, November 2025. SignificanceHere we describe the structure and development ofXenopusfemale germline cells and show their development begins with a germline stem cell (GSC). These distinctive cells selectively express genes likepiwil4and neuronal genes such aschgb, ...
