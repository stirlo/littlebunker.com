Ancient river landscapes buried beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have been uncovered by radar, revealing vast, flat surfaces formed over 80 million years ago before Antarctica froze. These hidden features, stretching across 3,500 kilometers, are now acting as natural brakes on glacier flow, potentially moderating current ice loss. Their discovery adds a new piece to the puzzle of Earth's climate history and could help scientists better forecast how this enormous ice sheet will behave as the planet warms.
