Abstract The melting of sea ice in the Arctic has sparked research into how clouds form in exposed ice‐free zones. This study delves into the seasonal distribution of stratocumulus clouds over the Norwegian Sea‐Barents Sea region and presents a conceptual model for the underlying mechanisms. In spring, autumn, and winter, increased surface water vapor flux provides water vapor from the sea surface. Concurrently, warm air enters the area through the southwest wind of the Norwegian Strait. Under conditions of unstable stratification, the water vapor is lifted to the condensation level, promoting the formation of stratocumulus clouds. Conversely, in summer, evaporation is suppressed due to stable stratification, which hinders vertical vapor transport. Enhanced dry advection reduces the transport of water vapor, leading to a decrease in the amount of stratocumulus clouds during summer. This research enriches our understanding of the physical mechanisms influencing cloud formation and cloud‐climate feedbacks in the Arctic region.
