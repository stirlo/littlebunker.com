Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 1, January 2026. SignificanceWe present a genomics-informed framework for evaluating when genetic rescue—introducing unrelated individuals to increase genetic diversity and reduce inbreeding—is likely to succeed. Our approach integrates genomic insights on inbreeding, ...
