Abstract In late 2023, the Amazon River Basin experienced its most extreme drought to date, putting its population and ecosystem at risk. Gauges that were still functioning measured the lowest river water levels (RWL) on record. Here, satellite observations, including Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT), reveal the spread and timing of extremely low RWL across the entire river system. The majority of Nadir altimeter observations show that the 2023 minimum RWL in the Central Amazon were 3 m or more below their annual average, representing two to three times its mean variability. Additionally, SWOT captures the basin‐scale reduction in RWL with a spatial resolution of 200 m and how it propagates with time. Large‐scale evaluation with gauges suggests that SWOT outperforms classical altimetry in estimating RWL, despites differences that need further investigations. SWOT offers a new opportunity to understand hydroclimatic extremes and their broad impacts on the environment of the Amazon.
