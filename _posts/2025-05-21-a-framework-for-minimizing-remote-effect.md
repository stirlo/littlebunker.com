Abstract
Climate interventions like Marine Cloud Brightening have gained attention for their potential to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from the worst impacts of climate change. Early modeling studies raised concerns about potential harmful global side effects stemming from regional interventions. Here we propose a modeling framework to evaluate these risks based on using maximal deployment scenarios in a global climate model to identify potential pathways of concern, combined with more realistic large intervention levels. We demonstrate this framework by modeling a cooling intervention over the Great Barrier Reef using the Community Earth System Model. We identify potential impacts on tropical convection that could produce remote impacts, and show that limiting intervention duration to deployment in the key season largely eliminates these risks. Overall we illustrate that the local ecological goals can be achieved at a level of cooling well below what poses a risk of significant remote effects.
