Addis Ababa University’s (AAU) Department of Economics, in collaboration with WRI, has successfully completed two phases of the Research Hub Program on systems thinking and green economic modeling. Supported through WRI’s National Climate Action (NCA) initiative, the program is building a strong foundation for Ethiopia’s next generation of climate and economic modelers.Over the past two years, this partnership has advanced AAU’s pioneering work in green-economy modeling and systems thinking. WRI worked closely with the university to develop a cutting-edge curriculum and train academic staff in system dynamics, equipping educators and researchers with tools to tackle Ethiopia’s complex climate and economic challenges.So far, 10 master’s students have received full scholarships to specialize in applied economic modeling relevant to policy and planning. Their research explores themes such as green employment, agricultural productivity, sustainable transport and urban waste management. They also received professional training alongside practitioners from key government institutions and participated in a series of academic seminars. These efforts are not only building expertise but also bridging the gap between policy and research. &nbsp;This initiative marks a significant step forward in embedding analytical and modeling capacity within Ethiopia’s higher education system to support national climate goals. By introducing the Green Economy Model into academic curriculum and applied research, AAU and WRI are equipping the country with stronger tools to design, assess and implement climate-resilient, low-carbon development strategies.The Research Hub has evolved into a national and regional center of excellence, bridging research, policy and practice. It is empowering a new generation of economists and climate analysts to work with the Ministry of Planning and Development (MoPD), the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and other institutions to implement Ethiopia’s 2050 net-zero vision. This collaboration underscores the transformative role universities can play in shaping national climate governance when research and policy are aligned.Through WRI’s partnership, AAU implemented a program that strengthened academic and professional skills in systems thinking and green economic modeling.Practitioners from MoPD, EPA and the Ministry of Finance joined the program’s advanced system dynamics training sessions, designed to improve cross-institutional collaboration and analytical and policy modeling skills.Through guest lectures and seminars, the Research Hub built a vibrant learning community of students, faculty and policymakers to explore how modeling can inform climate policy. Graduates presented their findings at a seminar hosted by WRI Ethiopia, receiving technical feedback from experts across different sectors. Building on this momentum, the AAU team presented the partnership at the second African Climate Summit as an example of how academic research can shape national and regional climate strategies. These engagements showcased the students’ achievements and reinforced AAU and WRI’s reputation as leaders in applied modeling for sustainable development.The AAU-WRI Research Hub demonstrates how long-term collaboration can strengthen institutional capacity and support evidence-based policymaking. It shows the key role local universities can play in generating data and research that directly guide government planning. By training people in modeling and analysis, the project helps ensure Ethiopia’s development decisions are based on sound evidence and measurable outcomes.As one faculty member noted, “This collaboration has not only trained experts, but it has also established a long-term foundation for climate modeling that will continue to serve Ethiopia’s policy processes for years to come.” This comment captures the essence of the project — capacity building, knowledge generation and sustainable impact.What’s Next?Building on these achievements, WRI and AAU aim to expand the Research Hub’s curriculum by introducing new modeling modules and aligning it with Ethiopia’s emerging Climate Data Hub — a tracking and monitoring system that feeds directly into Green Economy Model projections. The next phase will focus on developing a new group of master’s and doctoral researchers, strengthening the hub’s role as center for learning and innovation, and deepening collaboration between universities and government institutions.The upcoming work will also prioritize producing high-quality, policy-relevant research and improving access to data-driven tools for climate planning. Through the continued partnership, AAU and WRI aim to strengthen Ethiopia’s modeling and analytical capacity to better support the country's development goals.&nbsp;If you are interested in partnering with Addis Ababa University and WRI to build on and expand this work, please contact sara.ascher@wri.org.
