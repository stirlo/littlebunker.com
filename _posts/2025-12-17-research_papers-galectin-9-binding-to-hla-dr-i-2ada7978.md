Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. SignificanceThis research uncovers an important role for galectin-9 (gal9) in dendritic cells (DCs) during the engagement and subsequent activation of CD4+T cells, which is indispensable to initiate adaptive immunity. Gal9 expressed by DCs aids in the ...
