Abstract Northwest Pacific Ocean sedimentary eolian records preserve abundant information about the temporal evolution of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation. The large spatial scale of these wind systems means that they play key roles in driving dust transportation from inland areas to the open ocean. However, the altitudinal range of dominant wind systems that produce Northwest Pacific eolian records remains unclear on orbital timescales. To address this uncertainty, we conducted an integrated study of Northwest Pacific Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1210B eolian deposition between 1.5 and 1.0 Ma. Based on our reconstructed environmental magnetic, sedimentological, and geochemical records, modern observational analyses and paleoclimate model results, we propose that eolian variations at Hole 1210B mainly indicate stronger glacial mid‐tropospheric (∼300–500 hPa) wind intensities over the Northwest Pacific. These results improve our understanding of Northern Hemisphere wind system evolution over Northwest Pacific pelagic areas on glacial‐interglacial timescales.
