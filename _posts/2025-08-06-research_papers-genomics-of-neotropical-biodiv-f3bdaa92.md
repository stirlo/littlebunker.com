Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 31, August 2025. SignificanceUnderstanding factors contributing to rapid speciation is a key aim of evolutionary biology. Here, we focus on two rapid radiations of Neotropical butterflies. Our genomic data with broad taxonomic and geographic coverage reveal widespread ...
