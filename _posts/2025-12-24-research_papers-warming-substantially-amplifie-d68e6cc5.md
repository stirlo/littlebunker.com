Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 51, December 2025. SignificanceAntarctic coastal polynyas, small open-water areas within sea ice, are revealed in this study to be unexpectedly powerful carbon sinks. Despite covering just ~3% of the Southern Ocean, they bury 42% of its organic carbon, making them the ...
