Abstract This study investigates the roles of deep and shallow convection in shaping tropical gross moist stability (GMS) and its related quantities—gross dry stability (GDS) and gross moisture stratification (GQS)—under convective quasi‐equilibrium constraints. Using reanalysis data and a theoretical framework that separates the deep and shallow convective modes, we quantify their individual and combined contributions to energy and moisture transport. Results show that deep mode GDS and GQS are strongly correlated with sea surface temperature (SST). In contrast, GMS is much smaller and exhibits weaker SST dependence, particularly when the shallow mode is included. The deep mode generally stabilizes the atmosphere through moist static energy export, whereas the shallow mode destabilizes it through moist static energy import. When combined, GMS is positive over convective regions but negative or near‐neutral over subtropical oceans and cold tongue, and its spatial distribution closely corresponds to observed Madden–Julian Oscillation activity.
