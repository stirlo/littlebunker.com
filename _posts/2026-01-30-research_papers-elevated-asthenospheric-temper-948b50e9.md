Abstract The origin of a binary‐mixing of DM and EM1 sources for the Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in eastern Northeast China is yet unclear. Seismic attenuation imaging is a tool that can shed light on this question. Here we present the first map of teleseismic P‐wave attenuation across Northeast China. Three hundred eighty‐two teleseismic direct‐P phases are analyzed using a time‐domain waveform matching method and a 2‐D relative attenuation map is inverted by applying a Hierarchical Bayesian method. Strong attenuation is observed beneath Jingpohu volcano. The estimated asthenospheric Qp is abnormally low (Qp 4%) underneath Jingpohu volcano, presumably induced by hot mantle upwelling. Meanwhile, the hot asthenosphere could induce the melting of the bottom of the lithospheric mantle, and we infer that this lithospheric melting combined with the ascending asthenospheric melt may feed the Jingpohu volcanism, explaining the mixed‐source geochemical signature.
