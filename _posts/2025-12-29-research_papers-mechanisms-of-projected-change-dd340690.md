Abstract Responses of downdraft convective available potential energy (DCAPE) to global warming were investigated using the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) under a high‐emission scenario through the year 2100. DCAPE is projected to increase by 5%–12% on average in most areas, independently of wind shear. A diagnostic of downdraft buoyancy is introduced to understand the mechanisms of DCAPE responses. Much of the increase in mean DCAPE is temperature‐driven, with additional contributions from changes in relative humidity and downdraft origin heights. However, extreme values increase at much faster rates than can be explained by local warming. In winter, the latitude of significant DCAPE and CAPE shifts poleward by more than 5° due to larger changes in downburst environments within midlatitude cyclones. The projected increase in cold‐season extremes indicates an interaction between weather events and warming trends that increases the potential for downbursts and straight‐line winds in winter.
