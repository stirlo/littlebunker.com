Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 34, August 2025. SignificanceMicrotubules (MT) are polymers of α- and β-tubulins. Neurons employ a variety of mechanisms to regulate MTs for development and function. Individual neurons express multiple tubulin isotypes, yet how different tubulin isotypes cooperate to ...
