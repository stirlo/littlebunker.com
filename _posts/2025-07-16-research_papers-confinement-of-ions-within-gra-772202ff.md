Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceThe development of fluidic neuromorphic components and perceiving systems for emulating the function of biological nervous systems is imperative and challenging. This study introduces a graphene oxide ionic memristive device capable of ...
