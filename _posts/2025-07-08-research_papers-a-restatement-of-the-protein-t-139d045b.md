A protein transition is promoted as a pathway toward a sustainable food system, but its application and progress are potentially hindered by diverse, often conflicting narratives among various stakeholders. These narratives are constituted and underpinned by statements and nurture a growing polarisation by isolation of their underlying scientific evidence. The multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature of a protein transition does not go well with an isolated approach in academia. The latter leads to fragmented and incomplete scientific evidence that fails to fully grasp the complexity of the issue, while being used to form partial statements that feed societal and political debates. Through a Restatement approach, this paper aims to (i) synthesise scientific evidence from multiple academic disciplines related to a protein transition and (ii) critically reflect on the implications of the current fragmented scientific evidence landscape of a protein transition in academia and beyond. The Restatement is structured into three sections: Background, Context, and Impacts, with subsections that each cover 4â€“17 statements, with a total of 68 statements. We connected each statement to its supporting scientific evidence which revealed the complexity of how evidence is related and interpreted, in addition to the inconsistent use of terminology and resulting ambiguities. The main takeaway from the Restatement is that a protein transition cannot be reduced to a single message of a dietary shift but that it should be approached more holistically, while using the available evidence within the appropriate context and critical consideration of the methodologies used to obtain that evidence. This Restatement can be used by researchers and decision-makers working toward more sustainable food systems in the European Union and beyond, to understand the contexts and methods that are not within their own field of expertise. In addition, we stress that overcoming polarisation in a protein transition largely relies on critical reflections of the assumptions, interests and power dynamics shaping the protein transition debate.
