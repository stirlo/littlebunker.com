Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 35, September 2025. SignificanceActivin receptor-like kinase-2 interacts with two different classes of transforming growth factor Î² ligands: the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and the activins. With BMP ligands, ALK2 signals to play roles in bone modeling, while with ...
