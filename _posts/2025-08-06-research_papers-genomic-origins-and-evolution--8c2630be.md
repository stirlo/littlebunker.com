Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 31, August 2025. SignificanceIn many taxa, sex is determined by sex chromosomes that differ in size and content. Like the X and Y of mammals, the Z and W chromosomes of birds evolved from homologous autosomes so long ago that the early stages of the transition are lost to ...
