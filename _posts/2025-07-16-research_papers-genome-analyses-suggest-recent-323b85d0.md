Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceSpeciation is often driven by climatic fluctuations. Recent studies using whole genome data are shedding light on the process of speciation and the occurrence of postspeciation gene flow in mammalian taxa. Here, we present a genome assembly ...
