Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceChang’e-6 samples from the lunar farside could help resolve the origin of lunar asymmetry. High-precision isotopic analyses reveal that Chang’e-6 basalts are isotopically heavier in Fe and K than those from Apollo and Chang’e-5 missions. These ...
