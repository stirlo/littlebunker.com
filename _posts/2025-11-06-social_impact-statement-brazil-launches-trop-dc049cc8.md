Belem, Brazil (November 6, 2025) – Today, at the COP30 Leaders' Summit in Belém, the Brazilian COP30 presidency formally launched the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), a mechanism to provide&nbsp;long-term, predictable financing to countries that protect and sustainably manage their tropical forests.&nbsp;&nbsp;After initial contributions from Brazil, only Portugal and Norway have announced funding pledges so far, though almost 50 countries expressed support for the initiative. Brazil has set a $125 billion target for the TFFF, and aims to raise $10 billion initially from governments and philanthropies, which would spur further investments from private, corporate and philanthropic investors.&nbsp;Following is a statement from Mirela Sandrini, Interim Executive Director, WRI Brasil:&nbsp;“From the Amazon to the Congo to Southeast Asia, the forests that sustain us all are facing a&nbsp;global red alert. If enough countries contribute, this new mechanism could offer a breakthrough, flipping the economics of deforestation by making standing forests more profitable than clearing them.&nbsp;“The backing from almost 50 countries is encouraging and marks an important start for the TFFF, reflecting growing recognition of the need for collective action to protect and restore tropical forests. However, the pool of those that have actually committed funding so far remains limited. Broader support will be essential if the Facility is to become fully operational. It is the ultimate test of whether nations —&nbsp;especially wealthier ones —&nbsp;will recognize their shared responsibility for protecting the forests that underpin every economy on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;“As COP30 gets underway, new contributions in the coming days would be welcome news, strengthening the initial momentum.&nbsp;“The Facility will only work if it truly benefits the Indigenous Peoples and local communities who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The provision requiring 20% of payments to go to Indigenous Peoples and local communities is a strong start.&nbsp;“Raising money isn't enough, though. The next step is to design the operations manual, with transparent oversight and measures to prioritize and protect intact rainforests, while genuinely involving Indigenous Peoples and local communities. It must also deal with degradation – when forests are weakened by logging, mining or building roads – and leakage – where protecting one area simply shifts destruction elsewhere. Without that precision, the Facility risks being another good-intention promise, not a breakthrough.&nbsp;“Importantly, the TFFF is designed by and for the Global South, reflecting local realities and priorities. It sets a precedent for tropical countries to shape their own climate solutions while responsibly engaging global capital markets. This is not just another fund: it embodies the broader shifts our financial system needs — attracting existing capital toward smart, climate-positive, and secure investments.”&nbsp;
