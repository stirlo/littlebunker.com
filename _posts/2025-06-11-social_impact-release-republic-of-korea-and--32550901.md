Nice (June 12, 2025)&nbsp;— Today, the Republic of Korea and Panama became the first countries to officially join the 100% Alliance, committing to sustainably manage 100% of the ocean areas under their national jurisdictions. The announcement, made during the third UN Ocean Conference in Nice, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to protect ocean health and build a sustainable ocean economy.&nbsp;Led by Chile and France, in partnership with the Ocean Panel and coordinated by World Resources Institute (WRI), the 100% Alliance calls on all coastal and ocean states to commit to 100% sustainable ocean management of their national waters by 2030. This commitment supports Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water) and contributes to the 30x30 goal set out in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework to protect at least 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this move, the Republic of Korea, newly announced as co-hosts of the next UN Ocean Conference in 2028, continues to demonstrate strong ocean leadership. Hosting a successful Our Ocean Conference in Busan this April, the country launched its Blue Korea Action Plan, committing $2.65 billion across 76 ocean actions. Korea has also ratified the High Seas Treaty, solidifying its dedication to marine protection both within and beyond its jurisdiction.&nbsp;“The Republic of Korea has built strong experience managing competing ocean priorities — like conservation, fisheries, and development — through a coordinated national approach, established by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries,” said Sung-Bum Kim, Deputy Minister for Marine Policy. “We believe this foundation positions us to deliver a Sustainable Ocean Plan that not only supports our national goals but also offers meaningful guidance to other ocean nations around the world.”&nbsp;Panama has also made significant progress in marine protection, becoming the first Latin American country to protect over half of its national waters (54%) exceeding the goal 30x30 goal within its own territory well ahead of schedule. Last year, Panama was also among the first countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty.&nbsp;“Panama is proud to join the 100% Alliance, joining the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy in committing to 100% sustainable management of our national waters.” Said Juan Carlos Navarro, Panama’s Minister of Environment. “As a leader in ocean protection and marine biodiversity, Panama fully embraces the 100% goal through integrated, science-based policies. We are pleased to announce this commitment at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, and we encourage all nations to raise ambition to meet the urgent challenges facing our ocean and our planet.”&nbsp;The new 100% Alliance members will now commit to delivering Sustainable Ocean Plans (SOPs) — integrated strategies for sustainable ocean management. These plans are grounded in science and shaped through inclusive processes that engage local communities, Indigenous peoples and key sectors. They aim to protect biodiversity, enhance climate resilience, support sustainable livelihoods and advance ocean-based economies. Recognition of Sustainable Ocean Plans as a key framework for ocean governance has been reinforced in the&nbsp;UN Ocean Conference Political declaration, in documentation from&nbsp;56 Commonwealth nations and&nbsp;Pacific Island leaders, as well as by&nbsp;UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.&nbsp;The target for 100% sustainable management was first pioneered by the 18 member countries of the Ocean Panel, with eight having completed their Sustainable Ocean Plans, while the rest are in various stages of development or finalization.&nbsp;“The commitments from South Korea and Panama signal growing global momentum to put sustainability at the center of ocean governance,” said Dr Tom Pickerell, Global Director of World Resources Institute’s Ocean Program. “The way we manage the ocean must be as interconnected as the ocean itself — and we urge all coastal and ocean states to follow this ambitious lead.”&nbsp;\"39 percent of the ocean lies within national jurisdictions. That's why it is so vital that countries commit to sustainable management of their national waters through the 100% Alliance,\" said Julio Cordano, Chile's Director of Environment, Climate Change, and Oceans. \"We commend Republic of Korea and Panama for joining the commitment to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters and call on all ocean and coastal states to join this important goal.\"About 100% AllianceThe 100% Alliance calls on all coastal and ocean states to commit to sustainably manage 100% of ocean areas under national jurisdiction. Led by the governments of Chile and France, in partnership with the Ocean Panel, and coordinated by the World Resources Institute, the campaign will lead the charge for ambitious global action towards the UN Ocean Conference (9-13 June), and beyond.
