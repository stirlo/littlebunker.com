Sustainable resource management in the face of climate change is a pressing challenge for our society. This paper delves into the water-energy-food-ecosystems (WEFE) nexus, a scientific framework that supports the integrated assessment and management of the interconnected resources. Shifting from sectoral to cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary perspectives, the WEFE nexus addresses interdependencies and interactions among water, energy, food, ecosystems, and climate. This paper focuses on the extended nexus, incorporating ecosystems as a fourth pillar, underscoring the importance of considering ecosystems on an equal footing with water, energy, and food sectors. In addition, the paper emphasizes the significance of monitoring and modelling techniques, laying the foundations for understanding the nexus complexities and assessing uncertainty. The paper offers an overview of integrated nexus modelling, system analysis and socio-economic modelling, bridging the gap between nexus science and practice. It highlights the role of multifaceted stakeholder engagement methods, policy assessment, and institutional analysis in nexus models. Quantifying the nexus through indicators, and its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, EU Green Deal, and EU Blue Deal are also key focal points. Finally, the last part of the paper addresses challenges in existing nexus modelling attempts, advocates for the integration of transdisciplinary information, and presents lessons learned. The paper concludes with recommendations for the future of the WEFE nexus, emphasizing its potential in fostering transformative change toward sustainable resource management and inclusive policymaking.
