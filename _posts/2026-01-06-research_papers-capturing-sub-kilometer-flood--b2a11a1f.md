Abstract The severe impacts of rain‐on‐snow (ROS) extreme events have been widely recognized and studied. However, unlike hydrological processes, flood inundation dynamics and the relative contribution of rainfall and snowmelt during ROS events remain under‐investigated. We diagnosed and documented sub‐kilometer spatio‐temporal dynamics of flood inundation during the 2017 California ROS events, simulated by a 2‐dimensional hydrodynamic model, River Dynamical Core (RDycore). RDycore shows good performance in capturing fine‐scale flood inundation dynamics against gauge measurements (with a median correlation coefficient of 0.81) and satellite observations. On top of rainfall, snowmelt not only increases the mean maximum inundation depth (12.0%–25.1%), but also expands the total flooded area (19.9%–31.9%) and prolongs the mean flood duration (3.4%–7.1%) across the events. Our findings offer an explicit and accurate picture of when and where ROS flooding could occur and how snowmelt increases flood hazard, valuable for risk assessment and infrastructure planning.
