In contrast to COP30’s disappointing outcomes on finance, adaptation and fossil fuel transition, governments in Belém agreed to an ambitious Just Transition package. It combines the strongest language on rights and inclusion yet seen in the UN climate process with a new global mechanism to support countries reshaping their economies in a cleaner and fairer way. Delegates described the win as a rare convergence of political will, technical facilitation and years of groundwork by civil society. For Indian women workers, a just transition means surviving climate impacts with dignity “This decision brings the highest level of commitment we’ve ever seen on rights, inclusion and cooperation in climate planning,” said Anabella Rosemberg, Just Transition lead at Climate Action Network International. “In a COP where many other rooms were struggling, this shows what is possible when the people who have been carrying Just Transition for years finally get heard.” Civil society kept the issue alive The work programme on Just Transition, launched in 2022, remained low-profile across several COP cycles. During that time, unions, youth networks, feminist groups, Indigenous advocates and NGOs continued refining their proposals and pushing negotiators even when political attention was limited. As momentum built toward COP30 this year, these groups began referring to their proposal as the Belém Action Mechanism &#8211; the “BAM” &#8211; signalling the level of institutional ambition they believed the process required. “There would be no Just Transition mechanism without civil society,” Rosemberg said. She noted how different groups kept the issue alive over the past three years &#8211; drafting text, feeding ideas into consultations, and staging actions &#8211; from June’s ‘picketnic’ in Bonn to demonstrations in Belém. “The strongest rights and inclusion language ever agreed at a COP comes directly from that sustained work,” she added. Governments shifted faster than expected A key moment arrived on day two of COP30, when the G77+China group of developing countries signalled its support for establishing a Just Transition mechanism. Negotiators from several regions described this as the turning point that made an ambitious outcome possible. This was followed by the EU at the end of the first week and then by the UK. Behind the scenes, civil society groups in Canada, Australia and Switzerland pushed their governments to align with the emerging consensus. COP30: Spain’s unions say just transition means renewing communities beyond jobs Facilitators and ministers closed the gaps The technical co-facilitators of talks on the Just Transition Work Programme, Joseph Teo (of Singapore) and Federica Fricano (Italy), were credited with producing a clear, workable draft text that helped bridge divides. Delegates said its readability &#8211; unusual for UNFCCC text &#8211; helped maintain trust. Last year at COP29 in Baku, the Just Transition track of the negotiations ended without an outcome, partly because no ministers were mandated to land one. Belém took a different approach: Mexico’s Alicia Bárcena and Poland’s Krzysztof Bolesta were appointed as ministerial leads and played a central role in balancing strong rights language with the institutional detail needed to implement it. UNFCCC secretariat staff supported the process with rapid revision work through the second week. Brazil’s presidency and the significance of place As the COP host nation, Brazil made Just Transition one of its three priorities, ensuring the track remained visible amid wider disputes. The presidency directed parties toward “institutional arrangements” &#8211; the diplomatic route that made a mechanism possible. Belém’s context also mattered. The region is a long-standing focal point for debates around livelihoods, extractivism of natural resources and environmental protection, grounding the negotiations in a real-world context. “Water is worth more than lithium,” Indigenous Argentine community tells COP30 “Brazil was the right place for this breakthrough,” Rosemberg said. “Here the tension between social protection and environmental protection is lived, not abstract. A mechanism agreed in the land of trade unionist and environmentalist Chico Mendes &#8211; that means something.” What the Just Transition decision changes The final text approved at COP30 sets out principles for rights-based, inclusive transitions and decides to develop a global mechanism to support countries in implementing those principles &#8211; elevating it to a structural component of how climate action will be delivered in the Paris Agreement era. The mechanism is due to be operationalised at COP31 next November. The COP30 agreement also reinforces the expectation that social and economic dimensions must be central to national climate plans, not appended to them. The work starts now The mechanism’s impact will depend on the operational details agreed by governments in the months ahead. Key questions include the design of the mechanism’s committee, what form secretariat support will take, and whether civil society and trade unions will have a formal role in its work. Parties also need to decide whether the mechanism should help convene a wider network of practitioners. Its first workplan, the identification of support needs, and clarification of how it will interact with existing UNFCCC bodies will shape how effective it becomes &#8211; decisions that are expected to be taken at COP31. A just transition for renewables: Why COP30 must put people before power “What comes next is making sure this mechanism speaks to reality,” Rosemberg said. “It has to work for workers facing job loss, for communities left out of climate decisions, and for governments trying to shift economies away from extractivism. If those voices shape it, this can be an eye-opener rather than a repetition of old conversations.” Social justice at the forefront COP30 will likely be remembered for its unresolved debates and for outcomes that fell short in areas many countries consider essential. Against that backdrop, the Just Transition decision stands out as a rare instance of coordination between civil society, governments and the presidency. It marks the first time the UN climate process has created an institutional structure dedicated to ensuring that social and economic justice is embedded in the shift away from fossil fuels and other high-carbon sectors that must change. The Just Transition outcome may not resolve the broader challenges faced by the UN climate process, but it establishes a foundation that many negotiators and observers say could shape climate policy for the better in the years to come.
