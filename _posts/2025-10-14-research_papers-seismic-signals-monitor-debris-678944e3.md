Abstract Channel erosion not only amplifies debris‐flow magnitude and impact but also reshapes local geomorphology. However, the destructive and infrequent nature of debris flows makes in situ monitoring of channel‐bed erosion processes and flow characteristics challenging. Here, we investigate seismic signals for monitoring erosion‐driven geomorphic changes, using data from 18 well‐documented debris flows at Illgraben, Switzerland, between 2019 and 2023. We find that integrated seismically derived impact forces over each event correlate with channel‐bed elevation changes, revealing erosion thresholds. Seismic peak frequencies correlate with absolute channel‐bed elevations at seismic source regions, reflecting changes in wave propagation paths due to erosion. The correlation is evident, with peak frequency shifts exceeding 15 Hz while channel‐bed elevation changes were under 4 m during the 5‐year period. These findings demonstrate the capacity of seismic signals to characterize debris‐flow erosion and track absolute channel‐bed elevations, offering new insights into geomorphic processes.
