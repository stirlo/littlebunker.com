Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceOur findings unveil insights into the role of BMP-9, encoded by theGDF2gene, in maintaining pulmonary vascular health and mitigating pulmonary hypertension (PH). We demonstrate thatGdf2KO rats exhibit augmented pulmonary vascular density ...
