Nature Climate Change, Published online: 27 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02496-7The authors model near-ground and within-canopy microclimates in a tropical montane rainforest. They show that short-distance shifts towards dense vegetation or vertically downwards in canopies reduce velocities, highlighting that structurally complex ecosystems may provide short-term climate refuges.
