Abstract The inverted tripole charge structure in thunderstorm over the central Tibetan Plateau was discovered for the first time, primarily through observations from lightning very high frequency interferometer capable of high‐precision lightning channel mapping. The dominant cell exhibited an inverted tripole charge structure initially, characterized by a negative charge region at temperatures near 0°C, a main positive charge region between −30°C and −5°C, and an upper negative charge region at T −20°C). Throughout this thunderstorm, no positive cloud‐to‐ground (+CG) flashes were detected, while five −CG flashes were recorded. Among 109 intracloud (IC) flashes detected, 90% occurred between the upper inverted dipole. Radar reflectivity showed that this thunderstorm was more intense than conventional plateau thunderstorms.
