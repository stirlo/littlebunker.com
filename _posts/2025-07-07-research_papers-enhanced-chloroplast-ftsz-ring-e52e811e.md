Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceDuring plant growth, the demand for energy necessitates an increase in the number of chloroplasts. This increase is achieved through chloroplast division, which begins with the formation of the stromal FtsZ ring (Z ring). The dynamics and ...
