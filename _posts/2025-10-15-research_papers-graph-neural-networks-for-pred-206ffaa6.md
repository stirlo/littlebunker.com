Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 41, October 2025. SignificanceTransition metal complexes (TMCs) are of great scientific and practical interest for applications in catalysis, biological systems, photochemistry, and sustainability, with properties highly dependent on the binding between their constituent ...
