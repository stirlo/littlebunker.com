Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 34, August 2025. SignificanceOxygen homeostasis in complex animals requires multiple sensory mechanisms to integrate cell-autonomous actions with tissue- and system-wide feedback circuits. 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO)-catalyzed N-degron proteolysis is rapid, ...
