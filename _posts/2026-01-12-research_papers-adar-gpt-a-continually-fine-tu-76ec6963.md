Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceA-to-I RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes reshapes the transcriptome and holds great promise for therapeutic RNA design, yet identifying which adenosines are edited remains a central challenge. We present Adar-GPT,...
