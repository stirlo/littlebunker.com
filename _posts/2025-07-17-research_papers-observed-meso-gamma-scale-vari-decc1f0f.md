Abstract The meso‐gamma scale variability of air‐sea sensible heat flux HS $\\text{HS}$ was investigated using synchronized flux observations from two tower‐based platforms within 10 km over coastal regions. Observations revealed statistically weak correlations between spatial HS $\\text{HS}$ variability and both 10 m wind speed U10 ${U}_{10}$ and air‐sea temperature difference ∆T $\\mathit{% raw %}{{\\increment}}{% endraw %}T$. While U10 ${U}_{10}$ roughly consistent between the two stations, significant ∆T $\\mathit{% raw %}{{\\increment}}{% endraw %}T$ discrepancies emerged, particularly along the parallel line connecting the two sites. Despite occasional variations at specific measurement points or times, the HS $\\text{HS}$ characteristics demonstrated statistical consistency between the two stations. Comparative analysis with the bulk algorithm indicated that bulk HS $\\text{HS}$ differences could partially explain observed ∆T $\\mathit{% raw %}{{\\increment}}{% endraw %}T$ variations. However, observed HS $\\text{HS}$ magnitudes substantially exceeded bulk estimates, and the heat flux exchange coefficients derived from observations differ by 1.6 times between the two stations. These findings highlight the necessity for enhanced high‐resolution direct flux measurements to validate parameterization schemes.
