Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceSolar-driven ammonia synthesis is an interesting approach to consider for fertilizer production and zero-carbon fuels. However, photocatalytic nitrogen fixation by well-defined synthetic catalysts was first demonstrated only very recently. Our ...
