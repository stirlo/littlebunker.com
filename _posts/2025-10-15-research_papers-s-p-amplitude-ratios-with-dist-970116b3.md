Abstract Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), which transforms a fiber optic cable into an array of high frequency strainmeters, has the potential to help us characterize earthquakes with a dense sampling of measurements. While earthquake focal mechanisms are frequently determined using P‐wave polarities and S/P amplitude ratios with inertial seismometers, the dense sampling of DAS over potentially large portions of the focal sphere can aid our solutions. Here, we consider ∼200 regional earthquakes and thousands of S/P measurements on a DAS cable colocated with a network of inertial seismometers near Arcata, California. We demonstrate the S/P ratio measurements made on DAS are similar to those made on the inertial seismometers and can be used to constrain focal mechanism solutions.
