Abstract On 28 March 2025, a Mw 7.7 earthquake occurred on the Sagaing Fault in Myanmar. Security constraints prevented timely field investigations on its surface rupture, hindering analysis of seismotectonics and rupture dynamics. Using high‐resolution satellite imagery, we mapped a ∼420 km surface rupture and measured 540 dextral offsets, revealing an average slip of 2.7 m and a maximum of 5.6 m. The rupture consists of two sections separated by a low‐slip‐zone that aligns with the refined epicenter and a previously unmapped stepover, suggesting the earthquake most likely nucleated at this structure and then propagate bilaterally. The rupture extends beyond the known seismic gap and overlaps with some recent historical rupture, highlighting contrasting earthquake recurrence cycles along different fault sections. Our mapping provides essential documentation of an ultra‐long, multi‐segment rupture on a major continental strike‐slip fault under restricted field access, offering critical insights into the rupture behavior of similar faults worldwide.
