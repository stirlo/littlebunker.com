Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 23, June 2025. SignificanceFerroelectricity is an important characteristic of two-dimensional (2D)/layered materials. In 2D crystals, the underlying mechanism is evidently linked to the single-layer structure. In contrast, layered (van der Waals) ferroelectrics can have ...
