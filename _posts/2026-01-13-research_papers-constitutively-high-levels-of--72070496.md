Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceIL-33-membrane-bound ST2 (ST2L) signals regulate various biological processes, including inflammation, infection, and tissue homeostasis. Based on previous studies using ST2-Fc, a mimicry of soluble ST2 (sST2), sST2 is thought to be a decoy ...
