Nature Climate Change, Published online: 05 December 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02487-8Methane emissions have a large short-term impact on temperature, which can be potentially offset by nature-based solutions that provide temporary carbon storage. This research demonstrates such matching could minimize intertemporal welfare trade-offs and avoid various risks for permanent removal.
