Manufactured home communities in the US Mountain West face increasing amounts of exposure to wildfire smoke, magnifying existing environmental health disparities. This study explores a co-creation approach to air quality messaging that is grounded in social cognitive theory and draws from environmental communication research. We examined how manufactured home community experiences, across eight distinct communities, shape the development of localized air quality information, and how self-efficacy and outcome expectations influence information-sharing behaviors. Through a series of focus groups (n = 23) during the 2024 wildfire smoke season, we found co-creation strengthened community engagement by incorporating trusted communication networks and culturally relevant messaging. However, message fatigue and climate burnout presented challenges, highlighting the need for adaptive communication strategies. We discuss implications for designing sustainable and locally relevant air quality communication.
