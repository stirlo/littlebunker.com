Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 51, December 2025. SignificanceA substantial proportion of cochlear implant (CI) users—nearly 30%—derive limited benefit from the device, and the neural factors underlying this variability remain poorly understood. This study introduces an approach by analyzing the brain’s ...
