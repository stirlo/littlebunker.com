Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 39, September 2025. Human monogenic traits can confer resistance to viral infection in exposed individuals or predisposition to severe disease in infected individuals. Enhanced susceptibility can be driven directly by mutations in genes essential for control of the virus or ...
