Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 23, June 2025. SignificanceIron is an essential nutrient for phytoplankton photosynthesis, but its low solubility in seawater makes large regions prone to iron limitation, a state where exogenous iron input can increase photosynthesis, primary production, and carbon ...
