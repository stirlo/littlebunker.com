Nature Climate Change, Published online: 24 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02504-wThe authors theoretically delineate the maximal increases in tree growth that can be expected from increases in plant intrinsic water-use efficiency, which increases with rising CO2. They highlight environmental and physiological limits on growth in the context of experimental data.
