Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceElectronegativity usually decreases with increasing pressure, but its changes during pressure-induced Liquidâ€“liquid phase transitions (LLPTs) have been largely overlooked. This research explores how electronegativity can introduce a dimension ...
