Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 43, October 2025. SignificanceThis study addresses the contribution of mutant p53 to the process of cancer cell dissemination in physiologically relevant three-dimensional environments—a key characteristic of metastatic disease. Several mutant p53 proteins display pro-...
