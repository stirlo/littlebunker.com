Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 25, June 2025. SignificanceThe overall rarity of carbonate deposits on Mars have been interpreted to be the result of acid dissolution. We show that siderite is stable in Mars-relevant fluids from pH 7 to 2 and its alteration to ferric mineralsâ€”similar to those recently ...
