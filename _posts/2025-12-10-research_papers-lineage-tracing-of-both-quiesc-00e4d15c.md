Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceProspectively isolated HSCs regenerate long-term hematopoiesis via transplantation in irradiated hosts. Hoxb5 is expressed only in LT-HSCs. In this study, LT-HSCs are the first cells labeled by Hoxb5 lineage tracing and actively participate in ...
