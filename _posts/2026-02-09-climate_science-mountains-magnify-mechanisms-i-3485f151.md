Nature Climate Change, Published online: 09 February 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02549-xMountains, with their sharp climatic contrasts, are emblematic of climate-driven species movement and, ultimately, loss. Here, we argue that these same contrasts make mountains powerful natural laboratories for discovering the mechanisms that underlie biological change.
