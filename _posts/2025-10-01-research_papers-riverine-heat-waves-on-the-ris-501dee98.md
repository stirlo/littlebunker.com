Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 39, September 2025. SignificanceRiverine heat wave events—periods of abnormally high riverine water temperatures (WT)—can substantially impair aquatic ecosystems, water quality, and food and energy production. However, comprehensive analysis of riverine heat waves is still ...
