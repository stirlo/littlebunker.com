Abstract Lakes are experiencing ice declines and fundamental changes in winter conditions. For Earth's largest lakes that experience seasonal ice cover, the relationship between ice conditions and evaporation is critical to water balance estimates and global freshwater storage. Here, we analyze robust data sets of net basin supplies, satellite‐derived products, and model estimates of surface turbulent heat flux for the Laurentian Great Lakes during the period 1973–2022. We show that ice cover does not have a strong relationship with lake evaporation in winter months and that often the magnitude of the ice effect on moisture flux reduction is within the range of natural variability and the uncertainty of water budget estimates. This suggests that differences in lake evaporation between cold and warm winters is driven by seasonal overlake atmospheric conditions, more broadly, and that ice cover reduces but does not determine the resultant evaporation.
