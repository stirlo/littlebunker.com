Although precipitation increases have been observed in different areas of the globe and at various temporal resolutions, changes in precipitation can be difficult to detect and attribute to anthropogenic forcing in observational records due to the significant influence of natural variability. Here, we quantify the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation variability on total winter precipitation for Europe using dynamical adjustment with synoptic-scale weather patterns (WPs). Variability in atmospheric dynamics, through frequency changes in WPs, is shown to be a significant driver of observed wetting and drying trends, linked to observed trends in the North Atlantic jet stream. After removing dynamical variability, trends emerge in non-dynamical winter precipitation which are attributable to anthropogenic forcing: a north-south signal of a drying Mediterranean and increasingly wetter mid-to-high latitudes. Although this spatial pattern is well-represented by CMIP6 models, the magnitude of observed changes is approximately 23 years ahead of the CMIP6 multi-model mean predictions. Our results suggest that current adaptation strategies, based on multi-model means, may underestimate the near-term risk of climate-related hazards, and therefore require critical re-evaluation.
