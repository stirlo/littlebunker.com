Abstract This study examines inter‐decadal changes in the relationship between western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclone (TC) activity during the late season (October–December) and the simultaneous Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM). The relationship between late‐season WNP TC frequency and the PMM index has increased in recent decades. During 1951–1990, TC genesis is enhanced (suppressed) over the eastern (western) WNP during a positive PMM, due to the PMM's signal only extending from the subtropical northeastern Pacific to the eastern WNP. By contrast, during 1991–2023, a positive PMM leads to a basinwide enhancement of WNP TC genesis, due to PMM‐induced TC‐favorable environmental conditions expanding to the full WNP. This intensified PMM‐TC relationship is likely due to increased Intertropical Convergence Zone precipitation over the tropical eastern Pacific, which enhances northeasterly trade winds over the subtropical Pacific and subsequently strengthens the PMM.
