Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 46, November 2025. SignificanceNature-inspired materials are typically developed through either bio-based composition or structural biomimicry, but rarely both. Here, we present a unified approach that integrates these two strategies by combining diverse natural resources ...
