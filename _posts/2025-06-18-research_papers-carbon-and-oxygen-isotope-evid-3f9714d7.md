Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 24, June 2025. SignificanceRefractory organic solids are the dominant hosts of carbon and nitrogen in extraterrestrial materials and the major form of these elements that contributed to growing planets in the early solar system. We illustrate a striking relation between ...
