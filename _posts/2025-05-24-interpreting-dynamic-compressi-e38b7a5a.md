Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 20, May 2025. SignificanceWe present experiments in which liquid gallium is compressed to 0.3 million times atmospheric pressure within a few hundred nanoseconds. Because of this rapid compression, the gallium sample continues to remain as a metastable liquid at ...
