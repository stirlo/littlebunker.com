Abstract To investigate the environmental factors controlling the onset and maintenance of afternoon precipitation over tropical rainforests, two contrasting cases are created for large eddy simulations (LES) using GoAmazon observations: one features a single‐pulse rain dissipating quickly in earlier afternoon, while the other shows double pulses lasting until evening. For these two specific cases under consideration, LES confirms that early‐morning relative humidity dominates afternoon rain patterns. The attributed impacts are distinct: moisture determines the rain onset timing while temperature affects the peak rain intensity. Single‐pulse day observes one round of strong precipitation and cold pools, which further suppresses convection. On double‐pulse day, the first precipitation peak results from an intermediate development of congestus clouds, whose detrainment leads to a gradual moistening of the lower‐to‐middle troposphere. This behavior of convection favors a second pulse of stronger precipitation with more convective organization, whose development decouples from surface fluxes and sustains until evening.
