Abstract Juice (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) 3GM Radio Science Experiment will map the gravitational field of Ganymede with unprecedented accuracy and measure tidally‐induced variations. These measurements will allow the characterization of its putative ocean and may resolve lateral variations in internal structure. Lateral variations cause an additional tidal signal that depends on their wavelength and amplitude. We show that shell thickness variations of 10−100% $10-100\%$ the mean thickness produce an additional tidal signal ∼102−103 ${\sim} 1{0}^{2}-1{0}^{3}$ times smaller than the main tidal signal, detectable given the accuracy of Juice. Using a Bayesian framework, we show that measuring differences between k20 ${k}_{20}$ and k22 ${k}_{22}$ constrain equator to pole shell thickness differences. Also measuring the degree‐3 spherical harmonic signal due to degree 2 forcing constrain degree‐1 and degree‐3 structure. This demonstrates tidal tomography's potential to map three dimensional structure and supports its consideration for future missions.
