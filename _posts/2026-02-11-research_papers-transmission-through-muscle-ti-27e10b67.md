Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 6, February 2026. SignificanceMany animal tissues (e.g., muscle fibers and collagen) are translucent yet exhibit rich optical properties such as scattering and diffraction. In this study, we show that transparent muscle tissue in cuttlefish can actively shape visual ...
