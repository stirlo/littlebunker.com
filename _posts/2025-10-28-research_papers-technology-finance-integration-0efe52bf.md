This study examines the impact of the Pilot Programs of the Combination of Technology and Finance (PPCTF) on energy system resilience (ESR) in China, with particular attention to the moderating role of climate policy uncertainty (CPU). Using panel data from 280 cities during 2010–2022 and employing a double machine learning approach, we find that the PPCTF significantly enhances ESR, with robust results from various tests. The mediation effect reveals that RAO and green technology innovation are vital influential channels. Moreover, CPU amplifies the positive effect of the PPCTF on ESR, particularly in non-resource-based, strictly regulated, and high-governance cities. These findings highlight the importance of integrating technology and finance initiatives with climate policy considerations to foster sustainable and resilient energy systems. Policy implications are also discussed.
