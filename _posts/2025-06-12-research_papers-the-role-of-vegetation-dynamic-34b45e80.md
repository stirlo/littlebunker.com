Abstract Intensive irrigation in the North China Plain raises significant environmental concerns. While many studies have assessed the potential irrigation impact on regional climate, most have focused solely on water addition, neglecting the indirect effects of vegetation changes. This study evaluates how vegetation dynamics influence irrigation impacts. Three experimental scenarios—dynamic vegetation (DYNM), static bare vegetation (BARE), and static lush vegetation (LUSH)—demonstrate consistent precipitation increases in April‐May‐June, but significant inconsistencies arise in July‐August‐September. Two static vegetation scenarios deviate in opposite directions from DYNM in irrigation‐induced precipitation responses: DYNM indicates a slight decrease, LUSH shows a more pronounced decrease, while BARE presents a significant increase. These discrepancies stem from different magnitudes of irrigation‐induced evapotranspiration and cooling stabilization. Furthermore, deviations in the water and energy budget may introduce uncertainties in assessing broader irrigation impacts, such as groundwater depletion, which is often studied using static vegetation assumptions.
