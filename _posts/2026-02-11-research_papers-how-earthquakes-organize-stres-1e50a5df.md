Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 6, February 2026. SignificanceEarthquakes organize the stress in the crust by redistributing it through slip events. As a result, fault systems evolve to preferred, reproducible states as evidenced by natural experiments that measure statistical distributions of stress ...
