Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 41, October 2025. A distinguishing feature of the neural network models used in Physics and Chemistry is that they must obey basic underlying symmetries, such as symmetry to translations, rotations, and the exchange of identical particles. Over the course of the last ...
