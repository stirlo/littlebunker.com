Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 43, October 2025. SignificancePoint mutations in the Lamin A (LMNA) gene cause devastating human diseases that preferentially affect skeletal muscles and the heart. There is currently no cure for these conditions, and existing therapies are designed to mitigate the ...
