Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 46, November 2025. SignificanceBiomolecular condensation is emerging as a crucial process for cellular stress responses. Upon stress conditions, macroautophagy serves as a fundamental metabolic pathway by forming a double-membrane autophagosome. However, the initiation ...
