Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceLytic polysaccharide monooxygenases have evolved to use highly oxidizing copper species for C–H bond activation while avoiding damage from autooxidation. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction and site-directed mutagenesis of resurrected ...
