Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 33, August 2025. SignificanceGenetic deletion studies have revealed the diverse cellular, physiological, and pathophysiological roles of the mechanically activated PIEZO1 ion channel. However, whether these functions are directly mediated by its mechanosensitivity has ...
