Efforts to combat land degradation globally have led to the widespread promotion of sustainable land management practices (SLMPs) aimed at reducing surface runoff and erosion. Despite their extensive implementation, long-term evaluations of these practices are limited, especially in data-scarce regions. In our study, we assess the long-term impact of large-scale SLMPs in Ethiopia using remotely sensed data from the past 24 years on 122 watersheds. Using a synthetic control method that does not require an explicit control group, we find statistically significant positive effects of SLMPs in both wet and dry seasons. These benefits persist at least eight years beyond the intervention period. Our findings highlight the need for multi-season impact assessments. Focusing only on the wet season may overlook key outcomes in dryland regions, underestimating the effectiveness of large-scale, multi-year projects. We further find that effects were most positive in drought-prone agricultural highlands, and that some administrative zones appear more effective than others at implementation. Efficient and affordable monitoring of sustainable agricultural water and land management and watershed conservation is crucial for understanding which interventions are effective and can provide opportunities for alternative financing mechanisms.
