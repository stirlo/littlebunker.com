Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 45, November 2025. SignificanceLipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to the liver in people, but delivery to other tissues is challenging. Liver detargeting is important because it increases the availability of drug to deliver to other organs (e.g., the spleen). To produce lipid ...
