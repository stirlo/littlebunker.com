Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 27, July 2025. SignificanceLong-term monitoring of barystatic sea level (BSL) changes is essential for understanding the present-day global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. GMSL has been measured continuously by satellite altimetry since 1993, while BSL records based on ...
