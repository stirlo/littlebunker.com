Federal immigration raids and militarized enforcement are terrorizing our neighborhoods. Families are being torn apart. Communities are being destabilized. Human rights are being violated under systemic policies rooted in colonialism, racism, and xenophobia. Artwork by Javier Maldonado O’Farrill – AgitArte / Papel Machete @jmofarrill Across the country, our communities are rising up. People are refusing to stay silent in the face of authoritarian terror, violence, and fear. We are organizing, mobilizing, and demanding a liberated future rooted in dignity and justice. These attacks don’t exist in isolation. Poverty, racism, war, and climate change are deeply interconnected crises that shape people’s lives and force millions to leave their homes in search of safety and survival. Climate-driven droughts, floods, rising heat, and extreme weather are already displacing people worldwide and making entire regions unlivable. Borders do not stop climate collapse, and they should not be utilized to deny people their freedom, humanity, and dignity. Climate justice is inseparable from migrant justice. Both are rooted in a deep tradition of creating a just and livable future for everyone. Both demand collective, bold solutions led by frontline communities. Solutions that build a world where everyone can thrive. This is a moment to act — together. We call on our communities to get involved locally. Join or build mutual aid networks that support impacted families. Show up at protests and community meetings. Organize or participate in direct actions in your community. Boycott corporations that profit from detention and deportation. Call your members of Congress and demand an end to policies that criminalize migration and real action to dismantle systems of detention, deportation, including the abolition of ICE. We stand with migrant communities everywhere. We fight for dignity, safety, and freedom of movement for ALL PEOPLE. &nbsp; Artwork by Lane Lloyd @Coyotesnout Artwork by Jessica Thornton @jessicathorntondesigns Artwork by Willa Goettling @willakatrin Artwork by Aaron Hughes Artwork by Ryan Numair @ryannumair.art Artwork by Frank Riot @frank.riot Artwork from the Justseeds Artists’ Cooperative series of images opposing ICE.
