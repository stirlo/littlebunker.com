Abstract Analysis of 2 weeks of continuous post‐seismic shaking after the 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest, CA earthquake sequence using 4 nearby borehole seismometers reveals that continuous ground motions decay as Omori's law in time and follow the Gutenberg‐Richter distribution in logarithmic amplitude. The measured temporal decay in amplitudes agrees with predictions of the rate‐and‐state framework and indicates shaking amplitudes are proportional to the velocity of afterslip. Our ground motion‐based statistical framework provides a basis to forecast shaking intensity in the minutes to hours after a large earthquake.
