Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 23, June 2025. SignificanceUsing the CLIMBER-2 model to simulate the Plio–Pleistocene climate evolution, we find that for low (high) volcanic outgassing levels, the carbon system reorganizes itself such that atmospheric CO2is lower (higher), land carbon storage is low (...
