Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceThe theory of sex allocation has successfully predicted the sex ratios of species with separate sexes, but its assumption of a direct genetic trade-off between investment toward male versus female fitness has resisted empirical demonstration ...
