Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 30, July 2025. SignificanceUnderstanding how the amino acid sequence of a protein influences its ability to form biomolecular condensates is a fundamental challenge in biology. Yet, the molecular forces that govern this relationship remain incompletely understood. Here, ...
