Nature Climate Change, Published online: 27 August 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02411-0The authors assess the impacts of tropical deforestation and its subsequent local warming on human heat-related mortality. They estimate that deforestation-related warming (+0.27 Â°C) is associated with approximately 28,000 heat-related deaths per year.
