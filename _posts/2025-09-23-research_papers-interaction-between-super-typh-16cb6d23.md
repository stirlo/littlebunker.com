Statistical analyses have long suggested that the South China Sea (SCS) is generally unfavorable for super typhoons, primarily due to its shallow thermocline and the strong interaction between typhoon-induced near-inertial oscillations and internal tides, which enhance surface cooling and suppress storm intensification. However, the unprecedented case of Super Typhoon Yagi (2024) challenges this conventional understanding. Using satellite observations, reanalysis datasets, and numerical simulations, we show that a summer marine heatwave (MHW) in the northern SCS played a critical role in fueling Yagi’s rapid intensification and sustaining its super typhoon strength. Notably, the MHW was abruptly dissipated by Yagi’s wind-driven mixing. Further statistical analysis reveals that MHWs may serve as a necessary precondition for super typhoon development in the SCS, providing valuable predictive insights for anticipating future extreme events.
