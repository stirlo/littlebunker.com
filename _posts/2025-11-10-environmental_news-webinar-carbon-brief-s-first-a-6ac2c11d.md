As COP30 began in the Brazilian city of Belém, Carbon Brief hosted the first of three webinars to exclusively answer questions submitted by holders of the Insider Pass. Topics ranged from China’s priorities and the absence of the US through to narratives around geoengineering.&nbsp; Expected key outcomes at COP30 were also discussed, including the Tropical Forest Forever Fund (TFFF), agreed indicators under the global goal on adaptation and a “Belém action mechanism” within the just-transition work programme.&nbsp; Climate finance continued to be a key feature across the numerous topics raised, in particular in the wake of the Baku to Belém roadmap – published just five days before the start of COP30.&nbsp; The webinar featured six Carbon Brief journalists – including three on the ground in Belém – covering all elements of the summit: Dr Simon Evans – deputy editor and senior policy editor Daisy Dunne – associate editor Josh Gabbatiss – policy correspondent Anika Patel – China analyst Aruna Chandrasekhar – land, food systems and nature journalist Molly Lempriere – policy section editor A recording of the webinar (below) is now available to watch on YouTube. The post Webinar: Carbon Brief’s first ‘ask us anything’ at COP30 appeared first on Carbon Brief.
