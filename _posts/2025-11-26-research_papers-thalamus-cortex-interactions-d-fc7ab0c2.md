Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 47, November 2025. SignificanceUnderstanding how the thalamus shapes the human cerebral cortex is fundamental to unraveling the principles of brain development and the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs) derived ...
