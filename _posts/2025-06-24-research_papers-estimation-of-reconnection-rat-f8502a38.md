Abstract We propose an approach to estimating the reconnection rate by utilizing soft X‐rays emitted during the solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) process at the Earth's magnetopause. Employing a high‐resolution global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation model of the magnetosphere, we investigated the SWCX emission around the magnetopause during a coronal mass ejection event. Under these intense solar wind conditions, we observed that the current sheet in the dayside reconnection region is remarkably luminous, with the emission structure aligning closely with the reconnected magnetic field topology in the meridional plane. By calculating the opening angle of this bright region, we determined the reconnection rate to be 0.13. We compared this global rate with the one derived from the local reconnection electric field obtained in the MHD simulation. We suggest that coordinated remote and in situ observations of the reconnection region present an opportunity to bridge the gap between local and global reconnection rates.
