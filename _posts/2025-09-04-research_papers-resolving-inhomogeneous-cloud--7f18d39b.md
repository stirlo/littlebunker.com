Abstract Understanding cloud‐top microphysics is essential for improving weather forecasting and convection monitoring. In this study, we propose a simplified cloud scattering light model to analyze the influence of inhomogeneities in the cloud microphysical properties on the observations of blue corona discharges (BLUEs) from Atmosphere‐Space Interactions Monitor. The results show that the depth inferred from the inhomogeneous model is consistently lower than that from the homogeneous model, with the largest difference reaching 2 km. We then present a new approach to inferring inhomogeneous cloud microphysical profiles based on the optical signals from BLUEs using radio‐inferred source depths. These profiles match well with Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation lidar measurements and show a transition nearby tropopause with different exponential change rates above and below it. Our study highlights the potential of combining optical and radio observations of BLUEs to rapidly assess cloud microphysics and monitor convective activity.
