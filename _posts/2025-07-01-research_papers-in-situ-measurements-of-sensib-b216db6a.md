Abstract Sensible heat fluxes play a major role in the formation and dynamics of Tropical Cyclones (TC), however in situ measurements of these fluxes have been impeded by the challenging and extreme conditions associated with these events. We used two sonic anemometers elevated at fixed height above the mean ocean surface to measure sensible heat fluxes using the eddy covariance method during the near‚Äêpassage of TC Olwyn and Quang. We do so after empirically deriving a conversion factor between virtual temperature, as measured by the anemometer, and the absolute temperature. We find that the magnitudes of these fluxes during the passage of the TC largely agree with COARE 3.6, but have opposite sign. This sign change may be the result of complex interaction processes between the ocean and atmosphere.
