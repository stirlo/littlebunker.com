Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, pose a significant threat to millions of people worldwide each year. Considering the relationships between the emergence of these diseases and anthropogenic climate change, it has become imperative for health authorities to maintain detailed surveillance of key environmental variables that can trigger epidemic episodes. While disease transmission is generally conditioned by multiple socio-economic factors, environmental suitability for vectors and viruses to proliferate is a necessary—although not sufficient—condition that needs to be closely monitored. To this end, the Aedes-borne dIsease monitoring of environmental suitability (AIMES) system improves on the disease transmissibility framework of AeDES, the most up-to-date system of this kind in the current literature. AIMES broadens both the temporal and spatial scope of its predecessor, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of the environmental suitability index. It provides continuously updated monthly historical values derived from multiple observational references, enabling a robust quantification of the observational uncertainty.
