Abstract This study examines how anomalously high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Arabian Sea and surrounding gulfs contributed to the record‐breaking rainfall (250 mm day−1 ${\\text{day}}^{-1}$) over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 16 April 2024, with the greatest impacts in Dubai, Al‐Ain, and Abu Dhabi. Numerical modeling and satellite observations were used to examine the atmospheric and oceanic conditions leading to this extreme event. Sensitivity experiments show that warm SST anomalies enhanced moisture supply and intensified convection, producing larger and more intense convective storms. The warmer SSTs increased both moisture availability and storm intensity. The sensitivity model runs show higher precipitable water across much of the domain in the week preceding 16 April. Results indicate that, while atmospheric dynamics played a key role, SST‐driven moisture was the primary driver of the 16 April heavy precipitation. These findings underscore the role of ocean‐atmosphere interactions in driving extreme weather in arid regions.
