Abstract Naturally occurring whistler‐mode waves in near‐Earth space play a crucial role in accelerating electrons to relativistic energies and scattering them in pitch angle, driving their precipitation into Earth's atmosphere. Here, we report on the results of a controlled laboratory experiment focusing on the excitation of whistler waves via temperature anisotropy instabilities–the same mechanism responsible for their generation in space. In our experiments, anisotropic energetic electrons, produced by perpendicularly propagating microwaves at the equator of a magnetic mirror, provide the free energy for whistler excitation. The observed whistler waves exhibit a distinct periodic excitation pattern, analogous to naturally occurring whistler emissions in space. Particle‐in‐cell simulations reveal that this periodicity arises from a self‐regulating process: whistler‐induced pitch‐angle scattering rapidly relaxes the electron anisotropy, which subsequently rebuilds due to continuous energy injection and further excites wave. Our results have direct implications for understanding the process and characteristics of whistler emissions in near‐Earth space.
