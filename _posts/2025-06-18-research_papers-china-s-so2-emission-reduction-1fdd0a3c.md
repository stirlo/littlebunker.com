Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 24, June 2025. SignificanceSulfate (SO42−) aerosols contribute to both climate change and air pollution. Despite substantial SO2emission reductions in China, the corresponding decrease in SO42−concentrations across East Asia has been less effective. Using triple ...
