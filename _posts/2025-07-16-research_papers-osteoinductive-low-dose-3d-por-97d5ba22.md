Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceThis research addresses a significant challenge in bone regenerative engineering by incorporating a minimal concentration of osteoinductive calcium phosphate graphene (CaPG) into a 3D porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) matrix to ...
