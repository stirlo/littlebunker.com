Nature Climate Change, Published online: 04 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02460-5This study explores pathways of emissions and mitigation compatible with four climate boundaries—planetary boundaries for the climate system. The results highlight the importance of peak emission timing, limitation of carbon budgets as a sole indicator and trade-offs between mitigation options.
