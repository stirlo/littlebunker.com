Abstract Atmospheric rivers (ARs) have long been recognized as a major precipitation deliverer in western North America. Meanwhile, ARs in inland and east coast areas and their impacts beyond precipitation are starting to get recognized. The GOES‐16 satellite, with its longitudinal location, provides an opportunity for improved observational understanding of ARs across the Americas. Using lightning observations from the satellite and an AR database based on the MERRA‐2 reanalysis, this study investigates the influence of ARs on lightning and its seasonal and geographical variations. Compared to the annual AR frequency of 30% during lightning days in a number of locations. Compared to all wet days, mean flash density during AR wet days can be higher by a factor of >∼2 depending on the locations. Although long‐lived and traveling ARs have the strongest moisture transport, short‐lived ARs are associated with the highest flash density.
