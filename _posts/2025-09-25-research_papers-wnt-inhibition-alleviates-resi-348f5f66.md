Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 38, September 2025. SignificanceGBM patients face extremely limited treatment options and poor responses to current immunotherapies. Our findings reveal that targeting the Wnt7b/Î²-catenin pathway can sensitize stem-cell rich GBM to immune checkpoint blockade, offering a ...
