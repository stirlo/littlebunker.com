The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is calling for nominations of participants to two three-day co-located workshops to be held in the first quarter of 2026: a Workshop on Engaging Diverse Knowledge Systems and&nbsp; a Workshop on Methods of Assessment.&nbsp; This follows the Panelâ€™s agreement of a proposal made by the IPCC Chair with the support of a drafting group, during its 62nd Session held in Hangzhou, China ( IPCC-LXII/Doc. 7, Rev.1 ). The scope of the Workshop on Engaging Diverse Knowledge Systems is to consider what systems of knowledge the IPCC can engage with and assess within the framework of existing principles and procedures. The scope of the Workshop on Methods of Assessment is to consider the means by which such knowledge systems can be assessed.&nbsp; Both workshops will also consider the extent to which such means of synthesis and assessment may be conducted by the IPCC itself or by the knowledge holders and research communities who generate the literature on which the IPCC relies. Nominations for the workshops are welcome from knowledge holders, practitioners, and scientists with the relevant expertise. For the Workshop on Engaging Diverse Knowledge Systems, this would be expertise on the application and interpretation of diverse forms of knowledge, including:&nbsp; Indigenous Knowledge systems, especially from those who are members of Indigenous Peoples communities;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local knowledge (the understandings and skills developed by individuals and populations, specific to the places where they live); Practitioner knowledge (e.g. policymakers, NGO staff and community leaders who have experience of formulating strategies, implementing and/or evaluating policies and other climate actions); Scientific knowledge (including social sciences and the humanities). For the Workshop on Methods of Assessment, expertise would include: artificial intelligence to support assessment processes (including large language models, machine-learning tools and data for literature review); systematic review of scientific and grey literature, and other forms of knowledge; ex-post evaluation of climate action or other actions/policies/interventions relevant for climate change. Nominations are particularly encouraged from Indigenous Peoples representatives, those whose expertise bridges the two workshops, and those with relevant experience from other global environmental assessments.&nbsp; Those interested in being nominated as participants should contact their relevant IPCC Focal Point. A list of focal points for IPCC member governments and observer organizations is available here. Nominations are submitted through a dedicated online nomination tool by focal points in governments and accredited observer organizations, as well as IPCC Bureau members. Governments, observer organizations, and IPCC Bureau members have to submit their nominations by Wednesday 16 July 2025 (midnight CEST). More information on the nomination process is here. For more information, contact: IPCC Press Office, Email: ipcc-media@wmo.int; Andrej Mahecic, +41 22 730 8516; Werani Zabula, +41 22 730 8120.
