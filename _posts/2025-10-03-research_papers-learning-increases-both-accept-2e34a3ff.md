Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are increasingly recognized as necessary complements to decarbonization efforts; however, public acceptance remains a critical implementation challenge. This study investigates the impact of educational exposure on perceptions of CDR methods among individuals with a pre-existing interest in climate solutions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-surveys of participants (n = 366 pre-survey, n = 83 post-survey, n = 29 matched pairs) enrolled in a six-week online CDR curriculum. Baseline comparisons with previous studies confirmed that participants were more knowledgeable about CDR and held more positive environmental attitudes than nationally representative population samples. Following the educational intervention, participants demonstrated significant increases in self-reported CDR knowledge and more favourable risk-benefit assessments across all CDR technologies, with the largest gains for enhanced weathering and biochar. Qualitative analysis revealed that, rather than simple endorsement, education fostered more nuanced evaluation capabilities, with participants developing greater appreciation for both benefits and method-specific limitations. Notably, participants shifted away from technology-specific preferences and towards more portfolio-based thinking, recognizing the complementary roles of different CDR approaches. These findings suggest that informed engagement with CDR technologies produces sophisticated rather than uncritical assessment frameworks, with implications for how CDR communication and engagement strategies might be designed to support constructive public dialogue about these emerging technologies.
