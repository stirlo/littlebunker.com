Abstract Despite their importance to a variety of plasma processes in Jupiter's magnetosphere, properties of the thermal and suprathermal electrons have been sparsely reported in past literature. To address this gap, we used data from Juno's Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment Electron sensors to survey electron properties in Jupiter's magnetodisc between M‐shells of M = 9–40 and magnetic latitudes less than 20° within years 2016–2023. We fit the electron measurements with a sum of two anisotropic kappa distributions and provide estimates of the electron density, temperature, anisotropy, and thermodynamic kappa for the cold and hot populations, separately. We find that the electron temperature increases non‐adiabatically with M‐shell and the cold electron temperature anisotropy is most extreme near M = 15. We also provide estimates of the ambient electron properties near the Galilean moons, which should be treated with caution considering the many caveats of the fitting process, which is often associated with large uncertainties.
