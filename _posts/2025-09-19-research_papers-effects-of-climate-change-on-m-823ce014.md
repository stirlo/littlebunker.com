Anthropogenic climate change (CC) has triggered a cascade of impacts on marine ecosystems, often referred to as the ‘deadly trio’: warming, acidification, and deoxygenation. While these stressors will globally lead to the compression of marine habitats, their regional effects vary significantly and remain understudied. This is particularly true for the southeastern Pacific (SEP), which supports rich pelagic and benthic ecosystems closely linked to a complex seafloor featuring archipelagos and extensive seamount chains. Using model simulations from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, this study examines future regional-scale environmental changes in the SEP. Our analysis builds on the observation that the South Pacific Ocean Gyre is among the regions experiencing the least warming globally and that the epipelagic zone within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) may oxygenate in the future. These conditions may promote habitat expansion, which we assess using the climate velocities for temperature, oxygen, and pH. Estimates of climate velocities from the ensemble model mean under a pessimistic near future (2015-2050) yield values ranging from –730 to 449 km/year, exhibiting greater absolute climate velocities for oxygen than pH. Over the longer-term horizon (2015–2100), the area of zones where absolute climate velocity exceeded the 75th percentile increased by 65%, 72%, and 215% for temperature, oxygen, and pH, respectively. The strongest velocities (absolute value) occur in the equatorial sector and in the Humboldt system. While all regions mostly show a climate-driven habitat loss due to surface-to-200 m pH decline, two broad areas benefit from conservation below the surface: a region in the tropics extending from 10°S–100°W to the east of Rapa Nui and the coastal region of Peru and Chile, extending up to the Desventuradas and Juan Fernández archipelagos. While the former is due to the slow warming rates (<2.9 km yr−1), the latter results from both slow deoxygenation and oxygenation climate velocities (between −2.9 and 2.9 km yr−1) along the coast of those countries, a zone that overlaps with the lowest changes in pH in the SEP, giving them a unique conservation value. We demonstrate that epipelagic ecosystems within the OMZ may be less impacted by CC than those outside of it. These findings highlight key areas for conservation under future ocean warming, deoxygenation and pH changes.
