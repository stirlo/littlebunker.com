WASHINGTON (January 7, 2026) — Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture released new dietary guidelines for Americans for the next five years.Following is a statement from Raychel Santo, Senior Food and Climate Research Associate in WRI's Food, Land &amp; Water Program:“The new U.S. dietary guidelines prioritize protein, part of a wider societal trend. While there are many ways to meet our protein needs, not all protein sources have the same impact on people or the planet. Beef and lamb, in particular, have some of the highest environmental costs of any protein-rich food — with significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water pollution per ounce of protein than most alternatives.\\"The good news is that it’s entirely possible to eat a healthy, protein-adequate diet high in plant-based foods. Beans, lentils, soy, nuts, and seeds are great sources of protein and often other important nutrients such as fiber and iron while being far better for the planet than foods like beef and lamb.\\"Climate-conscious consumers and food businesses have more and more options for which protein-rich foods to prioritize. With so many good plant-based options available today, choosing less resource-intensive proteins is an easy and practical step people can take for both themselves and the climate.”
