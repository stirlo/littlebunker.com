Nature Climate Change, Published online: 09 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02537-1Channelized subsurface melting is an important process in the dynamics of ice shelves. Here the authors present observational data from Antarctic ice shelves and show that their basal melt is up to 50% higher than previously assumed.
