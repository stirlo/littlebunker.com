During Earth's ancient Snowball periods, when the entire planet was wrapped in ice, life may have endured in tiny meltwater ponds on the surface of equatorial glaciers. MIT researchers discovered that these watery refuges could have supported complex eukaryotic life, serving as sanctuaries for survival amid extreme conditions. Their investigation into Antarctic melt ponds revealed not only evidence of eukaryotes but a striking diversity shaped by factors like salinity. These findings reshape our understanding of how life weathered one of the harshest climate events in Earth s history and ultimately set the stage for the evolution of complex life forms.
