Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 4, January 2026. SignificanceFor many years, oxidants were thought only to have deleterious effects on cells. We now know that the intracellular oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a physiological role in endothelial cell signaling involving the NADPH oxidase isoforms ...
