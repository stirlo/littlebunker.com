Abstract It is well known that Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) temperatures at both high and mid‐low latitudes respond significantly to geomagnetic storms. However, during major geomagnetic storms, the temperature response in the MLT equator is relatively weak and has received little attention. In 2024, two superstorms, one on Mother's Day and another in October, provided a rare opportunity to investigate the effects of superstorms on equatorial MLT temperatures. During superstorms, MLT equatorial temperature increase observed by TIMED/SABER can surpass 40 K and vary with local time, showing stronger responses during nighttime and the dawn sector compared to midafternoon and dusk. The equatorial MLT temperature increases surpassed those in low and even mid‐latitude regions. ΣO/N2 increase derived from TIMED/GUVI indicates that downward vertical flows result in the equatorial temperature anomaly increase. This study enhances our understanding of MLT dynamics under extreme space weather conditions, providing valuable insights for improved predictive models.
