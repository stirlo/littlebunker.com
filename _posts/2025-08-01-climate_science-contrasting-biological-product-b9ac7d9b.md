Nature Climate Change, Published online: 01 August 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02375-1The authors jointly assess the changes in land and ocean net primary production from 2003 to 2021. They show contrasting trends, with overall planetary increases (0.11 ± 0.13 PgC yr−1) driven by terrestrial enhancement and offset by oceanic decline.
