Brussels (11 June 2025) — Today, World Resources Institute (WRI), We Mean Business Coalition, and Strategic Perspectives convened high-level policymakers, business leaders and experts to push for a robust 2040 emissions target and a credible 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;With key climate decisions, including the EU Environmental Council meeting (June 17) and the European Commission’s Climate Law amendment (July 2) approaching, experts underlined the mounting costs of inaction. Over the past decade, climate-related damages in the EU exceeded €145 billion, while fossil fuel imports reached €376 billion in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, renewable energy now supplies a record 48% of EU electricity, underscoring the potential for a cleaner, more resilient economy.At the event, We Mean Business Coalition, in collaboration with Corporate Leaders Group Europe (CLG Europe), also launched a policy note outlining how policymakers and businesses can collaborate on a robust, investible EU NDC that helps enhance energy security, economic strength and industrial competitiveness.&nbsp;Following are statements from participating leaders:María Mendiluce, CEO, We Mean Business Coalition: “The EU’s next NDC must send a clear signal that the EU is serious about competing and leading in the global low-carbon economy. Business is ready to invest, but needs policy clarity and predictability. A robust NDC aligned with the EU’s existing commitments — together with clear plans and policies for implementation — will boost business confidence, drive innovation, and deliver a more resilient and competitive economy.”Karen Pflug, Chief Sustainability Officer, Ingka Group: “The swift adoption of the EU’s NDC and an ambitious 2040 climate target is essential in providing assurance to progressive companies investing in the green transition at a time of great uncertainty. The EU must remain a global leader in this space, focusing on and communicating about the opportunities for the jobs, innovation and economic growth that climate ambition presents.”Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice-President, WRI: “With key milestones ahead, like the COP30 climate summit in November, the EU has a critical strategic choice to make. Major economies — particularly China — are ramping up investment in clean energy and industry. An ambitious NDC puts the EU on course to compete for the market of the future and secure its energy independence.”&nbsp;Cedric de Meeûs, VP Group Public Affairs and Social Impact, Holcim: “As industry we need regulatory certainty which is an integral part of the business case for large-scale industrial transformation. It’s the foundation for the long-term investments we are making and planning for the future. We can simplify regulation, but we should not dilute, nor delay.Anne-Sophie Cerisola, Distinguished Fellow, Strategic Perspectives: “With the upcoming NDC, the EU must demonstrate it will remain the climate leader it has been for the past decade. Internationally, the EU should work with other countries and companies, for example, in greening supply chains. It's vital to support developing countries with finance and technical assistance, especially amid ODA cuts and high capital costs — and to back Brazil's efforts to build a broad climate coalition, from China to small island states.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
