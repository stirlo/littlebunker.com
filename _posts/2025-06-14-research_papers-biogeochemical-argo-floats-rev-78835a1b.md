Abstract The Lofoten Basin Eddy (LBE) is a persistent topographically constrained anticyclonic eddy in the Norwegian Sea. Considering its local, dynamically distinct state, we test the hypothesis that the LBE has unique biogeochemical signatures. Using satellite observations and a 12‐year Biogeochemical‐Argo float record, we constructed a climatological view of the annual biogeochemical cycle within and surrounding the LBE. The biological carbon pump influenced by the LBE was less effective than surrounding waters, particularly during late spring. Particulate organic carbon export out of the productive zone was hindered during summer and likely associated with enhanced respiration and slower particle sinking speeds. Enhanced export into the twilight zone was also observed and consistent with shoaling of deep mixed layers in early spring, production of large particles in late summer, and subduction in late autumn; however, these mechanisms appear to be accompanied by enhanced remineralization within the LBE influence zone, highlighting the biogeochemical complexity of eddies.
