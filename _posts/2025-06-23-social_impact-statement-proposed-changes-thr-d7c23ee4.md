BRUSSELS (June 23, 2025) – Earlier this year, the European Commission announced measures to simplify the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which is set to be enforced from 30 December 2025. Since then, a number of EU member states and political groups in the European Parliament have been pushing to further weaken the regulation — most recently during the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in May 2025, and in parliamentary committee discussions this month.These attempts include proposals to create a “no-risk” country category, which could exempt certain countries from key due diligence obligations — potentially creating a loophole for deforestation-linked goods to enter the EU market with reduced oversight; and another to postpone implementation to allow more time for simplifying the EUDR.Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice-President and Regional Director for Europe of World Resources Institute:“Renewed attempts to weaken and delay the EUDR are deeply concerning and could jeopardize global efforts to combat record-breaking forest loss. The latest data shows that in 2024 alone, the world lost 6.7 million hectares of tropical primary rainforest, an area nearly the size of Ireland.The proposed “no-risk” country category would erode the foundations of the EUDR's due diligence system, which is central to the law’s credibility and impact. WRI's analysis from November 2024 shows it could open up major loopholes and make the regulation much less effective.While concerns about implementation challenges are understandable, it's important to acknowledge that many businesses have already taken steps to comply. Reopening the debate now — just six months before enforcement — could unintentionally penalize early movers and send the wrong signal about the EU's reliability as a market grounded in legal certainty and stability.Implementation must be made practical and inclusive — but rolling back on core safeguards risks undermining trust in both the EU legislative process and Europe's commitment to forest protection. The European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States should stay the course and deliver the EUDR as planned, in collaboration with producers, businesses and countries.”&nbsp;
