Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 33, August 2025. SignificanceThe MS2 virus packages its RNA genome into a protective protein capsid while excluding nearly all host-cell RNA. How MS2 achieves this remarkable selectivity remains unclear, despite decades of active research. Our study shows that packaging ...
