Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceTheSalmonellasurface protein PagC is a major driver of extracellular vesicle formation. Here, we show that this phenotype is transferrable toEscherichia coli, another diderm, Gram-negative bacterium. PagC increases vesicle production inE. ...
