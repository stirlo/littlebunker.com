Nature Climate Change, Published online: 13 February 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-026-02571-7Planning for climate action in food systems requires disaggregated spatial information on greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Now, a study on the major emission sources for global croplands yields such emissions estimates, identifies the locations of hotspots and assesses mitigation trade-offs with food productivity.
