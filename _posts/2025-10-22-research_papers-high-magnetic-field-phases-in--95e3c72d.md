Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 42, October 2025. SignificanceThe heavy fermionf-electron superconductor UTe2has attracted a great deal of interest because of its extraordinary superconducting and magnetic properties which have led to conjectures that this compound may exhibit spin-triplet ...
