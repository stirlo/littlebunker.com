Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceThe human brain has a high energy requirement and must be able to dynamically adjust its energy supply as needed. However, the dynamic nature of brain glucose use is not well understood. In this work, we identify the variability in...
