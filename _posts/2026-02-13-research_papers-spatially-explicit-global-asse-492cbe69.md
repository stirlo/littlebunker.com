Nature Climate Change, Published online: 13 February 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-026-02558-4Emissions from croplands are an important source of GHG emissions that can be shaped by management. This study presents maps of emissions globally for different crops, showing that drained peatlands, rice paddies and fertilizer were the main drivers, and highlights differences in emission intensity.
