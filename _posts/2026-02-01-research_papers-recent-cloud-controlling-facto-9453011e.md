Abstract Cloud feedback is a dominant source of uncertainty in climate model estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). Cloud controlling factor analysis can observationally constrain cloud feedback. For the first time, we use separate rather than unified frameworks to assess high‐ and low‐cloud feedbacks and constrain the net cloud feedback and subsequently, the ECS. We find a robustly positive cloud feedback (i.e., a negative feedback is <0.5 ${< } 0.5$% probable), indicating that clouds amplify global warming. We assess the individual and combined impacts of our cloud feedback constraints on ECS using three approaches. Two indicate an upward ECS shift with reduced uncertainty, preserving ECS–feedback correlations but using cloud feedback as a single line of evidence. The third, a Bayesian framework combining multiple lines of evidence, also suggests a higher ECS but with a smaller increase and broader confidence range.
