Abstract Winter temperature variations in Siberia significantly influence climate anomalies and seasonal predictions across East Asia. While Bering Sea ice (BS_SIC) has emerged as an increasingly important factor in mid‐latitude climate, its connection to Siberian winter extremes remains poorly understood. Using observations, reanalysis data sets and ECHAM5 simulations, this study examines the influence of December BS_SIC on January extreme cold days (ECDs) in Siberia and the associated mechanisms. Results show that the interannual variability of BS_SIC is significantly correlated (r = 0.49) with Siberian ECDs during 2000/01–2020/21, whereas no significant correlation is found during 1979/80–1997/98. The enhanced BS_SIC variability after 2000 strengthens eddy‐mean flow interaction, generating a Rossby wave that propagates from Alaska to Eurasia. Energy conversion at the North Atlantic jet exit enables this wave train to extract energy from the mean flow, leading to a northward shift of the East Asian polar front jet and a reduction in Siberian ECDs.
