Belém, Brazil (November 12, 2025) — The COP30 Presidency and High-Level Climate Champions released the COP30 Action Agenda, which unites commitments from civil society, businesses, investors, cities, states and countries into a coherent framework tied to the Paris Agreement goals.The Action Agenda features six key axes guided by the Global Stocktake findings, including energy, industry, and transports; forests, ocean and biodiversity; agriculture and food systems; resilient cities, infrastructure and water; human and social development; and enabling issues of finance, technology and capacity-building.Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute:“The Action Agenda fills a critical gap by uniting the hundreds of climate initiatives that have grown in recent years into a common framework tied to the Global Stocktake goals. It reinforces the fact that governments and a broad array of real-economy actors need to work together to orchestrate change. Critically, the Agenda brings much-needed transparency to these pledges by requiring initiatives to publicly report on progress, spurring climate coalitions to deliver measurable results.“The Agenda elevates action across key systems — from cities to forests to energy. It highlights the CHAMP initiative, which unites national and local governments to deliver on climate goals. We look forward to partnering with Brazil and Germany as the first CHAMP co-chairs. It also brings together major efforts to restore forests and land through AFR100, advances ocean action via the Blue NDC Challenge, and showcases leadership on transforming food systems through the Alliance of Champions for Food Systems Transformation. On energy, it spotlights coalitions driving a just transition away from coal, decarbonizing heavy industries such as cement and concrete and more.“Finally, rigorous and transparent carbon accounting remains fundamental to progress. The Action Agenda reaffirms that the partnership between the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the foundation of the global carbon-accounting system — and the trusted standard for organizations pursuing credible climate action.”
