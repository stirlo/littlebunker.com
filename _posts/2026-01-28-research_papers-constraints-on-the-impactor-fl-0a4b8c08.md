Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 4, January 2026. SignificanceLunar regolith is the longest continuously accessible record of impact debris, integrating bombardment products for nearly 4 billion years. Conventional reconstructions of impactor flux based on siderophile and highly siderophile elements are ...
