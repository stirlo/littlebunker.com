Abstract Snow dampens sounds, but anecdotal reports concisely describe audible propagating collapse events—firnquakes—in Antarctic and Arctic snowfields. We propose combining granular and continuum mechanics to form a testable theory for conditioning, triggering, and propagation of firnquakes consistent with scarce data. A central condition for collapse events is unconsolidated firn at depth. As firn grains compact, stresses are transmitted along force chains which carry the overburden and transition into a continuous medium by pressure sintering. This granular legacy creates solid‐like supports of denser layers that keep the material below unconsolidated. Dynamic amplification triggers local brittle failure of the supports, which induces a cascade of collapse propagation. Using bulk density from ice cores as proxy for stiffness, we find the flexural wave speed by collapsing supports matches the recorded firnquake velocities on the order of 100 m/s. Our theory is to be tested in firn sheets and other compacting granular materials.
