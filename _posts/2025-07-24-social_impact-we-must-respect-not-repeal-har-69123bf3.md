The EPA Must Be Allowed to Continue Setting Limits on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Contact: kayla@unbendablemedia.com Washington DC &#8211; In the coming days, the Trump administration is expected to move forward with a repeal of the Endangerment Finding, a 2009 foundational rule that enables the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other major polluters. The Endangerment Finding acknowledges what science and frontline communities have long known: that climate pollution poses a direct and growing threat to human life. Rather than enabling clean, green, and community-led solutions, this repeal proposal is part of the larger wave of anti-community and anti-science rollbacks that have defined the administration’s agenda and the larger goals of Project 2025. It must be unequivocally opposed. At stake is nothing short of our collective public health. Communities across the country–especially long overburdened by pollution–deserve protection, not deregulation for the benefit of polluters’ financial gain. The science is clear: reducing greenhouse gas emissions is critical to our survival and the planet; what we do now will directly impact us and future generations to come. This repeal would gut the EPA’s ability to implement critical protections under the Clean Air Act, igniting a public health emergency. With record-breaking heatweaves, flooding, and extreme storms growing in intensity, we should be strengthening protections–not dismantling the very tools that keep families and communities alive. Allowing polluting industries to dig, burn, and dump more toxic waste will only exacerbate health crises across the country–worsening chronic illnesses like asthma, cardiovascular disease, heatstroke, and respiratory distress in every zip code. At the very moment when the International Court of Justice has reaffirmed the obligation of nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions; this current administration’s efforts would do the opposite–intentionally escalating the climate crisis. For the sake of families, our health, and communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis, the EPA’s authority to regulate pollution should be upheld and expanded, not trampled upon by industry giants. ### &nbsp; The post We Must Respect–Not Repeal–Hard-fought Community Protections like the Endangerment Finding appeared first on Climate Justice Alliance.
