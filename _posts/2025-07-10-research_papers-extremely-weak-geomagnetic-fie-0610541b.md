Abstract Superchrons represent critical phases in geomagnetic field evolution, offering insights into Earth's distinct internal states. However, the lack of research on how the longest Phanerozoic superchron (Permo‐Carboniferous Reverse Superchron, PCRS, ∼318–263 Ma) terminated limits our understanding of the geodynamic processes and the interaction mechanisms between the Earth's interior and surface environment. Here, we present reliable paleointensity results from lava flows of the Emeishan large igneous province (LIP), emplaced immediately following the permo‐carboniferous reverse superchron termination. Our results reveal that geomagnetic field intensity was exceptionally low during this period, averaging approximately one‐sixth of the modern field intensity. We find that major mass extinctions and environmental deterioration events coincide with extremely low geomagnetic field states and eruptions of LIPs. The observed temporal alignment among the geomagnetic field, biological evolution, and geodynamic processes may reflect associations between Earth's interior and surface processes.
