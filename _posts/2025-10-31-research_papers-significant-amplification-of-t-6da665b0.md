Abstract Turbulence is fundamental to energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical plasmas. Bow shock interactions have long been hypothesized to significantly modify turbulence in planetary environments, yet the quantification of such effects and their parametric dependencies remain largely unaddressed. Using in situ long‐term high‐time resolution measurements from NASA's MAVEN mission, we report the first observational characterization of the evolution and parametric dependence of the turbulence energy cascade rate εC ${\\varepsilon }_{C}$ at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales. Key findings reveal an averaged three‐order‐of‐magnitude enhancement in εC ${\\varepsilon }_{C}$ when transitioning from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. Notably, downstream measurements of oblique and quasi‐perpendicular shocks exhibit higher energy dissipation rates than those of quasi‐parallel configurations. These results provide the first direct evidence linking shock obliquity to turbulence amplification, offering key insights into shock‐mediated turbulence in similar but inaccessible systems.
