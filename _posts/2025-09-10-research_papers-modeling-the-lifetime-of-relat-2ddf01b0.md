Abstract Microbursts, triggered primarily by chorus waves, are recognized as a key mechanism for relativistic electron loss in the Earth's outer radiation belt. Here, we combine a global distribution of chorus wave amplitudes, wave element occurrence rate, and trapped relativistic electron fluxes with a wave‐particle interaction model to estimate the associated electron precipitation. By quantifying both the total electron content and the loss rate, we derive the relativistic electron lifetimes across different L‐shells. Our results produce typical lifetimes of several tens of hours in the 5 ≤ L ≤ 6.5 region, consistent with previous observations. We confirm the fundamental role of chorus waves in driving global relativistic electron loss in the outer radiation belt and establish a direct connection between chorus waves and global relativistic electron loss.
