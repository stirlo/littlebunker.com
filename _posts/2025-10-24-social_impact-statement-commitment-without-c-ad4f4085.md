Brussels (October 24, 2025) – The European Council yesterday reaffirmed its support for the EU’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040. However, it stopped short of setting a clear and ambitious target for its upcoming Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which is due by COP30.&nbsp;In September, the European Commission put forward a “statement of intent” to cut emissions by 66.25 – 72.5% by 2035 from 1990 levels. &nbsp;Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, World Resources Institute: &nbsp;“Europe stands behind the 90% emission cut goal by 2040 ‒ a strong signal of continued intent. But without formalizing its 2035 climate plan (NDC), the pathway to climate neutrality remains unclear. &nbsp;\\"EU leaders have now put the ball in the court of environment ministers, who must deliver a science-based and credible NDC by early November, ahead of COP30 in Belém. A clear, high-ambition pathway is the most credible way to turn the EU's climate goals into real action: cleaner air, stronger energy security, resilient communities and lasting competitiveness.&nbsp;“We warn against the EU Council’s reliance on carbon credits to hit its 2040 goal. While credits, under strict guardrails, can help support decarbonization efforts abroad, they don't replace the structural changes needed at home. Europe must invest in transforming energy, industry, housing, and transport. &nbsp;&nbsp;“Every euro spent on credits is a euro not invested in delivering cleaner, economic growth, jobs and resilience for European citizens. In this context, the Council’s call to revise the agreed EU ETS 2, the EU's emissions trading scheme for transport and buildings starting in 2027, risks undermining business confidence and the credibility of EU climate policy. &nbsp;\\"The EU's repeated delays come at a cost. Missing the September 2025 NDC deadline means the EU ‒ one of the world's major economic blocs ‒ will be left out of the UNFCCC's NDC forthcoming Synthesis Report, losing an opportunity to spur greater ambition from other major emitters.&nbsp;EU environment ministers must grab the chance to reclaim Europe’s global climate leadership with the most ambitious NDC before COP30, showing European business clear investment pathways to a clean, competitive economy.” &nbsp;
