Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 4, January 2026. SignificanceOne intriguing difference between the two largest planets in the solar system is their polar vortex structures: Jupiter hosts multiple vortices at its poles, while Saturn exhibits a single polar vortex. By systematically surveying the ...
