The international discourse on loss and damages (L&amp;Ds) under the climate convention is ongoing. Significant attention has been given to a dedicated fund to assist vulnerable countries to recover from climate related L&amp;D. While much of the political discussion focuses on the amount of funding needed and who should pay, less attention is given to risk reduction initiatives eligible for the L&amp;D funding mechanisms. There is also an emerging need to link L&amp;D funding with adaptation (funds) which is not yet being given enough consideration. Against this background, the paper presents different dimensions of L&amp;D for example on severity and compensability, and provides a new perspective that goes beyond the current discourse of economic versus non-economic or direct versus indirect L&amp;D. A global analysis is complemented with a set of L&amp;D related case studies to explore both conventional economic dimensions of L&amp;D, and under-represented dimensions, such as population displacement and human mobility, territory and cultural heritage. These cases highlight how different types of L&amp;D are articulated in climate related initiatives. The cases point towards the need to better connect L&amp;D and adaptation strategies and funding to strengthen climate resilience. The paper informs the ongoing international debate on L&amp;D, highlighting the importance of understanding its different dimensions, the effectiveness of climate-related policies across countries and the need to rethink the concept of L&amp;D as compensation, since this falls short of supporting climate resilience. Recommendations emphasize national and local level monitoring, funding tools and international cooperation.
