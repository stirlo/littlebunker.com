Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 38, September 2025. SignificanceProtein-coding circular RNA (circRNA) is an exciting RNA cargo capable of inducing strong protein production with greater durability of expression than linear species such as messenger RNA (mRNA). There is a dearth of literature describing the ...
