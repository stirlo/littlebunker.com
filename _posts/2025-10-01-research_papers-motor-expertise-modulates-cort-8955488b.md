Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 39, September 2025. SignificanceMotor imagery (MI) is widely used in sports training and rehabilitation, yet how expertise and task complexity jointly influence its neural basis remains unclear. Using fNIRS, this study shows that expert soccer players display lower cortical ...
