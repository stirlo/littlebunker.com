Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 40, October 2025. SignificanceOur study presents a flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl2) as an efficient method for rare earth elements (REE) separation and recovery from electronic waste. FJH-Cl2enables high-purity (&gt;90%) and high-yield (&gt;90%) ...
