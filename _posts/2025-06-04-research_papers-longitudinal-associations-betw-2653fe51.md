Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 22, June 2025. SignificanceWhile the cortex undergoes rapid nonlinear change in the first years of life, it remains unclear how these changes, which occur prior to age five, are associated with later neurocognitive function. This is in part because little research to ...
