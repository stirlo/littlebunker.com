Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificancePhosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PIK3CA)-related disorders are rare genetic conditions caused by somatic gain-of-function mutations in the PIK3CA gene, affecting cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. These mutations often ...
