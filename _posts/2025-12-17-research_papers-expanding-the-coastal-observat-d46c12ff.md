Abstract This study investigates the ability of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite to capture storm‐surge‐driven high sea levels in coastal regions. For the first time, the evolving process of storm surges has been observed in 2D through SWOT satellite data, providing a unique spatial perspective on these local extreme events. To validate satellite‐derived sea level measurements, we compared SWOT observations with SCHISM hydrodynamical model and tide gauge records from the Baltic, North Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, spanning micro‐to macro‐tidal environments. ERA5 wind and pressure fields were used to verify atmospheric conditions driving surge events. Excellent agreement between SWOT, in situ, and SCHISM model data was observed. These findings underscore SWOT's transformative potential for advancing coastal hazard monitoring, filling observational gaps, tracking cyclone‐driven sea level effects and enhance our understanding of how these events influence coastal dynamics.
