Abstract The impact of air pollution control programs on the vertical structure of precipitation remains poorly understood. Using multiple data sources, we observed a yearly decrease in aerosol optical depth (AOD) in southern China from 2014 to 2019, probably due to these programs. In contrast, the precipitation top height related to rain onset (PTH0), increased annually after accounting for thermodynamic variations. Further analyses revealed that, within the mixed/lower atmospheric layers, the growth of precipitating particles (SlopeA/SlopeB) was significantly faster/slower in 2014 compared to subsequent years. The correlation coefficients (R) between AOD and SlopeA and PTH0 were 0.99 and −0.94, respectively. As this study is based on multi‐source observations, further research incorporating model simulations is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the impact of emission reductions on the vertical structure of precipitation.
