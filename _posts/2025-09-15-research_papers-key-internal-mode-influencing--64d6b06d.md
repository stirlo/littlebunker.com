Abstract Understanding the key internal mode that induces surface wind speed (SWS) change is vital for comprehending the SWS−related physical processes. This study demonstrates that the decadal transition in winter SWS across China is primarily attributed to the internal mode associated with the Warm Arctic−Cold Eurasia (WACE) pattern. Removing the WACE−related SWS change causes the internal component of the SWS trend to reduce by approximately 25.0%. Enhancing the simulation of the WACE pattern improves the decadal transition prediction of SWS. In the near future, the contribution of the WACE pattern to the SWS trend reaches about 21.4%, and the forcing scenario has a negligible influence on the results. The WACE−related uncertainty in the global climate model could be an important source of reducing the WACE's contribution. This study highlights the need to consider how the WACE pattern affects the decadal SWS transition and to improve its predictive skill.
