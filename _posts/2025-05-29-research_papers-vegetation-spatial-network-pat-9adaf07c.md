The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is recognized as an essential ecological safeguard in China, significantly contributing to ecological stability and environmental protection. However, rapid socioeconomic development poses significant threats to the ecological security of the region. To address this issue, this study used normalized difference vegetation index data to identify ecological source areas. Using optimal parameters-based geographical detector model processed a multi-source data set to develop an ecological spatial network. Methods for topological and pattern analysis were utilized to examine the network. Additionally, various ecosystem services (ESs) within the ecological source areas and their interrelationships were calculated to analyze their associations with network characteristics, climate, and human factors under different network patterns. Finally, based on the importance of the structure and function of regional vegetation, a series of strategies has been proposed to optimize and protect the stability of its spatial distribution. The research findings show that: (1) areas with high ES indicator values are mainly found in the upper reaches of the YRB and the adjacent regions of the Taihang Mountains (2) the ecological spatial network of the YRB is denser in the mid-upper reaches and sparser in the lower reaches. (3) There is a significant synergy between water supply and water conservation within the ecological source areas, while landscape aesthetics and carbon storage, as well as water supply and carbon storage, exhibit significant trade-off effects. (4) Five network patterns and six ES bundles were identified. The correlation between ESs, network topological metrics, and climate-human factors varies across different patterns, with more structurally complete network patterns generally providing better ESs.
