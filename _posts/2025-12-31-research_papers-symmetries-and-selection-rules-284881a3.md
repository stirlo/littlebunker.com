Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 52, December 2025. SignificanceWe derive here a group theoretical description of selection rules imposed by symmetries of electromagnetic fields in photoelectron chiral dichroism (PECD). Our theory explains all known PECD selection rules, including the common forward/...
