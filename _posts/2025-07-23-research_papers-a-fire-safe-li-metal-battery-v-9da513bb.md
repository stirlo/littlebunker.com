Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 29, July 2025. SignificanceFlammable gases generated during thermal runaway critically impact the safety of high-energy-density Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating flame-retardant interfaces (FRIs) into the cathode enables a smart response to ...
