Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 45, November 2025. SignificanceRecent evidence suggests that patients responding favorably to immunotherapies typically exhibit a distinguished presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in their tumors. However, the origins and functions of TLSs in antitumor immunity ...
