Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 52, December 2025. SignificanceHere, we identify a resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) signature of recovery after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI): the preservation of functional anticorrelations. This signature accurately predicted functional outcomes ...
