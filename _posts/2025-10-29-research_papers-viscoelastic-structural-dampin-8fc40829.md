Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 43, October 2025. SignificanceConventional acoustic metamaterials rely on air resonance and geometrically complex, high-stiffness structures to achieve low-frequency absorption, typically leading to negligible structural deformation. These approaches are inherently ...
