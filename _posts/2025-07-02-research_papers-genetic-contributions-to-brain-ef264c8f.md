Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 26, July 2025. SignificanceBrain criticality, a state of optimal neural balance between excitation and inhibition, is crucial for efficient cognitive function. Despite its significance, the genetic basis of brain criticality remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate ...
