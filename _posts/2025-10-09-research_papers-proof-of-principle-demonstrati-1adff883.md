Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 40, October 2025. SignificanceEpithermal neutron resonance spectroscopy has been limited by bulky spallation and accelerator-based sources, hindering on-site nuclear material analysis. This study employs a compact laser–driven electron accelerator to generate photonuclear ...
