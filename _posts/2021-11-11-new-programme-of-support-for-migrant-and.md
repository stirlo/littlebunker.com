				The programme will work with three organisations to help them develop projects focused on the connections between climate change, migration and displacement.
Background
As the planet warms, the effects of climate change will reshape patterns of migration and displacement across the world. Migration will potentially become a key coping strategy for millions, and existing migrants and refugees will be exposed to new hazards.
This programme is designed to help refugee and migrant rights organisations explore the ways in which climate change will impact their work and the communities they work with.
Who is it for?
The programme of support is for organisations working on migrant and refugee rights—and especially for migrant and refugee-led organisations. The programme of support is primarily for small- to medium-sized organisations. It is open to organisations with no previous experience of climate change work, as well as groups who have already started working on the issue.

				Programme of support
The programme will work closely with the selected organisations to help them with any of the following: 

explore what climate change will mean for their work and investigate the ways that climate change could impact the communities they work with
get to grips with the connections between climate change, migration and displacement
build knowledge and capacity within their organisations to create projects focused on the connections between climate change and migration
communicate with the members, supporters and the public about climate change and its importance to their work
Develop organisational strategies for future work on the connections between climate change and migration

This will take place through a year-long programme of bespoke advice, support and training. The specific goals and the programme will be set by the organisations themselves. 
Organisations will also have a chance to connect with each other, and with other organisations that are working on the issue.

				FAQ:
Does my organisation need to be a charity?
No, but you do need to have some kind of registered non-profit status.
Does my organisation need to be working on climate change already?
No, in fact we are keen for organisations with little or no experience of working directly on climate change to apply.
Does it cost anything to take part?
No, the entire programme is free.
Who is behind the programme?
The project is organised by the Climate and Migration Coalition, a project managed by the charity Climate Outreach. The project is funded by the JA Clarke Trust as well as by other donations.
