Abstract The eastern margin of the Sea of Japan is a zone of great seismic and tsunami hazard due to multiple offshore and nearshore reverse faults as shown by the 2024 Mw ${M}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ 7.5 Noto Peninsula Earthquake. Here we compare coseismic deformation of the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake with 4,767 individual marine terraces attributed to 16 successive sea‐level stages over the last Myr. This reveals that the earthquake faults started slipping between 326 and 238 ka. The emerged landscape is still adjusting to it while nearshore underwater scarps mark the active faults. Applied to nearby Sado Island, these observations reveal the likely location of an active fault that drives its fast deformation. Active faults defining the edge of uplifting land are likely found in the near shore domain, drowned by the current sea‐level high stand.
