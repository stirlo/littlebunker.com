Abstract Landslide movements typically show a series of progressively shorter quiescent phases, punctuated by sudden bursts during an acceleration crisis. We propose that such intermittent rupture phenomena can be described by a log‐periodic power law singularity model. Amounting mathematically to a generalization of the power law exponent from real to complex numbers, this model captures the partial break of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance that is inherent to the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture processes in heterogeneous geomaterials. By performing parametric and nonparametric tests on a large data set of 52 landslides, we present empirical evidence and theoretical arguments demonstrating the statistical significance of log‐periodic oscillations decorating power law finite‐time singularities during landslide crises. Log‐periodic landslide motions may stem from the interaction between frictional stress drop along geological structures and stress corrosion damage in rock bridges, as well as the interplay of inertia, damage, and healing.
