Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 47, November 2025. SignificanceT cells patrol short peptides displayed by MHC molecules to protect the body from infection and cancer. While there are currently computational approaches to predict which peptides will bind to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs), they ...
