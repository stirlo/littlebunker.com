Abstract This study statistically analyzes the electron precipitation patterns from 40 to 600 keV on dawnside and duskside and their correlations with geomagnetic activities and solar wind conditions based on Low‐Earth Orbit Fengyun‐3E (FY‐3E) satellite during July 2021 to May 2024. We found that for electrons less than 200 keV on dawnside between L shell of 6–10, the precipitation ratio (the ratio between precipitating flux and locally trapped flux) increases with increasing L and decreasing energy. This is caused by chorus wave pitch angle scattering precipitation. Conversely, the precipitation ratio increases with L and energy for electrons greater than 200 keV on both dawnside and duskside between L = 8–10. This may be due to electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and current sheet scattering. The occurrence rate when the precipitation ratio exceeds 0.5 is higher under conditions of elevated SME index, increased solar wind dynamic pressure, and southward interplanetary magnetic field.
