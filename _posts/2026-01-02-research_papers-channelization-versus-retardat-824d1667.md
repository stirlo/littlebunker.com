Abstract The migration of fluids, such as aqueous fluids and melts, is often channelized and crucial for trace element transport. However, trace elements typically migrate slower than the fluid due to partitioning between solid and fluid phases, known as retardation. The influence of channelization intensity on trace element retardation remains poorly quantified. Here, we use two‐dimensional numerical simulations to investigate trace element transport during compaction‐driven flow involving porosity waves and channelization caused by decompaction weakening. We employ a small‐amplitude porosity perturbation to study fluid segregation. A data collapse of systematic numerical results quantifies how the increase in channelization intensity cancels out the decrease in trace element transport caused by retardation, showing that channelized porosity waves enable segregated trace element mass transport. We illustrate changes of trace element distributions during fluid migration using multi‐element (spider) and ternary diagrams as well as trace element profiles across channels.
