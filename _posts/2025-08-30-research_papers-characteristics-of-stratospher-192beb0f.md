Abstract Gravity wave (GW) spectra can visualize the energy distribution between different scales. A large amount of data from the round‐trip intelligent sounding system in southern China is used to investigate the GW vertical spectra and the poorly studied stratospheric horizontal spectra of horizontal winds. The spectral structure evolution characteristics and their connection with convection are further explored. The results show that the vertical spectra in the stratosphere are more saturated than in the troposphere. The slope and amplitude distributions of the horizontal spectra vary across different frequency ranges. The slopes of the horizontal spectra show a significant correlation with convective activity, and during convection‐frequent periods, the horizontal spectral densities in the 5–2 min period decrease in the stratosphere. This study demonstrates that convective activity modulates energy transfer and distribution among multiscale disturbances in the stratosphere.
