Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 44, November 2025. SignificanceThe Tau protein forms amyloid fibrils in diseases like Alzheimer’s. Development of Tau fibrils correlate with disease progression. Until now, it has been very difficult to measure the size of these fibrils directly in solution. We developed ...
