Nature Climate Change, Published online: 20 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02450-7Meat products represent a large share of the carbon footprints of cities, which are dependent on the characteristics of supply regions. With spatially explicit data, researchers show how the so-called carbon hoofprint varies between cities due to the different carbon intensities of producing regions.
