Mads Christensen is Executive Director of Greenpeace International. As the military and diplomatic establishment gather for the annual Munich Security Conference, the air will be thick with talk of &#8220;strategic autonomy&#8221; and &#8220;energy security.&#8221; But there is little autonomy to talk of when sovereignty is for sale, and security is a hollow promise while regional stability depends on the weaponized resources of a rival power. We are witnessing the unmasking of a 19th-century worldview: Resource Colonialism. In Venezuela, the mask slipped quickly; the world watched as the United States Navy deployed off the coast, reviving gunboat diplomacy for the 21st century. This was confirmed by President Trump’s declaration that the U.S. would exercise &#8216;de facto control&#8217; over Venezuela’s oil industry.&nbsp; In Greenland, the ‘prize’ is territorial expansion, and minerals, coveted for economic gain and military security. The rush for Greenland’s minerals threatens to replicate every abuse of the oil age: building on the same colonial mindset, displacing Indigenous communities, poisoning local water, and overriding democracy. Rhetoric toward Greenland has shifted from pressure to hostility, then manifesting in the ‘framework of a future deal’ as announced by VP Vance. Feb 13, 2026 Politics After disappointing COP30, EU mulls &#8220;less naive&#8221; strategy for climate talks EU climate ministers are discussing how to show more &#8220;realism&#8221; and &#8220;pragmatism&#8221; in international climate negotiations Read more Feb 12, 2026 News COP31 chief slams climate backsliding, but rejects priority focus on fossil fuels After a first COP31 strategy meeting, Türkiye’s environment minister says he will &#8220;safeguard the development priorities&#8221; of developing countries Read more Emboldened by his bestseller ‘The Art of the Deal’, and the myth that he is the world’s ultimate businessman, Trump has replaced diplomacy with acquisition. His administration is treating sovereign territories and Indigenous homelands as if they were a real estate portfolio in Manhattan. Global liquidation sale The fact of the matter is that Trump’s transactional worldview, where everything has a price tag, is not leadership but a global liquidation sale. Backed by a cabal of fossil-fuel billionaires, this circle of autocrats is treating the 21st century like a distressed asset to be stripped bare, regardless of the costs to the rest of us. But growing up in Denmark and working in the Arctic for many years, there is one thing I know for certain: Greenland is not a deal to be made. It is not a place to be defined or controlled by anyone other than the people of Greenland.&nbsp; And this is not just an American problem. Look East, and you see the mirror image. As Greenpeace has documented, Russia has transformed into a total &#8220;fossil fuel war economy.&#8221; The Kremlin’s aggression is funded almost entirely by oil and gas exports, creating a feedback loop where extraction finances its war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as internal oppression. In response, European leaders have finally agreed to end Russian gas imports, but are blindly rushing headlong into a dependency on American liquefied fossil gas. Trading dependency on Putin for dependency on Trump, however, is not a security strategy: it&#8217;s a high-stakes game with very poor cards. This is a message European diplomats need to bear in mind in Munich this week as they gather to discuss urgent issues such as energy security: the more Europe depends on the US for energy, the greater the vulnerability to pressure by Trump. Climate action is “weapon” for security in unstable world, UN climate chief says Every euro spent on US oil and gas strengthens Trump&#8217;s authoritarian agenda at home and colonialist ambitions abroad, threatening Europe&#8217;s independence and security. The only way for Europe to achieve true energy security is to phase out fossil gas and accelerate the shift to a fully renewable energy system.&nbsp; The &#8216;Art of the Deal&#8217; mindset treats the world like a chessboard and uses the fact that the board is burning to advance its interests. To Trump, the melting ice in Greenland isn&#8217;t a global catastrophe but just a door opening to get to the minerals underneath. But when we treat the climate crisis as just another &#8216;variable&#8217; in a trade war, we lose the ability to cooperate.&nbsp; Path to peace and security lies in clean energy True security is not trading Russian gas for American fracking. It means phasing out fossil fuels and accelerating the shift to a fully renewable energy system that makes no dictator or president the master of Europe’s lights, whether they sit in Moscow, Mar-a-Lago or elsewhere. True security is a just transition away from fossil fuels, not a military scramble to burn them faster. Expanding oil extraction anywhere undermines global climate goals and increases climate risks everywhere. A fossil-free, peaceful future requires breaking the link between energy systems, militarisation and exploitation. Explainer: What is the petrodollar and why is it under pressure? The leaders gathering in Munich have a stark choice. They can acquiesce to the dogma that might make right and that sovereignty is for sale, or they can recognise that true security requires charting another path entirely with a rules-based global order at its heart. Rejecting resource colonialism needs to go hand in hand with boldly displaying different leadership: one that reclaims the moral compass. True leadership is built on solidarity, not threats. A healthy society isn’t measured by the profits of a few, but by the wellbeing of the many. Success isn’t about who wins; it’s about who thrives.&nbsp; We are defined by what we save, not what we take.
