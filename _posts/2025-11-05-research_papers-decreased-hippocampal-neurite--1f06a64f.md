Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 44, November 2025. SignificanceThe contribution of prenatal maternal inflammation (PNMI) to offspring brain microstructure in later life is well established in animal models but poorly understood in humans. Our study found long-lasting impacts of elevated PNMI during early ...
