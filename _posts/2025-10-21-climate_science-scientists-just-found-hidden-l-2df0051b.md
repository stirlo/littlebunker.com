Melting Arctic ice is revealing a hidden world of nitrogen-fixing bacteria beneath the surface. These microbes, not the usual cyanobacteria, enrich the ocean with nitrogen, fueling algae growth that supports the entire marine food chain. As ice cover declines, both algae production and CO2 absorption may increase, altering the regionâ€™s ecological balance. The discovery could force scientists to revise predictions about Arctic climate feedbacks.
