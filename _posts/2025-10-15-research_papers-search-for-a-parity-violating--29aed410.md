Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 41, October 2025. SignificanceParity-violating interactions mediated by exotic bosons could reveal physics beyond the Standard Model. We develop a hybrid spin-resonance (HSR) atomic sensor with 700-fold vibration suppression, achieving three orders-of-magnitude sensitivity ...
