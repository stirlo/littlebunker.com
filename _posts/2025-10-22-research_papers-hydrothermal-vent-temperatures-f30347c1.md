Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 42, October 2025. SignificanceWe document multidecadal temperature variations at a mid-ocean ridge (MOR) hydrothermal system and reveal that crustal and deep magmatic processes exert a clear control on seafloor venting temperatures. This finding has important implications, ...
