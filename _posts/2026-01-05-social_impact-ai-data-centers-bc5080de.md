Climate Justice Alliance created seven educational resources for alliance members outlining AI and data center environmental justice impacts, including increased energy consumption, ratepayer hikes, land and water acquisition and compromise, impacts on frontline communities, especially Black communities, and the implications for tech security. In October 2025, CJA took a delegation of 10 southern and southwest members to Memphis, Tennessee, to participate in a training hosted by Media Justice and Memphis Communities Against Pollution (MCAP) to educate and coordinate strategy to challenge data center development that has been shown to harm and/or extract from their communities. Following the training, CJA began working with members to create a new ad-hoc committee focused on supporting communities on the ground who are organizing to halt new data center projects, reject existing and new dirty energy projects related to data center development, ensure that environmental and health protections are upheld, and to demand regulation when development is inevitable. The post AI Data Centers appeared first on Climate Justice Alliance.
