Abstract This paper presents observations of upper atmospheric vortices following two geomagnetic storms: a Kp 9− storm on 10 October 2024 and a Kp 8+ storm occurring in April of 2023. These observations, using neutral composition and effective neutral temperatures from the NASA GOLD mission, reveal vortices similar to those initially reported by Evans, Correira, et al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL110506) for the historic geomagnetic storm of May 2024. Development of vortices following more typical geomagnetic storms demonstrate that such vortices are not as rare as was originally speculated. For all three storms, vortices appeared in GOLD data following similar elapsed times after storm onset and developed in the Southern Hemisphere at similar locations. The size of the vortices varied for the three storms, as did whether or not a vortex appeared in the Northern Hemisphere.
