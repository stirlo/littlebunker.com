Abstract We report the highest resolution altitude profile and isotopic composition for N2 at Venus, to date. These results were obtained through re‐analysis of data acquired by the Pioneer Venus Large Probe Neutral Mass Spectrometer (LNMS). The N2 is non‐uniformly mixed across the clouds and sub‐cloud atmosphere (∼59–15 km) yet uniformly mixed across the deep lower atmosphere (DLA, 15 km, (b) the atmosphere is unstable at <15 km, and (c) the cloud δ15N falls between the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere.
