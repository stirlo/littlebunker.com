Abstract Since its establishment in 2005, the APEC Climate Center (APCC) has pioneered advancements in seasonal climate prediction through its Multi‐Model Ensemble (MME) system, integrating the world's most diverse range of dynamical climate models. Over the past two decades, APCC has incorporated long‐range forecasts from more than 60 model versions, contributed by 21 institutions across 11 countries. This study presents the first diachronic assessment of the APCC MME system evolution, focusing on operational model transitions and associated substantial 34% improvement in global forecast skill. Despite these significant advances, challenges persist, particularly in predicting precipitation over land areas in the northern extratropics and in overcoming the spring predictability barriers. Our findings underscore the crucial role of model innovation, increased diversity, and international collaboration in advancing seasonal prediction. As the first study of its kind, this work provides key insights into the evolution of climate modeling, providing a foundation for future forecasting improvements.
