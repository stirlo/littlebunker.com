Abstract This study examines for the first time how submesoscale oceanic features (1–10 km) interact at a seasonal scale with the atmosphere over the Gulf Stream (GS) region using high‐resolution coupled simulations. Focusing on thermal and current feedbacks (TFB and CFB), we show that their combined influence peaks in summer, enhancing surface winds while partially offsetting in surface stress. This compensation reduces the stress response, especially along the GS. Seasonal coupling variations are driven by stronger TFB in summer and modulated by background wind conditions. Energy fluxes also exhibit strong seasonality: kinetic energy transfer to the atmosphere intensifies in winter, while, over the GS, potential energy gains can dominate in summer, partly influenced by CFB. These results highlight the importance of accounting for both feedbacks—and their seasonal variability—in studies of submesoscale air‐sea interactions. Future satellite missions and field campaigns will be essential to validate and extend these results.
