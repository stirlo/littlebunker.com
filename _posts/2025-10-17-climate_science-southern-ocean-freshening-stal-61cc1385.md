Nature Climate Change, Published online: 17 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02446-3The Southern Ocean carbon sink is predicted to decline under climate change. This study explores why this is yet to be seen in observations, finding that recent surface freshening increases stratification and traps the CO2-rich water in the subsurface layer, which prevents atmospheric outgassing.
