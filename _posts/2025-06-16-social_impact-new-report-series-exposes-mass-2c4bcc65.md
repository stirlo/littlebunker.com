‘The Just Returns Project’ Reports Call on Funders to Back Grassroots Climate Solutions Contact: kayla@unbendablemedia.com WASHINGTON, D.C. — As climate disruption escalates, bringing record-breaking wildfires, heat waves, and flooding to communities across the United States— new data released today by the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA), National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP), and the Tishman Environment and Design Center at The New School reveals a sobering truth: the vast majority of philanthropic climate dollars are not reaching the grassroots organizations leading real, effective solutions on the frontlines. The Just Returns Project report series finds that only 3% of climate funding from 50 influential U.S. foundations goes to grassroots climate justice groups—despite strong evidence that these organizations are delivering the most impactful, community-driven responses to the climate crisis. The Just Returns Project is based on a comprehensive analysis of public grantmaking and investment data from the 50 most influential U.S. climate funders in 2020, along with interviews with grassroots organizations across the country. The toolkit equips funders with a roadmap to shift away from extractive models and toward a more equitable, effective approach to climate action. Dr. Jennifer Santos Ramirez, Senior Researcher at the Tishman Environment and Design Center, said grassroots environmental and climate justice groups are often overlooked in both funding and policymaking—even though they are pioneering bold, intersectional solutions to the climate crisis. “Our latest research shows how these organizations are transforming systems and addressing climate change through strategies rooted in local knowledge, equity, and sustainability,” she said. “We urge funders to rethink what counts as a climate solution, and to expand how they define impact, scale, and success.” Key Findings from The Just Returns Project: Some philanthropies with climate missions have fossil fuel investments that even outweigh their climate giving. Only 3% of climate giving by 50 influential U.S. foundations supports grassroots groups. The top five researched funders control 40% of all climate philanthropy—most of which flows to large, legacy institutions. Billions continue to fund false solutions such as carbon capture, geoengineering, and fossil-fuel-backed private equity. Despite often operating with budgets under $5 million—and a third under $500,000——many of the grassroots environmental and climate justice organizations surveyed and interviewed for this series of reports address a wide range of interconnected issues, including: food systems, legacy pollution, economic equity, energy transitions, social justice, community development, and services. Many of these organizations run programs across five or more of these issue areas, reflecting an intersectional approach rooted in lived experience and local priorities. And while these organizations receive a fraction of the funding of larger institutions, they maintain robust strategic relationships at local, regional, and national levels—collaborating across coalitions, alliances, and sectors. The Just Returns series provides funders with actionable guidance for aligning their investments and grants with climate justice values. It includes three in-depth reports: Part One: Put Your Money Where Your Mission Is – How to Make Your Investments Climate-Justice Aligned Part Two: Put Your Money Where Your Mission Is – How to Make Your Grantmaking Practices Climate-Justice Aligned Part Three: Voicing the Power of Climate Justice &#8211; Insights on the Impact of Scale of Grassroots Initiatives KD Chavez, Executive Director of the Climate Justice Alliance, said the data confirms what frontline and Indigenous communities have experienced for decades: disproportionate disinvestment in their health, humanity, and solutions. “As civil society faces growing precarity and public funding declines, it’s time for philanthropy to move critical resources into the hands of those building resilient, community-rooted climate justice solutions,” Chavez said. “The opportunity is real—and urgent.” Senowa Mize-Fox of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy added that the research shows how philanthropy may be unintentionally undercutting its own goals when investments in oil and gas outpace environmental grantmaking. “Only 3% of climate and environmental funding is reaching frontline organizations doing transformative work,” Mize-Fox said. “There may be shiny, well-funded climate solutions out there, often backed by fossil fuel interests, but steady support for community-driven efforts is what actually delivers lasting results.” ### About the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP) The National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP) has served as philanthropy’s critical friend and independent watchdog since 1976. For nearly 50 years, NCRP’s storytelling, advocacy, and research efforts have fostered transparency and accountability within the sector, and helped funders fulfill their moral and practical duty to build, share, and wield power to serve the public.
