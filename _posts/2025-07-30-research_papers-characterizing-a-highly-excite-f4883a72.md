Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 30, July 2025. SignificanceUsing electroencephalography (EEG), we compared neural responses to critical in-game events with those from conventional laboratory tasks. Our results identified a unique brain response pattern, termed P300-CE, during gameplay, characterized ...
