Indian police have raided the homes and offices of high-profile Indian climate activists, on the orders of the government&#8217;s Enforcement Directorate, accusing them of jeopardising India&#8217;s energy security by campaigning against fossil fuels. The Delhi home and offices of Harjeet Singh and his partner Jyoti Awasthi, who are co-founders of Satat Sampada Private Limited (SSPL) and Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, were searched on Monday in an operation that led to Singh&#8217;s arrest, according to a press release by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). A statement issued on Wednesday by Satat Sampada, which promotes organic farming, sustainable development, climate action and environmental friendly solutions, said Singh had been granted bail on Tuesday by the District Court of Ghaziabad &#8220;on the merits of the case&#8221;. The Hindustan Times reported, based on conversations with anonymous officials, that the ED had also searched the home of Sanjay Vashisht, director of Climate Action Network South Asia.

Singh&#8217;s social media profiles state that he is a strategic advisor to the FFNPT Initiative. It is a non-governmental campaign that advocates for a &#8220;concrete, binding plan to end the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects and manage a global transition away from fossil fuels&#8221;. Eighteen countries &#8211; mainly small islands &#8211; have so far backed the idea, along with 145 cities and subnational governments including India&#8217;s Kolkata. India&#8217;s ED said on the FFNPT that while &#8220;presented as a climate initiative, its adoption could expose India to legal challenges in international forums like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and severely compromise the nation’s energy security and economic development&#8221;. The FFNPT Initiative declined to comment on the reports of Singh&#8217;s arrest. In the statement issued by Satat Sampada on their behalf, Singh and Aswathi, who serves as its CEO, highlighted media reports about the raid and arrest, saying: &#8220;We categorically state that the allegations being reported are baseless, biased, and misleading.&#8221; Warning of further crackdown The Hindustan Times cited an anonymous ED official saying: “We received intelligence around the COP30 [climate summit] that some climate activists were campaigning against fossil fuels at the behest of some foreign organizations…This is when we decided to look at [Singh&#8217;s] foreign funding”. Another officer added that “similar activists or organisations whose climate campaigns may be inimical to India’s energy security are under the scanner”. The ED said it suspected that Satat Sampada had received money from campaign groups like Climate Action Network and Stand.Earth, which in turn had received funds from &#8220;prior reference category&#8221; NGOs like Rockefeller Philanthrophy Advisors. Indian individuals and organisations are supposed to obtain permission from India&#8217;s Ministry of Home Affairs to receive funds from foreign donor agencies included in this &#8220;prior reference category&#8221;. The ED&#8217;s statement did not mention finding any evidence in the search that Satat Sampada breached this requirements. But it said that bottles of liquor were discovered at Singh&#8217;s home which were &#8220;beyond the permissible limits&#8221;. Singh was arrested on suspicion of breaching excise laws for the state of Uttar Pradesh. The ED&#8217;s statement and the Hindustan Times do not state that Awasthi and Vashisht were arrested. Singh and Aswathi said in their statement that, during the ED search, &#8220;we fully cooperated and provided all relevant information and documentary evidence. We remain willing to extend complete cooperation and furnish any further information required by the competent authorities.&#8221; &#8220;We urge media organisations to report responsibly and avoid speculation. We reiterate our faith in due process and the rule of law,&#8221; they added. Climate Action Network International and its South Asia branch have been contacted for comment.

At COP30, Singh praised the Indian government for turning the &#8220;pressure back on wealthy nations, making it clear that the path to 1.5C requires the Global North to reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and finally deliver the trillions in finance owed&#8221;. In 2020, India passed the Indian Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill which restricted foreign funding for Indian civil society groups. A December 2025 research paper in environmental politics pointed to this as an example of a growing trend among governments to repress climate activists by restricting funding. In 2021, the Indian government arrested young climate activist Disha Ravi on suspicion of sedition for supporting protests by farmers against government policies. Nearly five years later, she remains on bail with conditions preventing her from travelling abroad. India has yet to publish its latest national climate action plan, which it was due to submit to the United Nations climate body in 2025 along with other countries, around 70 of which have yet to do so.
