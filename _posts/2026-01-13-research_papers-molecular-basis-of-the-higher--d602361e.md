Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceCatSper is an essential ion channel that mediates Ca2+influx during sperm hyperactivation, a vital step for successful fertilization. Defective CatSper channels are associated with male infertility. CatSper oligomerizes to form quadrilinear ...
