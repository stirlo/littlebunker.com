Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 5, February 2026. SignificanceAsymmetric division partitions molecules into restricted cellular domains that shape future identities, yet protein profiling in these domains has been limited. We introduce a microprobe capillary electrophoresis ion mobility mass spectrometry ...
