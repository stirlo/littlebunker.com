Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 32, August 2025. SignificanceTumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is an adaptor protein with highly context-dependent functions. Humans with a mutantTRAF3allele have autoimmune disease, immunodeficiencies, and increased risk of B cell ...
