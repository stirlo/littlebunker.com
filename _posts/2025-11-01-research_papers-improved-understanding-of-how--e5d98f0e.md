Abstract Overshooting tops (OTs) are domed protrusions of deep convective updrafts that extend past the anvil of a cumulonimbus. Recent work has shown that OT depth and area may be sensitive to the thermodynamic environment in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS). What remains unknown is the extent to which the UTLS influence on OT characteristics competes with the influence of the tropospheric updraft. This study uses numerical simulations of supercell thunderstorms to test the relative influences of kinematic and thermodynamic environmental changes on updraft characteristics and ultimately, OT area and depth. Results show static stability in the UTLS is important for modulating depth, but not area. Tropospheric vertical wind shear, which is important for controlling the size of a supercell updraft, is shown to be important for the area of the OT but not its depth.
