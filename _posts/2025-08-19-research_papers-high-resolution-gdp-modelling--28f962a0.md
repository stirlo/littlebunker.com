An important prerequisite for accurately characterizing economic exposure from climate change at the national scale is a spatial inventory of economic activity and value creation. Current options for such inventories are limited, being either spatially precise but economically bounded sector-specific or owner-specific datasets, or gridded gross domestic product (GDP) products with coarse spatial resolution and inadequate sectoral resolution. To address these limitations, we develop a map of national GDP with high spatial and sectoral resolution. We stress this with meter-scale flood hazard maps to characterize GDP at risk from flooding. We further couple this to a macroeconomic inputâ€“output analysis to use the new sectoral resolution to estimate the scope of indirect economic exposure to flood at a national scale.
