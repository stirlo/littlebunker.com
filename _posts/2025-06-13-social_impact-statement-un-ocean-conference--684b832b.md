NICE (June 13, 2025) — The third United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC) ended today in Nice, France, after five days of high-level discussions and negotiations. The conference united heads of state, ministers, scientists, Indigenous leaders, youth and civil society to accelerate progress on Sustainable Development Goal 14 — Life Below Water.&nbsp;Key outcomes included renewed support for the High Seas Treaty, rising international calls for a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining and Panama and the Republic of Korea joining the 100% Alliance for sustainable ocean management. With the launch of the ‘Blue NDC Challenge’ France and Brazil urged placing ocean solutions at the core of global climate and development policies — a vital demand for the ocean’s future.&nbsp;Following is a statement from Tom Pickerell, Global Director, Ocean Program, WRI:&nbsp;“There's real momentum coming out of Nice — but also a lot of unfinished business. This was a critical moment to close gaps in ocean protection. While some progress was made, not all governments fully seized it.&nbsp;“After 20 years, the High Seas Treaty is finally within reach. With 51 countries ratified and more pledging to follow, we're just 9 short of the 60 needed for it to enter into force. But that final push didn't happen in Nice — and now pressure is on remaining governments to make it legally binding.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Calls to halt deep-sea mining are growing, with 37 countries now supporting a precautionary pause or outright ban — a hopeful sign of political will to protect fragile ecosystems. But progress on ratifying the agreement to curb harmful fisheries subsidies remains painfully slow, with only Panama joining so far and 9 more ratifications needed. To keep our oceans healthy and fisheries thriving for the future, governments must act urgently.&nbsp;“We can't save the ocean on spare change. Blue finance is finally gaining attention, but we're still $550 billion a year short of what's needed for long-term ocean health. Without urgent investment, we risk accelerating the collapse of marine biodiversity, undermining food security for billions and weakening one of our most powerful buffers against climate change.&nbsp;“Some countries, like Brazil, France, Panama, and South Korea, came to Nice ready to lead — not just talk. But the ocean's fate isn't in their hands alone. If the world doesn't act together now, we could lose the very lifeblood that sustains us all.”&nbsp;Editor’s note: WRI serves as Secretariat of the&nbsp;High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy — a group of 18 heads of state and government from countries committed to sustainably managing 100% of their national waters by 2030 — and coordinates the&nbsp;100% Alliance, a global initiative co-led by Chile and France that encourages all countries to make that commitment.&nbsp;
