Artificial upwelling (AU) of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface ocean has been proposed to increase ecosystem productivity and enhance CO2 uptake. AU is thus considered a marine carbon dioxide removal option among other potential uses. Due to the typical temperature and salinity depth profiles in wide parts of the oceans, a self-sustaining up or downflow within a vertical pipe can be established. This concept was introduced by Stommel et al (1956 Deep Sea Res.3 152–3) as the perpetual salt fountain. Using a one-dimensional numerical performance prediction method for Stommel upwelling pipe (SUP) systems, previously developed and verified by Kemper et al (2025 Appl. Ocean Res.160 104624), several studies on the potential of the SUP concept for AU are reported in the present work. A global assessment of the AU potential of SUP systems is presented, and the spatial and temporal variability of their performance is discussed. Additionally, an overview of upscaling and optimization design considerations for SUP systems is given based on a parametric study. Our results show that considerable parts of the global oceans are suitable for SUP-based AU of nutrients. The highest potential is found in the subtropical ocean gyres. We further find a significant seasonal pattern in the upwelling velocity. Upscaling of SUP systems to achieve practically significant flow rates for AU is found possible.
