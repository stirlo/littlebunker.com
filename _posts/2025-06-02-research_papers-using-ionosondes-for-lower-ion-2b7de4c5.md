Abstract Ionosondes are primarily used to measure the electron densities of the ionosphere's E and F‐region via frequency‐range analysis of the probing signal returns. The amplitude of the returning signal has often been ignored, however, and may allow estimates of other propagation effects such as D and E‐region absorption. We introduce a methodology to extract this information from amplitude data and view results in ensemble with Very Low Frequency‐derived, D‐Region absorption estimates. This comparison allows us to infer what portion of High Frequency (HF) attenuation is due to D‐region versus E‐region absorption. The attenuation observed by both methodologies are congruent with each other in the diurnal cycle across HF frequencies between 2.5 and 4.5 MHz. This technique may extend the utility of ionosondes beyond their traditional applications.
