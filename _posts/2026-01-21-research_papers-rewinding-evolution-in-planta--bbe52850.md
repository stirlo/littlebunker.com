Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 3, January 2026. SignificanceThe inefficiency of the photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco limits crop productivity. A major challenge in improving Rubisco is testing new variants in planta without interference from the native enzyme. We have overcome this problem by creating a ...
