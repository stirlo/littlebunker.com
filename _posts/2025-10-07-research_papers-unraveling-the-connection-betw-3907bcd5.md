Abstract The tectonic stress field induces surface deformation. At long wavelengths, both lithospheric heterogeneity (changes in the thickness and density of crust and lithospheric mantle) and basal tractions from mantle convection contribute to the stress field. Here, we analyze the global alignment of principal horizontal tectonic stresses, fault traces, and river flow directions to infer whether and how deep subsurface stresses control geomorphic features. We find that fault trace orientations are consistent with predictions from Anderson's fault theory. River directions largely align with fault traces and partly with stresses. The degree of alignment depends on fault regime, the source of stress, and river order. Extensional faulting is best predicted by stresses from lithospheric structure variations, while compressive faulting is best predicted by stresses from mantle flow. We propose a metric to quantify the relative influence of mantle flow or lithospheric heterogeneity on surface features, which provides a proxy for lithospheric strength.
