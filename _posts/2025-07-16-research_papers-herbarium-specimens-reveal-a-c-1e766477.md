Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 28, July 2025. SignificanceHere, we show that closely related species that appear to have diverged in their climate niches based on highly differentiated annual conditions are actually tracking very similar seasonal climate conditions. This climate similarity, estimated ...
