GENEVA, Mar 21 – The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is&nbsp; inviting&nbsp; its member governments and accredited observer organizations to nominate experts to serve as Co-Chairs and members of the Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data). A call for nominations of experts by governments and observer organizations to serve as TG-Data members has been launched. Nominations should be submitted by Thursday 17 April 2025 (midnight CEST).



The final
selection of TG-Data members will be undertaken by the IPCC Bureau.



The IPCC
Task Group on data support provides guidance to the IPCC’s Data Distribution Centre on the curation, traceability, stability,
availability and transparency of data and scenarios related to IPCC reports. 



The TG-Data
work mainly requires but is not restricted to data specialists, with a
particular expertise in areas such as data provenance, scientific workflows,
climate data handling systems, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
Reusable) Data principles, and development and/or analysis of climate and
observational datasets. 



TG-Data
membership is renewed with the author selection process of a new assessment IPCC
report. Following the agreement on the outlines of the three Working Group
contributions to the Seventh Assessment Report reached at the Panel´s 62nd
Plenary last month, the IPCC is currently calling for the nomination of
authors for these three Working Group contributions. 



More information on the TG-Data is available here.

Notes
for Editors 



What is the IPCC?



The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) is the UN body for assessing the science related to
climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide
political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate
change, its implications and risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and
mitigation strategies. In the same year the UN General Assembly endorsed the
action by the WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC. It has 195 member
states. 



Thousands of people from all
over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, scientists
and experts volunteer their time as IPCC authors to assess the thousands of
scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of
what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future
risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks. 



The IPCC has three working
groups: Working Group I
dealing with the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II,
dealing with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III,
dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories that develops methodologies for measuring
emissions and removals. 



IPCC assessments provide governments,
at all levels, with scientific information that they can use to develop climate
policies. IPCC assessments are a key input into the international negotiations
to tackle climate change. IPCC reports are drafted and reviewed in several
stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.



About the Seventh Assessment Cycle



Comprehensive
scientific assessment reports are published every 5 to 7 years. The IPCC is
currently in its seventh assessment cycle, which formally began in July 2023
with the elections of the new IPCC and Task Force Bureaus at the IPCC’s Plenary Session in Nairobi.&nbsp; 



At its
first Plenary Session in the seventh assessment cycle &#8211; the 60th
Plenary Session in Istanbul, Türkiye, in January 2024 &#8211; the Panel agreed to
produce in this cycle the three Working Group contributions to the Seventh
Assessment Report (AR7), namely the Working Group I report on the Physical
Science Basis, the Working Group II report on Impacts, Adaptation and
Vulnerability and the Working Group III report on Mitigation of Climate Change.
The Synthesis Report of the Seventh Assessment Report will be produced after
the completion of the Working Group reports and released by late 2029.



During its
62nd Plenary Session held in Hangzhou, China, in February 2025, the
Panel agreed on the outlines of the three Working Group contributions to AR7.



The Panel
decided already during the previous cycle to produce a Special Report on
Climate Change and Cities and a Methodology Report on Short-lived Climate
Forcers during AR7. Scientists have also been asked to deliver a Methodology
Report on Carbon Dioxide Removal Technologies, Carbon Capture Utilization and
Storage.



At the IPCC’s&nbsp; 61st Plenary Session held in Sofia, Bulgaria,
from 27 July to 2 August 2024, the Panel agreed upon the outlines for the Special Report on Climate Change and
Cities scheduled for approval and publication in March
2027 and for the 2027 IPCC Methodology Report on
Inventories for Short-lived Climate Forcers scheduled for
publication in the second half 2027.



In
addition, a revision of the 1994 IPCC Technical Guidelines on impacts and
adaptation as well as adaptation indicators, metrics and guidelines, will be developed
in conjunction with the Working Group II report and published as a separate
product.



IPCC’s
latest report, the Sixth Assessment Report, was completed in March 2023 with
the release of its Synthesis Report, which provided direct scientific input to
the First Global Stocktake process under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change at COP28 in Dubai. 



The Sixth Assessment Report
comprises three Working Group contributions and a Synthesis Report. The Working
Group I contribution Climate Change 2021: the Physical
Science Basis was released on 9 August
2021. The Working Group II contribution, Climate Change 2022: Impacts,
Adaptation and Vulnerability,
was released on 28 February 2022. The Working Group III contribution, Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of
Climate Change, was released on 4 April
2022 and the Synthesis Report on 20 March 2023. The Synthesis Report to the Sixth Assessment Report, distils and
integrates the findings of the three Working Group assessments as well as the
three Special Reports released in 2018 and 2019. 



The special reports were on Global Warming of 1.5°C (October 2018.), Climate Change and Land (August 2019) and, the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate
(September 2019).
