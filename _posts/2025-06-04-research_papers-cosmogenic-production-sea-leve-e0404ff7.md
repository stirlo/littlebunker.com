Abstract We aim to isolate predominantly solar modulated (multi‐decadal to centennial) production changes in a 10Be record from Black Sea sediments covering Termination 2. In addition to the effects of varying climate and sedimentation, sea level rise and tephra‐driven Be relocation introduced non‐production biases into our 10Be (and 9Be) records. These biases were corrected for using normalization (10Be/9Be), regression analysis with proxy time‐series from the same archive (10Beproxy, 10Be/9Beproxy), high‐pass filtering and sample exclusion. The bias‐corrected records exhibit (a) oscillations in the range of the solar Gleissberg (∼90 years) and De Vries (∼220 years) cycles and (b) amplitude changes consistent with centennial‐scale solar variability. This suggests that our 10Be record likely captures solar modulated 10Be production changes, beyond the period presently covered by continuous high‐resolution ice core time‐series.
