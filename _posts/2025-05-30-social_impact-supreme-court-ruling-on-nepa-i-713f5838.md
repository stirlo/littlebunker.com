On Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled to limit the scope of environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In response to the justices’ decision—one that threatens vital protections against harm and pollution from countless future projects—CJA Executive Director KD Chavez issued the following statement: “Imagine approving a new drug without considering its side effects—yet that’s exactly the future the Supreme Court is steering us toward. By gutting the National Environmental Policy Act, the Court is telling us to ignore the full consequences of fossil fuel projects, as if pollution and climate impacts stop at a project’s fence line. Air and water don’t recognize borders, and neither should our reviews. This decision silences community voices and abandons our responsibility to protect public health and the planet. We will continue to push for policies and legal tools that center the health, safety, and rights of people over the convenience of polluting industry.” &nbsp; The post Supreme Court Ruling on NEPA is a Gut Punch to Hard-working Families and Communities appeared first on Climate Justice Alliance.
