Nigeria's future rests in the hands of its youth. As Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria is home to over 230 million people — more than half under the age of 19. Moreover, projections show that 42% of the world's youth will be African by 2030. This means Nigeria's young people will play an outsized role in shaping not just their country's development, but also their continent's and the world's trajectory.This demographic advantage intersects with complex national realities. Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers and among its five largest economies. While the country's oil and gas reserves have catapulted it to stronger economic security, extraction and processing have also led to devastating environmental impacts, from low crop production to high air pollution levels. Nigeria also ranks among the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, facing severe droughts, widespread flooding and wildfires every year.These numbers highlight the country's central challenge: How can Nigeria maintain and diversify economic growth while supporting an expanding population, in a way that will deliver a sustainable future for all?Youth Jobs and Skills: A Defining National PriorityEvery year, 3.5 million young Nigerians enter the labor market — one of the largest waves of youth entering the workforce anywhere in the world. This holds immense potential: By equipping young people with the right skills, the country could supercharge its transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. It also creates pressure: Without workforce preparation, Nigeria risks missing out on the growth opportunities that come with these demographic and economic shifts.To help close this gap, WRI worked with GreenHubAfrica to develop a Youth Environment and Climate Leadership Training Course, with curriculum development guided by an all-youth steering committee and supported by Nigeria's Department of Climate Change in the Federal Ministry of Environment. Participants are trained on five themes aligned with Nigeria's national climate goals. These include climate finance and grant writing, energy access and just transition, green entrepreneurship, climate change and health, and climate negotiations and policy analysis.The courses provided a comprehensive background on critical climate-related topics, preparing youth to better understand their role in supporting Nigeria's climate plans and giving them a competitive edge in the job market. Initially delivered in person in Lagos, the courses were later made freely available online. Over 3,600 courses have been completed to date, a number that continues to grow as more young people access the training. Photo by GreenHubAfrica Amplifying Youth Voices in Climate ActionBuilding on this foundation, WRI partnered with GreenHubAfrica to host a Youth Environment and Climate Leadership Essay Competition, providing young people a platform to translate their knowledge into actionable ideas. Jurors, including representatives from Nigeria's Department of Climate Change, selected winners from across the country's six geopolitical regions. The winning essays showcased a diversity of ideas aimed at addressing Nigeria's climate challenges:Disclaimer: The views and recommendations expressed in these essays reflect the perspectives of the writers. WRI issues recommendations only after careful research, so these essays should not be interpreted as WRI positions.Tamunobarafiri Brown wrote about how decentralizing power generation can unite states within geopolitical zones to harness their renewable energy sources and establish grids in strategic regions: \\"[For example,] the northwestern zone has some of the highest solar radiation levels, making it ideal for solar power. Areas like Sokoto and Katsina have significant wind potential, especially during the Harmattan period [when the northeasterly trade wind blows from the Sahara to West Africa]. Due to the aridity of land in some parts of the northwestern zone, energy farms can be set up.\\"Hafsat Abdilkadir Jalo explored how AI-driven health forecasting, decentralized health hubs and eco-friendly healthcare practices could strengthen the resilience of Nigeria's healthcare system to climate impacts: \\"Pilot projects in the most vulnerable regions, such as the Niger Delta or Northeast Nigeria, could be the first step in implementing decentralized health hubs and AI forecasting. Partnerships with tech companies, NGOs and global health organizations could secure the necessary funding and expertise. Public-private partnerships could overcome barriers related to funding, infrastructure and training.\\"Chidinma Emihe suggested using a podcast as a research and knowledge-building tool to foster dialogues on how to shift to a low-carbon economy in ways that create fair economic opportunities and protect vulnerable communities. She noted: \\"Knowledge deficits are not just technical; they also have psychological and emotional consequences. When communities cannot see viable economic pathways forward, the result is not simply unemployment, but collective uncertainty which manifests as fear, despair and resistance to change.\\"Amarachi Doris Amushi encouraged the use of small-scale biodigesters to convert organic waste into clean energy and natural fertilizer, tackling both pollution and energy shortages while improving soil health and agricultural productivity: \\"In rural areas, farmers can use animal manure and crop waste to generate biogas for cooking and electricity, and bio-slurry to enrich their farmlands.\\"Salim Sanu Haladu focused on the urban heat island effect — where dense buildings and heat-absorbing surfaces make cities significantly warmer — and recommended using aluminum and other heat-reflective roofing as a solution: \\"Aluminum roofing should be given priority because, beyond heat wave relief, it is also cost effective. Aluminum reflects 70% of solar radiation compared to iron's 30%. Though slightly costlier, aluminum lasts twice as long as iron, making it more economical.\\"Sunday Odu proposed a grant-writing fellowship for disadvantaged areas in Nigeria to give young people the tools to write compelling proposals and secure climate funding, noting: \\"The climate crisis is an opportunity, grants are a more viable and sustainable climate finance instrument than concessional loans and debts, and grant writing is an opportunity to break the silos and leave no one behind.\\"These proposals illustrate a remarkable blend of creativity, technical insight and practical solutions — evidence that Nigeria's youth are ready to lead. Policy Foundations for a Youth-Led FutureNigeria's government has ambitious plans to tackle climate change, from its national climate commitment (known as a \\"nationally determined contribution,\\" or \\"NDC\\") under the Paris Agreement, to its 2050 Long-Term Low Emission Vision and National Action Plan to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. These are reinforced by the legally binding 2021 Climate Change Act, which guides the development and implementation of mechanisms to reduce carbon emissions and ensure a more sustainable future, with specific attention to vulnerable groups, including women and youth.Harnessing the energy and innovation of Nigeria's youth to help deliver these goals will require targeted policy support. The success of these ambitious climate plans depends on strong societal buy-in — and in Nigeria, youth engagement is especially vital. The government recognizes this, as reflected in its 2021 National Youth Policy, which focuses on enhancing youth development and participation in the country's sustainable development agenda. In line with the policy's guidelines, the government included consultations with youth in its 2025 NDC revision process. This led to clear cross-sectoral measures and actions in the NDC around engaging and empowering youth.Youth Driving Nigeria's Climate FutureNigeria's youth are not just inheriting the climate challenge — they are shaping solutions. This deep engagement with young people in Nigeria shows that they perceive climate change as a global emergency and are taking strong stands in climate action, demanding their governments do the same. Countries should commit to amplifying youth voices in decision making on climate action through political participation, capacity development, and giving them room to become young innovators.By investing in young people's skills, amplifying their voices, and opening pathways for meaningful leadership, Nigeria can transform its demographic advantage into a sustainable, youth-powered climate future — setting an example for the continent and the world.This article was written in collaboration with Dr. Iniobong Abiola-Awe, Director of the Department of Climate Change in Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Environment.
