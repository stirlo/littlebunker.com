Nature Climate Change, Published online: 13 June 2025; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02352-8Integrated assessment model-based scenarios are commonly used to project future emission pathways but suffer from submission biases and high computational cost. Here researchers develop a deep learning framework to generate synthetic scenarios and replicate key variables across a wide range of mitigation ambitions.
