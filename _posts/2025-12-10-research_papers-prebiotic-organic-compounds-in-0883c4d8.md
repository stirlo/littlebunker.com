Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. SignificanceSamples of asteroid Bennu obtained by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission preserve a record of the chemical evolution of the early Solar System. The organic compounds detected in laboratory analyses of these samples include various building blocks of ...
