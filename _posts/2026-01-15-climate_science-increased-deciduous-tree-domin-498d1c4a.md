Nature Climate Change, Published online: 15 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02539-zMore frequent fires in the North American boreal are causing shifts from conifer to deciduous forests. This study finds that when deciduous forests burn, their carbon losses are driven by weather, but are lower than in conifer forests, potentially dampening climate–fire feedbacks.
