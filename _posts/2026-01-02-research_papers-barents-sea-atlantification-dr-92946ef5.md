Nature Climate Change, Published online: 02 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s41558-025-02535-3The Atlantic Ocean is having an increasing influence on the Arctic but the drivers of this are unclear. By combining ocean modelling and deep learning methods, the authors show that the increased flow through the Barents Sea Opening is driven by spectral changes of atmospheric variability.
