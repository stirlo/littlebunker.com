Abstract The properties of precipitation systems, defined as precipitation features (PFs), are examined in relation to atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the eastern Pacific and western US using 10 years of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data from 2014 to 2024. Strong links are found between PFs—particularly precipitation size (area of the precipitation system) and total rain volumes—and ARs, with Rossby wave breaking (RWB) type. Cyclonic RWB and neutral type produce larger precipitation size and higher volumes of intense rainfall than anticyclonic RWB, particularly at steep southwest and west AR orientation angles. The convective intensity of PFs exhibits a weak correlation with AR intensity, regardless of the RWB type. Precipitable water and low‐level jet are positively associated with AR intensity, cyclonic RWB, and neutral type. Vertical motion is also positively associated but shows more variability. Our findings highlight the importance of the PF‐AR‐RWB relationship for improving extreme precipitation forecasting.
