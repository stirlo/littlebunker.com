Abstract We examine correlations between mercury (Hg) and carbon (C) concentrations and speciation by synthesizing 526 river water samples across three distinct regions in Québec, Canada (48° to 55°N and 62° to 80°W). Positive correlations between methylmercury (MeHg) per unit Hg and C‐gases per unit dissolved organic carbon suggest Hg‐C co‐transformation within rivers. Correlations between MeHg and methane (CH4) concentrations strengthen when adjusted for oxidation, revealing an association that goes beyond the established link between fermentation and Hg methylation in anoxic environments. These correlations persist but are manifested differently across regions. Colder, wetland‐dominated regions indicated stronger terrestrial co‐loading, while warmer and more recently impounded systems exhibited more co‐transformation. These findings emphasize the interconnected biogeochemical cycles of Hg‐C in northern rivers and highlight the importance of landscape characteristics influencing their coupling.
