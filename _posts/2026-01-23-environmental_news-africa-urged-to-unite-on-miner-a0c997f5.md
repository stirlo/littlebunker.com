The individual approach taken by several African countries in negotiating minerals deals with Washington is not in the best interest of the continent, which would benefit from adopting a more united front, a senior trade official told the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. At a panel on how Africa can prosper in the &#8220;new economy&#8221;, Wamkele Mene, secretary-general of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, said African nations risk missing out on the opportunities offered by the global race for critical minerals if they do not coordinate their approach. He said the African Union (AU) has adopted a continental strategy for critical minerals &#8211; which are essential for electrification and the clean energy transition &#8211; but deals are still being done separately.&nbsp; &#8220;If you take, for example, the expiry of AGOA [the African Growth and Opportunity Act] and the fact that individual countries are being pulled to Washington to negotiate individually, that is not in Africa’s interest,” Mene said.&nbsp; Climate at Davos: Energy security in the geopolitical driving seat AGOA, which grants duty-free access to US markets for eligible sub-Saharan African countries, lapsed last autumn, but the US Congress is now in the process of approving an extension through 2028. One argument being used to convince lawmakers is the strategic need for the US to tap more of Africa&#8217;s mineral resources in the face of huge Chinese investments in exploiting the continent&#8217;s reserves. Mene said Africa’s institutional limitations are hampering collective bargaining with trade partners. Unlike the European Union, the AU is not a supranational body with the legal authority to negotiate trade deals on behalf of member states, he noted. Continent-wide minerals strategy ignored Although Africa’s regions have varying mineral assets requiring different perspectives in negotiating investments, there should be basic principles guiding talks with third parties, Mene said. “There’s a strategy document, but the implementation is not AU implementation. I concede that we are not there yet,&#8221; he added.

However, this has not worked in practice as countries continue to pursue bilateral agreements. This week, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) sent Washington a shortlist of state-owned assets – including manganese, copper-cobalt, gold and lithium projects – for US investors to consider as part of a minerals partnership, Reuters reported. And next month, African leaders including from Kenya, the DRC and Guinea are expected in Washington for the inaugural US-led Critical Minerals Ministerial, where they will try to negotiate deals with the US.&nbsp; Climate at Davos: Clean tech powers on despite policy wobbles Echoing Mene’s call, Sierra Leone&#8217;s President Julius Maada Bio argued at Davos that Africa’s lack of coordination weakens its position with foreign investors and limits the continent’s ability to mobilise capital. Investors are wary of Africa’s investment climate, legal systems and profit repatriation rules, he said. “At the same time, what is interesting is that they are never shy to come for our resources &#8211; even with wars,” he added. “But there are a lot of other conditions that keep them away. We do not have collective bargaining power as a continent.”&nbsp; Artisanal miners work at Tilwizembe, a former industrial copper-cobalt mine, outside of Kolwezi, the capital city of Lualaba Province in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, June 11, 2016.

REUTERS/Kenny Katombe Minerals &#8216;not the development path&#8217; for Africa Rachel Glennerster, president of the Center for Global Development, said the rush for minerals as Africa&#8217;s route to development should be approached with caution. While minerals will continue to be an important revenue source, they create few jobs, she noted.&nbsp; “I don’t think it’s the long-term future of an inclusive growth path,” she said, arguing that proceeds from mining minerals should be used to fund education and human development rather than treated as a standalone growth strategy. She urged the continent to look more towards agriculture given its abundance of land and focus on getting reliable electricity to businesses to boost production. At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals Sierra Leone&#8217;s leader Maada Bio stressed that Africa is not yet prepared to capture the full benefits of the energy transition and digital revolution, warning that inadequate infrastructure, unreliable energy supplies and weak connectivity could leave the continent “at the receiving end” of global shifts. While welcoming the growing role of African financial institutions in backing local ventures, he said political leaders should place more value on building a regional market, strengthening economic integration and investing in young people&#8217;s education so they can take advantage of the opportunities. “The people must be ready for it,” he said.
