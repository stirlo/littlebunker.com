Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 35, September 2025. SignificanceMutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 that cause Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) result in the development of RASopathy-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This study shows that in the heart, when SHP2 ...
