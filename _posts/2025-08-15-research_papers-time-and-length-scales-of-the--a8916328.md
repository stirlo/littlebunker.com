Abstract We provide a statistical analysis of the Martian near‐surface atmospheric turbulence based on in situ wind observations from NASA's InSight lander. We focus on the variations in length and time scales of the Martian atmospheric turbulence caused by the diurnal cycle and changes in atmospheric dust loading. We observe that the length and time scales of the turbulence have distinct behaviors before and after the dust storms. Moreover, we report an asymmetric trend in the diurnal evolution of the Martian near‐surface meteorological conditions, with stronger turbulence observed in the planetary boundary layer during late afternoon‐early evening compared to sunrise. We also find that strong nocturnal turbulence can occur following the collapse of the daytime boundary layer under a certain range of dust opacity.
