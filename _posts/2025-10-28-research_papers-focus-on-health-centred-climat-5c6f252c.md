Climate change poses a public health crisis. To simultaneously achieve climate and health goals, the health-centred climate solutions are of great interest to policymakers. Here, we provide an overview of a unique set of 27 papers published in the focus collection on ‘health-centred climate solutions’. We also take stock of recent literature on the health impacts of climate change, the effectiveness of adaptation actions, and the health co-benefits of mitigation actions. First, we summarise the evidence-based climate and health interactions and the quantitative projections of future climate-induced health burdens. Second, we focus on adaptation actions, in particular early warning systems, and how they influence health risks. Third, we synthesise the health co-benefits of mitigation actions through improving not only air quality but also physical activity level, and their distributional effects across regions and population groups. Finally, we point out important gaps in data, modelling frameworks, and topics to be tackled in future research. Through this synthesis, we aim to catalyse a paradigm shift toward health-centred climate solutions that prioritise health benefits while addressing climate change challenges.
