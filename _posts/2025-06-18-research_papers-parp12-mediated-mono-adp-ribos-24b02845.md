Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 24, June 2025. SignificancePARP12 has been implicated in regulating inflammation and antiviral responses. However, the specific substrates and mechanisms of PARP12 action remain unclear. Our research demonstrates that PARP12 catalyzes the mono-ADP-ribosylation (...
