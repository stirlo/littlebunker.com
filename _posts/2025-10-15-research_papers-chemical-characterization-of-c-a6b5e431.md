Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 41, October 2025. SignificanceThis study advances our understanding of the evolutionary timeline for early metazoans, particularly sponges, through the chemical identification of rare C31steranes from Neoproterozoic rocks. We provide compelling evidence linking these ...
