Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 42, October 2025. SignificanceNonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) caused by genetic defects in meiotic genes remains untreatable, as no curative therapies exist for patients lacking male haploid germ cells. Here, we demonstrate that lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated mRNA ...
