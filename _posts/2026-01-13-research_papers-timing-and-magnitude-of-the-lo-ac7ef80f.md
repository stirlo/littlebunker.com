Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 123, Issue 2, January 2026. SignificanceThe rise of atmospheric oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) set the stage for the evolution of complex life. Co-eval marine carbonate sediments preserve a large and long-lived positive carbon isotope (δ13C) excursion, the Lomagundi–...
