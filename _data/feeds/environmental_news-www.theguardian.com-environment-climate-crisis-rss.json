As Britain heats up, we need to look to countries where public spaces work for both children and adults</p><p>There’s nothing like a boiling hot summer with an energetic small child to make you acutely aware of the need for outdoor space. We are lucky to have a garden, albeit an overgrown one that isn’t exactly child-friendly, so, like many parents, we mostly rely on public space in order for him to play and get the huge amount of exercise he needs. And, if you are able-bodied, there’s nothing like having a child to make you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/may/24/brockwell-park-row-raises-age-old-questions-about-rights-to-public-space-music-festivals\">look at public spaces</a> differently.</p><p>Steps instead of ramps. A lack of benches on which to feed a baby, or give a toddler their snack. No shade. No access to toilets or changing tables. Nowhere to fill up a water bottle. No fences or gates dividing pedestrianised space from a busy road, or a deep body of water, or myriad other hazards. These are just some of the things that start to matter. Before your eyes, the urban environment becomes transformed and often inhospitable. Things such as locked playgrounds (I’m looking at you, Camden council – Falkland Place playground has been closed for literally months at this point) have the potential to ruin your morning. In a heatwave, broken splash pads and locked paddling pools (most recent personal disappointments include Brighton and Leamington Spa) feel like acts of particular cruelty.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.
