It is a crucial moment. The UN’s scientists have yet to publish calculations based on the latest round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – as countries’ emissions pledges are known. But Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has called leaders together because it is already clear that the current emissions pledges are nowhere near enough. The Paris 1.5C threshold was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231130-climate-crisis-the-15c-global-warming-threshold-explained\">crossed</a> last year.

Having heavyweights in the room can make all the difference. Ten years ago in Paris, world leaders’ presence proved crucial to securing an ambitious deal. That’s why it is important that Sir Keir Starmer attends. He may not be the most powerful world leader, but his presence is a moral and diplomatic imperative. If King Charles is able to, he ought to go too. Soft power can help to rebuild the spirit of cooperation to keep the hopes in the Paris agreement alive.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/08/the-guardian-view-on-cop30-starmer-must-stop-havering-and-announce-that-hes-going-to-brazil\">Continue reading...</a>",
