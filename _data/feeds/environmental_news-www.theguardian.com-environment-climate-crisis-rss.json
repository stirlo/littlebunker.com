But only a real bargain between rich and poor nations can weather the climate shocks that are coming</p><p>This year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/cop30-deal-inches-closer-to-end-of-fossil-fuel-era-after-bitter-standoff\">agreement</a> lacked a deal to shift away from <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop30-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-belem/\">fossil fuels</a>, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.</p><p>Developing countries are far from united on some issues.

Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to build <a href=\"https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/global-commitments-on-climate-finance-must-be-fulfilled-rizwana\">flood</a> defences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike.
