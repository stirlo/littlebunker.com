Producers need to revive the fresher and lighter vintages that their medieval ancestors once harvested</p><p>These are always anxious weeks in the Bordeaux vineyards, where 15% of France’s wine is grown, including in celebrated places like Chateau Latour and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. In earlier years, this ritual anxiety among the region’s winegrowers had a pleasingly folkloric quality. In the middle of August, the grapes would ripen and their colour start to turn. About 45 days from now, tradition dictates, it will be time to start picking the 2025 vintage. As the wine writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/19/my-hero-jancis-robinson\">Edmund Penning-Rowsell</a> put it: “To pick or not to pick is the most momentous decision in the winemaking year in Bordeaux.”</p><p>This once timeless rhythm is now collapsing. Part of the problem is the <a href=\"https://www.greatwinecapitals.com/wine-stories/climate-change-and-the-future-of-the-bordeaux-blend/\">climate crisis</a>. Bordeaux still benefits from its moderate Atlantic climate. But south-west France is getting much hotter and drier. Even in the Gironde region, maximum temperatures have been close to 40C at times this past week. Adaptation, in the form of hardier grapes and greater crop diversity, feels unavoidable.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-frances-wine-crisis-the-answer-to-claret-could-be-clairet\">Continue reading...</a>",

      "description": "<p>Environmental fiction is booming – but can it move beyond dystopia to a brighter vision of the future?</p><p>Nearly a quarter of a century ago when I published my first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview26\">Haweswater</a>, about the impact of dam-building in north-west England, nature writing felt quite different, at least for me. Several landmark novels about climate apocalypse and survivalism had been published, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/07/books-to-give-you-hope-z-for-zachariah-robert-c-obrien\">Z for Zachariah</a> by Robert C O’Brien and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/08/death-grass-john-christopher\">The Death of Grass</a> by John Christopher, but there was no imperative to write about such things. These stories involved anomalistic catastrophes – a mutated virus, nuclear war – and they were very bleak. They resonated but also seemed unusual. At the other end of the scale, Ben Elton’s Stark had comedically outlined the nature of oligarchic greed, resource consumption, and the ruination we were hurtling towards, while the Bezos and Musk equivalents could head off-world – not quite so funny now.</p><p>The public knew about climate issues, though terminology often stressed them individually – ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, desertification, coral bleaching – rather than total Earth systems breakdown. Disparate, visionary science fictions didn’t indicate a genre movement yet. There was a luxury of choice regarding stories related to nature – no elephant in the room (or polar bear), if you didn’t tackle climate-change concerns.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/16/blue-sky-thinking-why-we-need-positive-climate-novels\">Continue reading...</a>",
