As Britain heats up, we need to look to countries where public spaces work for both children and adults</p><p>There’s nothing like a boiling hot summer with an energetic small child to make you acutely aware of the need for outdoor space. We are lucky to have a garden, albeit an overgrown one that isn’t exactly child-friendly, so, like many parents, we mostly rely on public space in order for him to play and get the huge amount of exercise he needs. And, if you are able-bodied, there’s nothing like having a child to make you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/may/24/brockwell-park-row-raises-age-old-questions-about-rights-to-public-space-music-festivals\">look at public spaces</a> differently.</p><p>Steps instead of ramps. A lack of benches on which to feed a baby, or give a toddler their snack. No shade. No access to toilets or changing tables. Nowhere to fill up a water bottle. No fences or gates dividing pedestrianised space from a busy road, or a deep body of water, or myriad other hazards. These are just some of the things that start to matter. Before your eyes, the urban environment becomes transformed and often inhospitable. Things such as locked playgrounds (I’m looking at you, Camden council – Falkland Place playground has been closed for literally months at this point) have the potential to ruin your morning.

Researchers say high temperatures from Thursday to Sunday would lead to a sharp rise in excess mortality, especially among older people in cities such as London and Birmingham. They forecast the deadliest day as Saturday, with temperatures above 32C and about 266 deaths. These are not abstract figures, but lives cut short by a threat we understand, yet remain unprepared for.</p><p>Young people seem to grasp this. In a YouGov poll last <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/06/18/7cbe8/1\">week</a>, roughly a quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds said they hoped there would be a heatwave – while more than two-fifths of older people welcomed the sunshine. That generational split isn’t just cultural. It reflects an entirely rational anxiety: younger people face a future living in a climate emergency. The generation that caused and benefited from the conditions driving global heating will be gone long before the worst costs – financial, environmental, social – have to be paid.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-extreme-weather-build-national-readiness-or-let-everyday-life-keep-breaking-down\">Continue reading...</a>",
