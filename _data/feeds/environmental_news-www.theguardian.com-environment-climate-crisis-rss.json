But the media’s obsessive focus on the young men allegedly fuelling the rise of the far right isn’t just empirically flawed – it misses a much more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While many surveys show a large gender gap in support of far-right parties and policies, it is <em>young women</em> who stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, as they are turning in ever greater numbers towards the left.</p><p>The idea that young people in general, and young men in particular, disproportionately support the far right has been around for a while.<strong> </strong>In a classic 2012 study, the German political scientist Kai Arzheimer characterised the “typical” voter of far-right parties in Europe as “<a href=\"https://www.kai-arzheimer.com/paper/electoral-sociology-who-votes-for-the-extreme-right-and-why-and-when/\">male, young(ish), of moderate educational achievement</a> and concerned about immigrants and immigration”.<strong> </strong>It is frequently used to explain the rise of Donald Trump, while in Europe there has been an explosion of articles claiming that young people, particularly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy082dn7rkqo\">young men</a>, are “driving far-right support”. But is the recent rise of Europe’s far right truly due to the disproportionate support of young men? And are young people really becoming more rightwing?</p><p>Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of <a href=\"https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=the-far-right-today--9781509536832\">The Far Right Today</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/21/young-men-women-far-right-online-politics-centre-left\">Continue reading...</a>",
