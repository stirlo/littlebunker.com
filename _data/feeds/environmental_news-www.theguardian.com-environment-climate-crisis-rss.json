That summer, unrelentingly hot temperatures <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/heat-wave-and-drought-were-so-devastating-it-had-americans-declaring-god-is-against-us/481031\">killed</a> between 5,000 and 10,000 people, and Yellowstone national park suffered the worst wildfire in its history.</p><p>Amid the disaster, George HW Bush, then Ronald Reagan’s vice-president, met with farmers in Michigan reeling from crop losses.

He acknowledged the reality of intensifying heatwaves – the “greenhouse effect”, to use the scientific parlance of the day – with blunt clarity: the burning of fossil fuels contributed excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, leading to global warming. But though the scale of the problem could seem “impossible”, he assured the farmers that “those who think we’re powerless to do anything about this greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House Effect” – the impact of sound environmental policy for the leading consumer of fossil fuels. Curbing emissions, he said, was “the common agenda of the future”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/04/the-white-house-effect-netflix-documentary-climate\">Continue reading...</a>",
