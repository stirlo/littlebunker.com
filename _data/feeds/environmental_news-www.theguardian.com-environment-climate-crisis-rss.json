Just over 20 kilometres upstream, at the foot of the Pizzo di Brünesc mountain, the river splits in two. This is the upper Maggia valley. To the west runs Val Bavona, with its historic villages of stone-roofed houses. To the east, equally steep and green, is Val Lavizzara. And in the upper reaches of Val Lavizzara, at an altitude of 1,000 metres, is Campo Draione.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/forest-gone-storm-that-moved-a-mountain-climate-crisis-environment\">Continue reading...</a>",
