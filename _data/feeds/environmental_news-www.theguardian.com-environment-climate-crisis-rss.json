      "description": "<p>Environmental fiction is booming – but can it move beyond dystopia to a brighter vision of the future?</p><p>Nearly a quarter of a century ago when I published my first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview26\">Haweswater</a>, about the impact of dam-building in north-west England, nature writing felt quite different, at least for me. Several landmark novels about climate apocalypse and survivalism had been published, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/07/books-to-give-you-hope-z-for-zachariah-robert-c-obrien\">Z for Zachariah</a> by Robert C O’Brien and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/08/death-grass-john-christopher\">The Death of Grass</a> by John Christopher, but there was no imperative to write about such things. These stories involved anomalistic catastrophes – a mutated virus, nuclear war – and they were very bleak. They resonated but also seemed unusual. At the other end of the scale, Ben Elton’s Stark had comedically outlined the nature of oligarchic greed, resource consumption, and the ruination we were hurtling towards, while the Bezos and Musk equivalents could head off-world – not quite so funny now.</p><p>The public knew about climate issues, though terminology often stressed them individually – ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, desertification, coral bleaching – rather than total Earth systems breakdown. Disparate, visionary science fictions didn’t indicate a genre movement yet. There was a luxury of choice regarding stories related to nature – no elephant in the room (or polar bear), if you didn’t tackle climate-change concerns.</p><p>Helm by Sarah Hall (Author) (Faber & Faber, £20).
