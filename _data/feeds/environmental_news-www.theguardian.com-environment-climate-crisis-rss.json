They also say officials’ emissions-increasing and science-suppressing orders have violated the state-created danger doctrine, a legal principle meant to prevent government actors from inflicting injury upon their citizens.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/trump-administration-sued-anti-environment-orders\">Continue reading...</a>",
