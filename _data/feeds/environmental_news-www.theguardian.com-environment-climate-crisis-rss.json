The future must be built on renewables</p><p>Let’s scrap Britain’s successful climate law so we can burn more gas, lose investment and have higher bills. Crazy as it might seem, that is the message of Kemi Badenoch’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/02/kemi-badenoch-vows-to-repeal-climate-change-act\">new energy strategy</a>. The Conservative leader proposes to repeal the 2008 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrp2k3m3deo\">Climate Change Act</a> in favour of a plan to “maximise oil and gas extraction”, and remove all legally binding carbon targets.

In <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-why-expensive-gas-not-net-zero-is-keeping-uk-electricity-prices-so-high/\">Europe</a>, they don’t – that’s why bills are lower there. Rather, Mrs Badenoch is choosing to follow <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/04/business/power-prices-trump-inflation\">Donald Trump</a> in rolling back climate goals and seeing electricity prices in the US rise, not fall.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
