Usually I say, in the nicest possible way, that I don’t want to: sure, kids are much more annoying when they’re not at school; yes, it’s irresponsible to fly; no, Christmas isn’t magic, it’s an orgy of overconsumption; yes, Easter was pillaged from pagans (probably?), and Christianity itself is the imperialist template (arguably?) – in which case, the last way we should mark it is with a <a href=\"https://www.cadbury.co.uk/products/cadbury-creme-egg-40g/\">Creme Egg</a>.

Urgent, coordinated investment is needed to protect lives and infrastructure</p><p></p><p>Britain’s four-day heatwave – made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/20/england-weekend-heatwave-worse-climate-crisis\">100 times more likely</a> by the climate crisis – is expected to claim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/21/heatwave-expected-deaths-england-and-wales-analysis\">about 600 lives</a>. Researchers say high temperatures from Thursday to Sunday would lead to a sharp rise in excess mortality, especially among older people in cities such as London and Birmingham. They forecast the deadliest day as Saturday, with temperatures above 32C and about 266 deaths. These are not abstract figures, but lives cut short by a threat we understand, yet remain unprepared for.</p><p>Young people seem to grasp this. In a YouGov poll last <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/06/18/7cbe8/1\">week</a>, roughly a quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds said they hoped there would be a heatwave – while more than two-fifths of older people welcomed the sunshine. That generational split isn’t just cultural. It reflects an entirely rational anxiety: younger people face a future living in a climate emergency. The generation that caused and benefited from the conditions driving global heating will be gone long before the worst costs – financial, environmental, social – have to be paid.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-extreme-weather-build-national-readiness-or-let-everyday-life-keep-breaking-down\">Continue reading...</a>",
