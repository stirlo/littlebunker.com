I’ve wanted to be a pilot since I was young. I grew up in Chichester, West Sussex, under a flight path used by Gatwick airport planes, and used to watch as they traversed the sky. In 2019, once I had qualified as an airline pilot, I began working for easyJet. Aviation connected me to my extended family in Canada, exposed me to different cultures and gave me an unforgettable career. But in November 2022, I handed over my airport ID card for the last time. I had grown increasingly anxious about the effect that our industry was having on the planet and, deep down, I knew that my concern for the climate crisis meant being an airline pilot was damaging my mental health.</p><p>Despite no longer working in the industry, my love of aviation has driven me to protect our ability to fly for future generations. It inspires me to address the uncomfortable realities and decisions our industry now faces. Everyone knows that aviation has a gigantic emissions problem. In 2022, the UK’s domestic and international flights produced 29.6m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions, accounting for about 7% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions. This is projected to increase to <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8826/\">11% by 2030</a>, because while other sectors are decarbonising, aviation emissions will remain stable or even increase.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/pilot-climate-crisis-aviation-industry-flying\">Continue reading...</a>",
