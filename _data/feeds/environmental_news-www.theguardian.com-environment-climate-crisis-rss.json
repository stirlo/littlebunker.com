But the media\u2019s obsessive focus on the young men allegedly fuelling the rise of the far right isn\u2019t just empirically flawed \u2013 it misses a much more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While many surveys show a large gender gap in support of far-right parties and policies, it is <em>young women</em> who stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, as they are turning in ever greater numbers towards the left.</p><p>The idea that young people in general, and young men in particular, disproportionately support the far right has been around for a while.<strong> </strong>In a classic 2012 study, the German political scientist Kai Arzheimer characterised the \u201ctypical\u201d voter of far-right parties in Europe as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.kai-arzheimer.com/paper/electoral-sociology-who-votes-for-the-extreme-right-and-why-and-when/\">male, young(ish), of moderate educational achievement</a> and concerned about immigrants and immigration\u201d.<strong> </strong>It is frequently used to explain the rise of Donald Trump, while in Europe there has been an explosion of articles claiming that young people, particularly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy082dn7rkqo\">young men</a>, are \u201cdriving far-right support\u201d.
