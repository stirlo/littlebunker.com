It wasn’t until he was 30 that he finally went to a doctor after waking up from a particularly big night of snoring with a racing heartbeat. Despite being young, active and a healthy weight, further investigation – including a night recording his snoring – revealed that he had moderate sleep apnoea. His was classed as supine, the most common form of the condition, meaning it happens when he sleeps on his back, and is likely caused by his throat muscles.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/feb/07/deafening-draining-and-potentially-deadly-are-we-facing-a-snoring-epidemic\">Continue reading...</a>",
