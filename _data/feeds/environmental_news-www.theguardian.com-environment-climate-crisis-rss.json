But the UN secretary general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/22/antonio-guterres-climate-breakthrough-clean-energy-fossil-fuels\">António Guterres</a>, struck an optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the cusp of a new era ... The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030.</p><p>Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand action from US businesses at this point.

This era did all too well in convincing people that if we did what the climate needs of us, we would be entering an era of austerity and renunciation, and it helped power the fossil fuel industry’s weaponization of climate footprints to make people think personal virtue in whittling down our consumption was the key thing.</p><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.
