Researchers say high temperatures from Thursday to Sunday would lead to a sharp rise in excess mortality, especially among older people in cities such as London and Birmingham. They forecast the deadliest day as Saturday, with temperatures above 32C and about 266 deaths. These are not abstract figures, but lives cut short by a threat we understand, yet remain unprepared for.</p><p>Young people seem to grasp this.

That generational split isn’t just cultural. It reflects an entirely rational anxiety: younger people face a future living in a climate emergency.
