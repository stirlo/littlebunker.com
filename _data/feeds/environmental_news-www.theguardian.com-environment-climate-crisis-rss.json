They are dark and shift slightly, mirroring our movements, but not enough to feel we are the same thing. We’re not. They are strangers, watching. Freud may have called them doppelgangers: uncanny versions of our repressed selves. Jung may have seen them as unconscious personalities that we project on to others because of the struggles we have with ourselves.
