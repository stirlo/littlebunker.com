[But] they don’t really know what is the problem really. They’re taking the decisions from their own mind and the problem is that they’re far from reality.</p><p>That’s why we decided to alert the people in the world about [our] problems: water coming up, getting enough to eat, more heat – in some parts of French Guiana, people don’t have water.</p><p>These crises, a consequence of Western capitalist madness, primarily affect the most vulnerable: women and communities dependent on forests and rivers. But they also concern all of humanity: French Guiana is part of the Amazon, a regulator of the global climate and essential to planetary balance.</p><p>We remind you that French Guiana is the last colony in South America without self-determination. We will not be able to protect our environment or guarantee our food and energy self-sufficiency, essential for our collective survival, as long as decisions are made in Paris without consulting the affected communities or taking into account local specificities.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2025/nov/20/cop30-live-news-updates-belem-brazil-president-lula\">Continue reading...</a>",
