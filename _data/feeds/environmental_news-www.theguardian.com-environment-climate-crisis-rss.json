The Conservative leader proposes to repeal the 2008 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czrp2k3m3deo\">Climate Change Act</a> in favour of a plan to “maximise oil and gas extraction”, and remove all legally binding carbon targets.

Rather, Mrs Badenoch is choosing to follow <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/04/business/power-prices-trump-inflation\">Donald Trump</a> in rolling back climate goals and seeing electricity prices in the US rise, not fall.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yuval Noah Harari is an Israeli medieval and military historian best known for his panoramic surveys of human history, including <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sapiens-9780099590088/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article\">Sapiens</a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/homo-deus-9781784703936/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article\">Homo Deus</a> and, most recently, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nexus-9781529933611/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article\">Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI</a>. Maria Ressa, joint winner of the Nobel peace prize, is a Filipino and American journalist who co-founded the news website Rappler. And Rory Stewart is a British academic and former Conservative MP, writer and co-host of The Rest Is Politics podcast. Their conversation ranged over the rise of AI, the crisis in democracy and the prospect of a Trump-Putin wedding, but began by considering a question central to all of their work: how to live a good life in an increasingly fragmented and fragile world?</p><p><strong>YNH</strong> People have been arguing about this for thousands of years. The main contribution of modern liberalism and democracy was to try to agree to disagree; that different people can have very different concepts of what a good life is, and they can still live together in the same society, agreeing on some very basic rules of conduct. And the challenge was always that people who think they have the absolute answer to what is a good life try to impose it on others, partly because, unfortunately for many ideologies, an inherent part of the good life is attempting to make everybody live it. And even more unfortunately, in many cases, it seems that it is easier to impose it on others than to do it ourselves. If we take the original crusade in medieval Christian Europe, you have all these people who can’t live a Christian life of modesty and compassion and love your neighbour, but they are able to travel thousands of kilometres to kill people and try to force them to live according to these principles. And what we are witnessing in the world right now is more of the same.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/04/how-to-live-a-good-life-in-difficult-times-yuval-noah-harari-rory-stewart-and-maria-ressa-in-conversation\">Continue reading...</a>",
