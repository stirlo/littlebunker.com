But the UN secretary general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/22/antonio-guterres-climate-breakthrough-clean-energy-fossil-fuels\">António Guterres</a>, struck an optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the cusp of a new era ... The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030.</p><p>Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand action from US businesses at this point.

This era did all too well in convincing people that if we did what the climate needs of us, we would be entering an era of austerity and renunciation, and it helped power the fossil fuel industry’s weaponization of climate footprints to make people think personal virtue in whittling down our consumption was the key thing.</p><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Yet these figures obscure the truth of such events. They make the outcome seem fixed, somehow proportionate. But disasters are chaotic. Their extreme violence magnifies the consequences of every decision: to stay or to move; to run or to hide. Things could have turned out another way. And how would we talk about them then?</p><p>In Locarno, Switzerland, on the northern shore of Lake Maggiore, lies the mouth of the Maggia river. Follow it north-west and it winds past sandy, tree-shaded beaches, through rocky gorges and into a broad, glacial valley where, for much of the year, long waterfalls drop down forested mountainsides. Just over 20 kilometres upstream, at the foot of the Pizzo di Brünesc mountain, the river splits in two. This is the upper Maggia valley. To the west runs Val Bavona, with its historic villages of stone-roofed houses. To the east, equally steep and green, is Val Lavizzara. And in the upper reaches of Val Lavizzara, at an altitude of 1,000 metres, is Campo Draione.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/forest-gone-storm-that-moved-a-mountain-climate-crisis-environment\">Continue reading...</a>",
