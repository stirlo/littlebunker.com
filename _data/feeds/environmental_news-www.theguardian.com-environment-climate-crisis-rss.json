Seven of the nine planetary boundaries are now breached, with ocean acidification added to the danger list. Yet the world has proved that cooperation works: the ozone layer is healing, air pollution controls are working. A decisive test looms at the end of the month, when governments must file new climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This is no time to ease off: the fossil-fuel era must end, and the clean‐energy transition must accelerate.</p><p>There is real concern that big emitters, <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/policies-action/\">including Australia</a> and the EU, will fall short of what is needed to avoid extreme heating. The EU is set to miss this month’s NDC deadline, while most <a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/articles/insight/ndcs-fossil-fuel-production-emissions-finance\">fossil-fuel producers</a> plan to cut emissions at the margins instead of phasing out production.
