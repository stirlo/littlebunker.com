      "description": "IntroductionIn regions where climate change is perceived to be a controversial topic, people often self-silence rather than explore their concerns by speaking with others in their local social networks. The “spiral of silence” is a social feedback loop in which individuals are reluctant to speak about an issue because they believe they hold a minority opinion, leading to anxiety and fear, which prohibit action. Facilitating conversations about climate change is therefore a crucial step for researchers concerned with enhancing adaptive capacity. The goal of this paper is to provide a road map for engaging rural communities in conversations about their lived experiences with and local knowledge related to climate and water-related risks (e.g., drought). Our research focuses on unwinding the spiral of silence through community engagement to address the following questions: 1. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive recent climate conditions and water-related risks; and 2. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive and discuss future climate scenarios?MethodsOur first research question is addressed through analysis of results from a statewide survey, which are used to develop prompts for a scenario planning workshop to support the second research question. Our second research question is addressed through transcription and coding of recorded discussions and responses during and after participatory scenario planning workshops in key communities around the state.ResultsResults from the statewide survey indicate that respondents largely agree that all seasons are getting warmer than in the past and that drought is the dominant water risk of concern; however, there is uncertainty about community preparedness. Inclusion of prompts in our participatory scenario planning workshops that were aligned with statewide survey results allowed shared communication opportunities among community members and identified local knowledge of past drought events and associated adaptation strategies for the future.DiscussionOur mixed-method approach provides an example for unwinding the spiral of silence in rural communities experiencing challenges and impacts of climate change.",

      "description": "This study aimed to evaluate precipitation estimates over the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) using high-resolution historical simulations from the MPI-ESM1-2-HR climate model, before and after regionalization with the RegCM4.7.1 model. Continuous 32-year simulations (1981-2012) were compared against observed precipitation data on a regular 0.5° × 0.5° grid over the BLA. Six experiments were conducted: (1) MPI, comparing raw MPI-ESM1-2-HR precipitation with observations; (2) REG, comparing regionalized MPI-ESM1-2-HR precipitation via RegCM4.7.1 with observations; and (3-6) four experiments applying two bias correction methods, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and principal component regression (PCR), to the MPI and REG out-puts, resulting in MPI-CCA, MPI-PCR, REG-CCA, and REG-PCR experiments. Monthly evaluations revealed very low average correlations (r) between the uncorrected simulations and observations: 0.008 for MPI and 0.013 for REG, with mean ab-solute errors (MAE) of 80 mm and 120 mm, and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 97 mm and 143 mm, respectively, indicating poor representation of observed climatology. However, the application of CCA and PCR substantially improved the simulations. MPI-CCA achieved r = 0.36, MAE = 43 mm, and RMSE = 54 mm, while REG-CCA reached r = 0.41, MAE = 42 mm, and RMSE = 53 mm. The best performance was observed with PCR: MPI-PCR showed r = 0.47, MAE = 40 mm, and RMSE = 51 mm, whereas REG-PCR obtained the highest accuracy with r = 0.52, MAE = 39 mm, and RMSE = 50 mm. These improvements were corroborated by Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) analysis, reinforcing its value as a metric for precipitation simulation assessment. Among all months, REG-PCR achieved superior correlation and lower errors in 8 out of 12 months (February, March, April, July, September, October, November, and December). MPI-PCR performed better in January, June, and August, while REG-CCA stood out only in May. These findings underscore the importance of bias correction, particularly PCR, in reducing uncertainties in future precipitation projections for the BLA. The results highlight the potential for applying PCR to model outputs to improve projections of climate extremes, thereby supporting strategic planning across multiple sectors in this critical region.",

      "description": "Climate change is already upon us. Millions of people are expected to be displaced due to the severe and slow-onset impacts. These displacements will lead to large-scale movements from high-risk and less resilient areas to safer or more resilient areas, creating a relocation problem: where people should go and when. This complex problem involves factors such as the source and extent of relocation demand, identification and capacity of destinations, movements from origins to destinations, and the well-being and dignity of both the displaced and receiving communities. We intend to solve the resulting relocation problem at different levels, starting with high-level decisions about which destinations to choose and how many people to send there. This will facilitate early preparations, such as infrastructure and service planning, at these destinations, ensuring timely action without delays. But in such a complicated problem, what could be the measure of the success of certain relocation decisions compared to others? We consider it requisite that the level of social integration at the destination locations and the fairness of the flow decisions are pivotal to a successful relocation plan and should be thoroughly analyzed. The moral imperative of fairness in these decisions cannot be overstated. That is why our study focuses on the fairness of movements within the context of a relocation problem: how many people from each origin should go to each climate destination in a way that is fair for both climate migrants and receiving communities. To this end, we formulate an optimization model such that the objectives and constraints reflect the key aspects of the relocation problem to assign the number of people to be relocated from each origin to each destination. The model incorporates multiple fairness metrics into objectives representing the perspectives of different stakeholders. These metrics are then analyzed and compared to evaluate trade-offs in the results.",

      "description": "Electrochemical technology can be used to remove inorganic carbon from seawater and facilitate the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Electrochemical ‘Direct Ocean Carbon Capture and Storage’ (DOCCS) is a marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) method that removes atmospheric CO2 by releasing low-carbon seawater into the surface ocean, where it re-equilibrates with the atmosphere and stores atmospheric CO2. At the point of release, DOCCS discharge has low concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and high pH, potentially causing unintended marine environmental impacts; however, its chemistry moves progressively towards that of ambient seawater as it dilutes and re-equilibrates with the atmosphere. To date, there are no published studies that investigate the impact of DOCCS discharge on marine ecosystems. Research from relevant analogues, where biological responses to low-DIC and/or high-pH seawater are investigated, provides some insight into potential DOCCS impacts. Despite this, significant evidence gaps remain. These evidence gaps are discussed alongside DOCCS-specific recommendations for future environmental impact research. Understanding the potential risks/benefits to marine ecosystems from discharge of low-DIC and high-pH seawater is critical to: (i) support licensing applications; (ii) develop any necessary mitigating actions; (iii) determine the net benefit of mCDR approaches; and (iv) stimulate informed public discourse about the acceptability of such approaches.",

This scoping review examines recent research trends (2018–2023) on the health impacts of climate change in the Philippines, building on previous national reviews and situating findings within global evidence.MethodsWe screened 8,346 articles from various databases and identified 69 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Using a framework-guided thematic synthesis, studies were categorized into 6 themes: vulnerability to disease and injury, direct health impacts of climate and weather, ecosystem-mediated impacts, health impacts mediated through human institutions, adaptation strategies, and co-benefits of mitigation measures.ResultsResults reveal a significant increase in climate-health research compared to a previous review (1980–2017), with notable growth in studies in mental health, gender-based vulnerabilities, and adaptation measures. However, research remains geographically concentrated in Luzon, highlighting regional disparities, and few studies utilized long-term climate-health datasets. Studies quantifying the health co-benefits of mitigation measures also remain limited.DiscussionThis review demonstrates significant progress while identifying persistent gaps. Future research should prioritize long-term surveillance, local adaptation evaluations and health-economic co-benefits studies to strengthen climate-health data integration, improve climate information services and develop equity-oriented, policy-relevant research agenda.",

This community case study examines how Nantucket is enhancing its resilience by adapting to increasing coastal storms, erosion, and sea level rise through strategic retreat and relocation. Nantucketers have historically moved structures such as lighthouses and homes away from the coastline, but the increasing frequency and intensity of storms demand more comprehensive and adaptable solutions. Through resilience planning and policy efforts, the Town of Nantucket is addressing these challenges by balancing short- and long-term objectives, public and private interests, and equity considerations. Lessons learned from Nantucket’s experiences are applicable to other communities facing similar coastal risks, highlighting the importance of strategic planning, community support, and capacity building for effective retreat and relocation.",

      "description": "What happens to floodplain buyout sites after demolition of structures? Does ecological restoration or reconciliation of the floodplain occur? By what criteria should we assess what is on the site? Under what conditions do government programs promote more ecologically dynamic land management? We explore these questions in the context of four exemplary buyout programs in the United States that implement relocation out of flood risk zones through buyouts: Austin’s Watershed Protection Department, Texas; Harris County Flood Control District, Texas; Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s Stormwater Services, North Carolina; and Washington State’s Floodplains by Design. The analysis draws on staff interviews and GIS mapping, satellite imagery for 3,416 buyout parcels spanning 2,811 acres, and selected field verification. We test a framework for assessing buyouts that includes both pre- and post-buyout considerations as indicators along a spectrum from reconciliation to restoration. Our findings show that the status of most buyout parcels is “in-waiting,” as land management practices evolve to decide on their long-term use. Federal buyout requirements prevent redevelopment, but it is local and state priorities, goals, capacities, partnerships and levels of community engagement that shape land management outcomes and long-term human-nature relations. While the reconciliation-restoration debate often pits social against ecological goals, we find that they are mutually reinforcing, and that deep community engagement yields better outcomes overall. Floodplains are high value landscapes and should be prioritized for repair. State and federal governments can help achieve greater ecological and social outcomes from buyout sites by issuing more explicit guidance, technical assistance, and funding support to achieve these aims.",

      "description": "Given the pivotal role of climate risk in fostering sustainable corporate growth, this factor warrants further investigation in the context of low-carbon innovation. Drawing on firm-level data from Chinese enterprises during the 2007–2022 period, our research establishes climate risk as a significant driver of corporate low-carbon innovation, with transition risk proving more influential than physical risk. The analysis of underlying mechanisms reveals that climate risk stimulates low-carbon technological innovation primarily through two channels: increased research and development expenditures and enhanced environmental certification efforts. Examination of heterogeneous effects demonstrates that climate risk’s innovation-enhancing potential is particularly pronounced among three distinct groups: enterprises not designated as key pollution monitoring units, firms operating in less polluting industries, and businesses located in China’s eastern regions. These insights provide valuable implications for policymakers and businesses on leveraging climate risk to drive low-carbon innovation while achieving balanced sustainable development in terms of Research and Development investment and pollution control dimensions.",

      "description": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at gigaton-scale is essential to meet the Paris climate goals. Relevant CDR rates can only be achieved through the co-deployment of multiple CDR approaches. However, synergisms between different CDR methods and joint co-benefits beyond CDR have seldom been investigated. The combination of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) and enhanced weathering of minerals (Mi) for carbon capture and storage (CCS), in short PyMiCCS, presents a potentially synergetic and multifunctional approach that may be achieved by either co-application of biochar and rock powder to soils or the co-pyrolysis of biomass and rock powder before soil use. Here, we mixed biomass (wood; straw) with 10 to 50 wt% silicate rock powder (namely basanite or diabase) for co-pyrolysis to produce twelve different rock-enhanced (RE-)biochars. Products were subject to physico-chemical characterization, including an assessment of carbon yield and proxies for biochar persistence. Rock-enhanced biochars showed higher nutrient content, liming- and C-sink potential but lower solid-state electrical conductivity and porosity compared to pure biochars. Co-pyrolysis resulted in a coating of rock particles with secondary char but did not affect the net carbon yield. The thermal stability of wood-based RE-biochars (+10 wt% rock) was higher than that of pure woody biochars. However, the underlying mechanism and implications for biochar persistence in the environment need further investigation. Despite the addition of rock powder, the short-term release of ions from the ash fraction remains dominated by cations and anions of biogenic (biochar) origin. Therefore, it is still unclear whether the pyrogenic coating influences rock weathering. Co-pyrolysis with rock dust opens further options for designing biochar properties and to produce novel composite materials catering for multifunctional CDR.",

Barriers to CIS success include poor digital infrastructure, low literacy rates, and gender biases, hindering effective use.Discussion“Why” these approaches fail is due to disconnect between services offered and actual needs of farmers, with a lack of trust in externally provided information. In conclusion, CIS can significantly contribute to agricultural resilience if designed to be inclusive, context-specific, and participatory. The study recommends scaling up participatory models, enhancing digital infrastructure, and integrating CIS into national agricultural policies to improve accessibility, usability, and farmer engagement, thereby strengthening climate adaptation and resilience in SSA.",

      "description": "Flooding presents a significant challenge in the Lagos metropolis, driven by rapid urbanization, poor drainage infrastructure, and climate change. This study evaluates flood resilience strategies in Lagos, analyzing their effectiveness in mitigating flood risks and their alignment with the 2030 Agenda. The research utilizes the PICO (Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes) framework to refine research questions and follows PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines for study selection, search strategies, and data extraction. A thorough search across databases such as Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and government data repositories was conducted to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies while minimizing selection bias. The study emphasizes the severe impacts of flooding, referencing the 2022–2023 flood event which resulted in USD 262,500 damages and displaced 8000 residents in Lagos State. Current flood resilience strategies are inadequate to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to insufficient urban flood infrastructure, poor waste disposal practices, and worsening climatic conditions. The livelihoods, income, health, and overall survival of vulnerable communities are at significant risk. Key gaps identified include the weak enforcement of urban planning regulations, limited community engagement, ineffective early warning systems, and poor intervention initiatives. This study suggests a multi-stakeholder approach that enhances both structural and non-structural flood resilience. Improving drainage systems, promoting sustainable waste management, improving climate adaptation policies, and fostering community-based flood mitigation strategies are crucial for achieving long-term urban resilience. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and climate resilience advocates working toward the Sustainable Development Agenda in Lagos metropolis.",

      "description": "Despite the growing body of scientific literature on mainstreaming climate change adaptation (CCA) into urban planning and numerous implementation guidelines, adaptation remains insufficiently integrated across sectors and scales in urban development, particularly in cities in the Global South. Persisting challenges are conceptual ambiguity, lengthy and overwhelming manuals and guidelines not tailored to planners' needs, and the limited transferability of case study findings especially for cities in the Global South. This study addresses these gaps by developing a pragmatic mainstreaming protocol tailored for urban policymakers and planners to facilitate the mainstreaming of CCA into urban development planning. It provides information and guidance regarding four key elements of mainstreaming: policy formulation, planning, resource allocation and implementation. The protocol was piloted in Metro Manila, the Philippines, focusing on enhancing the integration of upgrading and resettlement as adaptation strategies in urban development planning. They contribute to the ongoing debate on whether mainstreaming of adaptation into general urban planning is more effective than dedicated adaptation policies. This work highlights the need for coherent policies, clear roles, and cross-sectoral collaboration to ensure resilient urban development in vulnerable regions.",

      "description": "Extreme heat events have increased in frequency, intensity and duration over the last several decades as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Extreme heat events impact human and natural systems including human mortality and morbidity, agricultural and livestock yields, ecosystem vulnerability and water resource management. Increasing risks from climate change has prompted an increase in research into the potential impacts—both good and bad—of climate intervention. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is one of the most studied methods of climate intervention and could quickly cool or stabilize global temperatures by injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere. We investigate future projections of a type of extreme heat event, called a warm spell, in the context of a policy relevant and moderate emissions scenario (SSP2–4.5) and SAI deployment simulated in two Earth-system models: CESM2 and UKESM1. Warm spells are prolonged periods of anomalously high temperature that can occur at any time of the year. Under SSP2–4.5 warm spells are projected to become increasingly frequent, intense and longer in both models. SAI deployment is able to effectively mitigate many of these changes; however, differences in future projections of warm spells between CESM2 and UKESM1, regardless of whether or not SAI is deployed, highlight the importance of inter-model comparisons in assessments of future climates.",

      "description": "Coastal communities face increasing flood risks due to sea level rise and climate change, necessitating more proactive risk reduction strategies. Pre-disaster relocations, supported by government subsidies, offer a potentially cost-effective solution, enabling at-risk homeowners to relocate before catastrophic losses occur. This study estimates the potential effectiveness and equity implications of two pre-disaster relocation strategies using an optimization framework and high-resolution flood risk and structural data from Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan. Our findings indicate that a total investment of about $8 billion US in pre-disaster relocations could achieve approximately $0.5 billion in flood risk reduction annually over the next 50 years, with greater benefits in later years corresponding to increasing hazard as sea levels rise. Subsidies are allocated proportionally to flood risk, ensuring procedural fairness, though potential distributional inequities remain. While pre-disaster relocation strategies improve cost-effectiveness and risk mitigation, they do not fully resolve barriers to relocation, including housing affordability, community attachment, and structural inequities in flood exposure. This study provides quantitative insights into relocation feasibility and trade-offs, informing future research on adaptive relocation strategies and equity-focused flood mitigation policies.",

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that nine factors directly influence GEI, namely, self-efficacy (SE), attitude toward entrepreneurship, SN, perceived behavioral control, green industry awareness, entrepreneurship education, social persuasion, capital sources, and personality traits. In addition, the study highlights the mediating role of SE in linking the variables of TPB and SCT to GEI. The findings provide practical recommendations for policymakers and educational institutions to promote green entrepreneurship through targeted education, financial support, and enhanced social networks.",

      "description": "BackgroundEmerging evidence suggests that greenness may be beneficial to human health; however, the relationship between greenness exposure and childhood allergic rhinitis (AR) is inconsistent, and whether and how the link is moderated or mediated by meteorological factors and air pollutants remains unclear.MethodsWe conducted an observational study in Sanya, China. Information on AR and covariates was collected from e-questionnaires. Greenness exposure was assessed using satellite-estimated data based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Binomial generalized linear models with a log link were used to evaluate the associations between greenness exposure and childhood AR, presented as prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in greenness, adjusting for potential confounders. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were also performed.ResultsOf the 9,754 children included in the study, the prevalence of ever AR (EAR) and current AR (CAR) was 15.6 and 23.2%, respectively. An IQR increase in greenness was associated with an attenuated PR of childhood AR. The PRs (95% CIs) were 0.95 (0.88–1.02), 0.94 (0.88–1.00), 0.94 (0.89–0.99), and 0.95 (0.90–0.99) for EAR-NDVI, EAR-EVI, CAR-NDVI, and CAR-EVI, respectively. Furthermore, these associations existed only in boys [PRs (95% CIs) were 0.92 (0.85–0.99), 0.92 (0.85–0.98), and 0.93 (0.88–0.99) for EVI-EAR, NDVI-CAR, and EVI-CAR, respectively], and low-temperature groups [PRs (95% CIs) were 0.89 (0.80–0.99), 0.87 (0.78–0.97), 0.91 (0.84–0.98), and 0.92(0.85–0.99) for NDVI-EAR, EVI-EAR, NDVI-CAR, and EVI-CAR, respectively]. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were found to mediate these associations.ConclusionGreenness exposure seems to reduce the prevalence ratio of childhood AR. These associations may be more pronounced in boys and in low-temperature groups and were mediated by ambient temperature and relative humidity. These findings offer new perspectives for considering ambient temperature and relative humidity in relation to greenness exposure and children’s health.",

      "description": "Enhancing transportation total-factor carbon productivity constitutes a critical initiative for high-quality economic development across Chinese provinces. Based on panel data from 30 Chinese provinces spanning 2007–2022, this study comprehensively employs the Super-Efficiency Slack-Based Measure (SBM) model, non-parametric kernel density estimation, standard deviational ellipse, and global Moran's I index to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of Total Factor Carbon Productivity in Transportation (TFCP-T) across provinces. Finally, a spatial Durbin model is utilized to empirically investigate influencing factors. Key findings include: (1) China's provincial TFCP-T exhibits an overall fluctuating upward trend, yet reveals a distinct spatiotemporal differentiation pattern characterized by “high efficiency and intensification in the eastern region versus gradient lag in the central and western regions.” (2) Significant spatial positive correlation and club convergence effects exist in China's transportation green total factor productivity, with western provinces facing risks of low-level lock-in. (3) Economic development level, openness to foreign trade, environmental protection intensity, and industrial structure upgrading positively promote TFCP-T, while consumption level and informatization level exert significant inhibitory effects. These results provide critical policy insights for enhancing transportation carbon productivity and fostering regional coordinated development in China.",
