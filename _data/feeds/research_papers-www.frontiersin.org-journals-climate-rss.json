      "description": "Critical infrastructure (CI), such as healthcare facilities, schools, and the road network, plays a vital role in society by providing essential services that sustain the functioning of communities. Disruptions to this infrastructure can have profound consequences, affecting public health, safety, economic activities, and general well-being. Weather extremes, including tropical cyclones (TCs), are major drivers of such disruptions, causing widespread failures to power, communication, transportation, and healthcare. Forecasting the potential impact of weather events on these services in the weeks to days before landfall is crucial to enhance preparedness and enable effective anticipatory actions. Unlike previous efforts that focused primarily on estimating the potentially affected population, this research shifts attention to evaluating direct and indirect impacts on CI, and to capture the uncertain nature of impact forecasts depending on lead-time. The methodology, which relies entirely on open-source code and data, yields several metrics quantifying the impact of ensemble-based tropical cyclone (TC) wind forecasts on healthcare access, including the number of hospitals directly affected and the number of people indirectly affected due to disrupted access to healthcare facilities. We apply this approach to TCs Idai, Kenneth, and Freddy, which have struck Mozambique since 2019. The results highlight the extent of indirect effects on the population from infrastructure disruptions. Uncertainty arises from lead time, disruption threshold assumptions, and the challenge of capturing impact magnitude, especially for rapidly intensifying TCs. These findings underscore the importance of including indirect impacts into Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF) frameworks, which could enhance decision making. This research aligns with the development of IBF and situational awareness mechanisms promoted by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Building on this, the work supports international organizations in activating early warning protocols and delivering more targeted aid, such as financial resources, blankets, medical supplies, and volunteer personnel by identifying where hospitals are likely to be disrupted and which populations may lose access to healthcare. The visualizations generated further assist decision-makers in prioritizing areas that require immediate support.",

      "description": "The relationship between sea surface temperatures (SST) and climate events in the Amazon is more complex than suggested by traditional climate models, involving the of multiple oceanic drivers and spatially and temporally heterogeneous responses across the basin. The first EOF mode in the tropical Pacific corresponds to Central El Niño events, featuring basin-wide positive SST anomalies with 2 to 8 year cycles. The second mode relates to Eastern El Niño events, showing localized positive anomalies in the Niño 1 + 2 region and opposing negative anomalies in northern and southern Pacific, with shorter 1 to 4 year oscillations. In the tropical Atlantic, the main EOF mode is the Equatorial Atlantic Mode (EAM), characterized by basin-wide negative SST anomalies on 2 to 4 year cycles. The second Atlantic mode is the Positive Atlantic Dipole, distinguished by opposing SST anomalies in the northern and southern tropics, varying between 6 months and 1 year. Correlation analyses between these climate modes and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) show that Central El Niño strongly influences Amazon droughts year-round, especially in northern and central sub-basins like Japurá, Negro, Trombetas-Uatumã, and Paru-Jari. The impact of the Eastern El Niño is milder and spatially heterogeneous, with opposite effects particularly evident in the Upper Negro sub-basin. The cold phase of the EAM favors wetter rainy seasons but can induce moisture reduction during the transition to the dry season, especially when combined with other seasonal forcings. When the Positive Atlantic Dipole occurs in the rainy season, Japurá and Negro basins become wetter, but other sub-basins face moderate drought. This oceanic pattern promotes drier conditions, bringing forward the onset of the dry season in practically all sub-basins. Our results demonstrate that Pacific and Atlantic oceanic patterns play complementary roles, with Central El Niño driving widespread and prolonged droughts, while Atlantic modes modulate the of extreme events, often amplifying or attenuating the impacts depending on the sub-basin considered. This enhanced understanding of coupled ocean–atmosphere interactions is essential for improving climate prediction, water resource management, and adaptation strategies in the face of increasing hydroclimatic extremes in the Amazon Basin.",

      "description": "Coastal areas drive much of the world's tourism growth, yet they are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the tourism sector, as environmental degradation can diminish the appeal of destinations. The tourism sector's strong dependence on women's work exposes it to gendered impacts, as climate risks in coastal environments are not gender-neutral but affect women disproportionately. Despite the growing attention to climate change in tourism research, methodological limitations have often overlooked household and community scales, thereby underutilizing women's knowledge and lived experiences. This study addresses these gaps by using photovoice, a participatory method that enables participants to frame and articulate climate-related changes in their own terms, based on their lived experiences. The participants' photovoices revealed changes in natural resources and coastal infrastructure linked to the spaces where women's work takes place and upon which it depends. A feminist political ecology lens informs the interpretation of these results, suggesting that the growing uncertainty associated with climate change has blurred the boundaries of these spaces, which form the core of women's work in tourism, reshaping their roles in ways that reinforce subordination rather than promote equal participation in the ocean economy. Moreover, the photovoices reveal that economic and non-economic losses represent interconnected dimensions of the same processes of change. The interaction between climate change and tourism thus introduces multidimensional, gender-related vulnerabilities that extend beyond economic impacts to include implications for women's political agency and a sense of cultural pride. By focusing on women's experiences, this study enhances our understanding of gendered vulnerabilities in coastal tourism and provides insights for developing more inclusive practices that promote gender equity and diversity in marine environments.",

      "description": "Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face accelerating climate hazards that undermine agricultural productivity. Fiji’s sugarcane sector, which is central to rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings, is increasingly affected by floods, droughts, cyclones, irregular rainfall, and rising input costs. Assessing farm-level climate vulnerability is essential for guiding effective adaptation. A convergent mixed-methods design was applied, integrating surveys from 100 smallholder farmers, panel regression to estimate hazard-specific yield elasticities, and AI-assisted scenario modeling aligned with Asian Development Bank climate projections. Stratified sampling captured variation in farm size, location, and cooperative membership, and survey responses were cross-validated with production records to ensure reliability. Flood-related hazards showed the strongest negative association with multi-year yields (β = −0.49, p < 0.001), followed by irregular rainfall and drought effects. Flood impacts were most severe because water-logging, access disruption, and delayed harvesting weakened ratoons and reduced subsequent cycle yields. Socio-institutional constraints, including limited cooperative support, inadequate extension services, and low youth engagement, intensified vulnerability. Grassroots participation, modeled on South Korea’s Saemaul Undong, can strengthen local coordination and adoption of adaptive practices. AI-assisted scenarios provided validated projections and identified priority adaptation pathways. The findings indicate a hydrology-first risk profile in Fiji’s coastal sugarcane systems. Targeted water management and accelerated varietal upgrading are essential to sustaining productivity under increasing climatic extremes. Coordinated investments in drainage, stress-tolerant cultivars, and farmer–extension partnerships can narrow adaptation gaps and stabilize rural livelihoods. Although focused on Fiji, the analysis provides a transferable framework for estimating climate-induced yield elasticities and validating adaptation strategies in coastal smallholder cane systems across tropical Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The integrated empirical and AI-based methodology offers a replicable template for climate resilience assessment in tropical agriculture.",

Analytical methods included keyword co-occurrence mapping and cluster analysis using CiteSpace and VOSviewer.ResultsThe analysis revealed a steady increase in publication output, accompanied by a notable shift from single-disease studies to complex system assessments. Research patterns showed distinct thematic priorities: vector-borne diseases demonstrated significant growth after 2018; respiratory infections maintained consistent research attention, while enteric diseases received comparatively limited focus. These patterns reflect underlying socioeconomic disparities and regional climatic influences.ConclusionThis study underscores the need for more systematic research on the intersection of climate change and infectious diseases. Future work should develop multi-disease analytical frameworks, advance interdisciplinary methods integrating environmental and data sciences with public health, and strengthen global research networks by improving geographic coverage and data standardization. These efforts will enhance predictive capabilities and intervention strategies against climate-sensitive infectious diseases.",

      "description": "IntroductionClimate assemblies have gained attention as participatory governance instruments designed to address complex climate challenges through inclusive deliberation. However, despite their growing prominence, systematic approaches for assessing their performance and impact remain scarce. This study responds to that gap by proposing a structured evaluation framework to measure the deliberative effectiveness of climate assemblies within the broader context of democratic climate governance.MethodsAn iterative, multi-stakeholder design process guided the development of the framework. It drew upon best-practice reviews, stakeholder consultations, and collaborative workshops. The resulting structure integrates input, process, and outcome dimensions, each associated with two key objectives: policy legitimacy, rooted in inclusive and trusted participation, and policy effectiveness, reflected in the influence of assembly recommendations on climate policy. The framework was piloted in two European climate assemblies to test its applicability and robustness.ResultsThe pilot evaluations demonstrated that applying a systematic assessment framework enhanced transparency and accountability within deliberative processes. It enabled a clearer understanding of how well assemblies fulfilled their aims of inclusion, deliberative quality, and policy relevance. Findings also revealed that consistent evaluation helps identify design strengths and weaknesses, supporting more evidence-based improvements in future assemblies.DiscussionThe study shows that structured evaluation is not merely a reporting exercise but a mechanism to strengthen democratic legitimacy and practical effectiveness. By offering standardized criteria and measurable indicators, the framework assists policymakers, organizers, and researchers in assessing whether climate assemblies translate citizen participation into tangible climate action. It contributes a practical and theoretically grounded tool for advancing deliberative democratic practices in climate governance.",

      "description": "With climate change, human exposure to heat has increased over recent decades and is expected to substantially increase in the future. This study introduces a novel metric – namely, the exponentially weighted degree-day approach – to assess population-weighted heat exposure at the national level, incorporating both static and dynamic population scenarios. Using ERA5 reanalysis and CMIP6 climate projections under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, we analyze and categorize global heat exposure and its trends from 1960 until 2100. Our findings reveal a significant rise in heat exposure over past decades, disentangling the contributions of climate and demographic changes. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of biases across different datasets and model dimensions provides a global perspective based on daily maximum and daily mean temperatures. This analysis forms the basis for quantifying current and future heat exposure, together with a qualitative heat zone classification scheme. The results underscore the urgent need for targeted adaptation strategies and improved climate metrics to better assess and mitigate future heat-related risks.",

      "description": "ClimaMeter is a real-time platform designed to provide rapid, science-based assessments of extreme weather events and their links to climate change. ClimaMeter’s methodology relies on identifying large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and comparing them to historical data, analyzing how the intensity of extreme weather events have changed because of anthropogenic climate change or natural climate variability. By leveraging historical climate data, machine learning, and real-time weather observations, ClimaMeter delivers near-instantaneous attribution results, enabling informed decision-making in a time when media cycles and public attention are brief. This speed is crucial for climate action, as it helps policymakers, emergency responders, and the public understand the role of climate change in specific extreme events and take timely, effective measures. This allows for quicker, data-driven responses to disasters, such as the October 2024 Valencia floods or the Medicane Daniel, by informing disaster response, infrastructure planning, and resilience-building efforts. ClimaMeter also plays a key role in countering climate change misinformation, offering evidence-based explanations to the public and media. By bridging the gap between scientific research and policy applications, ClimaMeter supports climate action, promotes public awareness, and aids in the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to address the growing risks posed by climate change.",

      "description": "Due to the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing, the Mediterranean has been labeled a “climate change hot spot.” Previous studies have shown that climate change has dire consequences on socioeconomic situations in the Mediterranean region. Ten high-resolution global coupled climate models and two climate emissions scenarios are analyzed from the Bias Correction Constructed Analogs with Quantile mapping reordering dataset, which is downscaled CMIP6 data. Daily precipitation and air-temperature data from both the wet and dry season is used to calculate droughts and heatwaves in the Mediterranean region, including the Middle East and North Africa countries. As expected, larger impacts are observed in the high emissions scenario and during the dry season for both droughts and heatwaves. Comparing the wet season to the dry season droughts, there is a northward shift in the positive signal as most of the values are seen over the Mediterranean Sea in the wet season and over the northern Mediterranean and Europe in the dry season. For the heatwaves, the dry season shows a response stronger than the one observed by the wet season by nearly two times, and there is a strong signal located over the Mediterranean Sea during the dry season that is not seen during the wet season.",

Sixty-eight studies (2000–2024) met inclusion criteria, assessing agroforestry impacts under climate-related stressors. Data extraction followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on 68 effect sizes categorized into pest/disease incidence, yield loss and quality degradation. Heterogeneity, bias and publication quality were assessed using ROBINS-I and GRADE-CERQual criteria.ResultsAgroforestry interventions reduced climate-related yield loss (OR = 0.67 [0.56–0.80], I2 = 0%), pest and disease incidence (OR = 0.79 [0.67–0.95], I2 = 0%) and quality degradation (OR = 0.74 [0.63–0.86], I2 = 0%). The homogeneity across subgroups suggests consistent benefits across agroecological zones.

Based on a panel dataset covering Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi from 2000 to 2024, we apply climate anomaly analysis, correlation assessment, and performance indexing to explore the links between climate shocks, infrastructure vulnerability, and development outcomes. The results show that rural electricity systems are consistently more sensitive to climate fluctuations than urban ones, with vulnerability indices ranging from 0.234 in Kenya to 1.234 in Burundi. Rather than narrowing, rural–urban electricity gaps widened in most countries, most notably by 23.5 percent in Tanzania and 14 percent in Burundi, while Kenya made substantial progress, reducing its gap by 15.2 percent. Countries with larger electricity access gaps also showed stronger negative correlations between climate variability and agricultural output, including −0.678 in Burundi, highlighting the importance of reliable electricity in reducing climate impacts. In contrast, Kenya’s near-zero correlation suggests that improved electricity access can help buffer agricultural systems from climate stress. These findings highlight a growing adaptation gap, where rural communities, despite facing greater exposure to climate risks, are often the least equipped to respond due to limited access to reliable electricity and enabling infrastructure. The study underscores the need to treat electricity access not only as a development priority but as a vital form of climate adaptation, and calls for spatially targeted, climate-resilient infrastructure strategies to promote equitable and sustainable rural transformation.",

      "description": "Arctic amplification caused by global warming is accelerating an unprecedented loss of Arctic sea ice due to thinning of multi-year sea ice and increased export through Fram Strait, which is the largest Arctic gateway for ice export. The transition to a thinner and younger Arctic ice cover has resulted in a steady surface albedo decline of 1.25–1.51% per decade, weakening the radiative cooling effect of sea ice by 0.04–0.05 W m–2 per decade. The Fram Strait ice export (FSIE) is a major sink in the Arctic ice mass balance, accounting for approximately 14% of the annual sea ice volume loss. As the ice becomes thinner, it drifts faster, leading to enhanced ice export. The annual and summer FSIE have increased by about 6% and 11% per decade, respectively, further accelerating Arctic sea ice decline. Surface Albedo Modification (SAM) has been considered among variety of climate intervention solutions to slow down the transition of the Arctic into a seasonally ice-free ocean by mid-century, in concert with the greenhouse emissions mitigation efforts. Using climate model simulations, we evaluate the impacts of SAM application on the Arctic radiation budget and ice cover in two deployment scenarios: Arctic-wide and regional in Fram Strait. We model such an increase in sea ice albedo as a perturbation to the present-day climate state. Our results show that enhancing the surface albedo by up to 20% Arctic-wide during summer reduces the absorbed radiation at the surface by 11.16 W/m2 and increases outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere by 10.70 W/m2. This results in surface cooling of –1.33°C and recovers approximately 10% of the present-day Arctic sea ice radiative cooling power. These findings suggest that large-scale surface albedo modification could offset Arctic warming and contribute measurably to global cooling. The regional targeted deployment in Fram Strait yields more spatially limited but dynamically significant responses. SAM in Fram Strait enhances surface albedo both locally and in adjacent regions (Barents, Kara Sea) through advection of thicker, more reflective ice. The resulting radiative cooling alters atmospheric circulation, strengthening the low-pressure system over the Barents–Kara sector and triggering a negative Arctic Dipole pattern. This reduces sea-ice export by 2.4% through Fram Strait via weakening the Transpolar Drift in addition to the local thickening and slowing of the ice in the FS region, supporting ice retention within the Arctic basin. Furthermore, the modified atmospheric circulation induces dynamically driven nonlocal ice growth in areas of Central Arctic which persist year-round. These results highlight the potential of Fram Strait albedo enhancement to support multi-year ice recovery and reduce its loss via the Fram Strait. While basin-wide SAM offers the greatest potential benefits, it remains logistically challenging and carries higher risks of unintended consequences. Targeted regional interventions—such as in the Fram Strait and marginal seas (Barents, Kara, and Beaufort)—present a more feasible and cost-effective alternative, with lower risks and the potential to induce basin-wide responses through coupled atmosphere–ice–ocean interactions. These regions are dynamically linked to major circulation centers, including the Barents–Kara Low and Beaufort High, making them promising leverage points for intervention. A strategy for Arctic climate intervention, where a coordinated, regionally targeted, and seasonally adaptive deployment—combining summer albedo enhancement with winter ice thickening—may offer the greatest potential to stabilize Arctic sea ice while minimizing risks.",

Here we (1) compare performance a variety of commercially available sensors in a blind mesocosm experiment simulating ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), and how sensor performance impacted carbonate chemistry estimates; (2) evaluate if sensors can distinguish the OAE signal from natural variability during a small scale OAE field test in Sequim Bay, WA, USA, and (3) use an idealized ocean biogeochemistry model to explore optimal sensor network design based on (1) and (2). Our mesocosm results indicate that correctly constraining pH uncertainty will be critical for accurate TA estimates with current sensor technology compared to the less impactful variation caused by uncertainty in pCO2 (pH data that are presented throughout are reported on the total scale (pHT) unless otherwise noted). Our pilot field test demonstrated that sensors were capable of distinguishing mCDR signatures from natural variability under optimal real-world conditions. Idealized modeling simulations of the field test showed that a range of sparse and dense (3 to 100) sensors sampling areas of detectable increases will underestimate the net change in surface pH by at least 35–55%, at both realistic and highly elevated alkalinity input levels. We also highlight the limitations of current sensing technology for MRV, and the importance of ocean biogeochemistry models as critical tools for predicting when and where mCDR signals will be detectable using available sensors. Overall, our findings suggest that commercially available pCO2 sensors and some pH sensors will form an important backbone for mCDR MRV tasks, though complete MRV characterization will require these data to be used in combination with other tools.",

      "description": "Mineral carbonation in reactive bedrock offers a rapid and permanent method for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, converting CO2 into stable mineral phases within a geologically short timeframe. This study presents the first-ever systematic assessment of onshore CO2 mineral storage potential in Sweden, based on fieldwork, sampling, and mineralogical and geochemical analyses conducted at 23 localities. While this theoretical assessment cannot resolve uncertainties related to reactivity, dissolution capacity, and sequestration efficiency, it provides a critical foundation for identifying potentially favorable storage reservoirs. The findings highlight the Örnsköldsvik and Sundsvall areas in central Sweden, hosting a gabbro-anorthosite complex together with a set of dolerites, as the more suitable lithologies for onshore CO2 storage. These rocks are distinguished by their high content of reactive minerals—including olivine, Ca-rich plagioclase, and clinopyroxene—and low content of alteration phases. In the few locations where secondary phases such as serpentine and chlorite were observed, they were confined to grain boundaries and microfractures and did not appear to be pervasive throughout the rock. This preservation of primary mineralogy and textures supports the interpretation that these two lithologies are among the most suitable for CO2 mineral storage within the studied rock formations, under geochemical and thermal conditions favorable for mineral carbonation. This work provides the necessary foundation for future and ongoing experimental validation of reactivity and permeability and detailed site-specific investigations.",

      "description": "Feed shortages during the dry season remain a critical challenge for livestock production in Southern Africa, where ruminant farming supports livelihoods and food security. This review assesses the role of indigenous multipurpose trees (MPTs) in enhancing ruminant livestock production during the dry season and climate change adaptation. Using PRISMA 2020 guidelines, the review systematically analyzed 41 ethnobotanical studies and 19 in vivo trials, identifying key gaps in prior reviews regarding quantitative ethnobotanical metrics, regional coverage, and climate adaptation mechanisms. The review identified 122 plant species from 34 botanical families and 78 genera browsed by ruminants, with Dichrostachys cinerea and Colophospermum mopane emerging as the most frequently cited species. These MPTs provide essential ecosystem services, including medicine, food, construction materials, firewood, and ethnoveterinary uses, while also contributing to climate resilience through shade, windbreaks, and insect repellent properties. The findings demonstrate that integrating these trees into livestock diets improves body weight, milk and meat production, and reduces methane emissions. Despite their potential, invasive species like D. cinerea require careful management. We recommend adopting non-invasive, high-value species such as Acacia erioloba, Sclerocarya birrea, Boscia albitrunca, and C. mopane into silvopastoral systems to mitigate feed shortages and enhance climate resilience. Future efforts should focus on domestication, conservation, and policy support to optimize their use in sustainable livestock production.",

      "description": "This study examines the impact of oil price shocks on the stock performance of 73 listed banks—41 conventional and 32 Islamic—across dual banking systems in net oil-exporting and importing countries. Employing panel fixed-effects and two-stage least squares (2SLS) IV regressions, we address both endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity. The results indicate that oil price fluctuations have a significant impact on bank stock returns, with a stronger negative effect during oil price declines, particularly those driven by demand-side shocks. Islamic banks are more sensitive to these fluctuations than their conventional counterparts, reflecting greater exposure to oil-dependent macroeconomic environments. Robustness checks confirm the presence of non-linear and asymmetric effects: bank stock returns respond more adversely to falling oil prices than to increases in oil prices. These responses differ systematically across bank types and levels of national oil dependency. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for oil price risk in bank valuation and performance forecasting. For financial managers and investors, the results underscore the importance of incorporating oil-related risk factors into portfolio management, stress testing, and pricing models. For regulators and policymakers, the evidence supports the adoption of macroprudential tools such as countercyclical capital buffers and sector-specific supervisory frameworks to strengthen banking system resilience, particularly for Islamic banks operating in oil-dependent economies. Additionally, disclosure standards should be enhanced to improve transparency around oil price exposure, enabling better-informed decision-making across all stakeholder-dependent economies.",

      "description": "This paper proposes to bridge the gap between traditional criminal law and environmental jurisprudence by redefining the harm principle proposed by Mill through the Environmental Harm and Human Risk Matrix. The Matrix classifies environmental harm and human risk as low, medium, and high impact, creating nine intersectional approaches to assess environmental harm based on its severity and irreversibility, the risk to human and non-human wellbeing, its intergenerational impact, and the ability to mitigate the impact. Through the Matrix, the paper identifies activities that should be assessed as violations with no criminal liability, harms that should have criminal liability and harms that are subject to interpretation by the executive and the judiciary thereby helping to understand environmental harm within the socioeconomic realities of the situation. The approach not only challenges anthropocentric legal paradigms but also the interpretation of the harm principle while treating the environment as a resource. The challenge to the anthropocentric legal paradigms integrates the socioeconomic realities, environmental harm to human and non-human beings and offers guidelines to differentiate violations requiring restorative approaches from crimes necessitating punitive action. The paper further argues that if environmental harm is purely perceived from the lens of the harm principle apportioning blameworthiness based on liability, culpability and accountability, then the entire human population commits environmental harm since the environment is a resource which is used/misused by all. The paper integrates both approaches while contextualizing the use/misuse of the environment as a resource and examines liability and culpability from the profit motive, wherein environmental harm is intergenerational, pervasive, long-term, and irreversible. However, social manifestations (order, disorder and strain in the society), behavior, culture and socioeconomic vulnerabilities on the utilization of the environment as a resource are imperative to understand environmental harm before affixing accountability. The paper develops a theoretical framework examining the relevant legal and criminological theories (deterrence, rational choice, etc.) and proposes a differential approach to assess environmental harm committed for profits and those committed by the marginalized and least advantaged members of society who invariably utilize environmental resources for survival and/or out of necessity. The paper further argues that sweeping punitive actions risk creating a ‘paradox of poverty’. The Matrix contributes to the current scholarship from the legal and sociological standpoint, arguing for a just, fair and equitable utilization of resources while ensuring an inclusive and sustainable policy to combat environmental violations and thus harm. The work contributes to global green criminology discourse urging transformative legal reforms to mitigate ecological violence and advance planetary justice.",
