      "description": "BackgroundEmerging evidence suggests that greenness may be beneficial to human health; however, the relationship between greenness exposure and childhood allergic rhinitis (AR) is inconsistent, and whether and how the link is moderated or mediated by meteorological factors and air pollutants remains unclear.MethodsWe conducted an observational study in Sanya, China. Information on AR and covariates was collected from e-questionnaires. Greenness exposure was assessed using satellite-estimated data based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Binomial generalized linear models with a log link were used to evaluate the associations between greenness exposure and childhood AR, presented as prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in greenness, adjusting for potential confounders. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were also performed.ResultsOf the 9,754 children included in the study, the prevalence of ever AR (EAR) and current AR (CAR) was 15.6 and 23.2%, respectively. An IQR increase in greenness was associated with an attenuated PR of childhood AR. The PRs (95% CIs) were 0.95 (0.88–1.02), 0.94 (0.88–1.00), 0.94 (0.89–0.99), and 0.95 (0.90–0.99) for EAR-NDVI, EAR-EVI, CAR-NDVI, and CAR-EVI, respectively. Furthermore, these associations existed only in boys [PRs (95% CIs) were 0.92 (0.85–0.99), 0.92 (0.85–0.98), and 0.93 (0.88–0.99) for EVI-EAR, NDVI-CAR, and EVI-CAR, respectively], and low-temperature groups [PRs (95% CIs) were 0.89 (0.80–0.99), 0.87 (0.78–0.97), 0.91 (0.84–0.98), and 0.92(0.85–0.99) for NDVI-EAR, EVI-EAR, NDVI-CAR, and EVI-CAR, respectively]. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were found to mediate these associations.ConclusionGreenness exposure seems to reduce the prevalence ratio of childhood AR. These associations may be more pronounced in boys and in low-temperature groups and were mediated by ambient temperature and relative humidity. These findings offer new perspectives for considering ambient temperature and relative humidity in relation to greenness exposure and children’s health.",

      "description": "Enhancing transportation total-factor carbon productivity constitutes a critical initiative for high-quality economic development across Chinese provinces. Based on panel data from 30 Chinese provinces spanning 2007–2022, this study comprehensively employs the Super-Efficiency Slack-Based Measure (SBM) model, non-parametric kernel density estimation, standard deviational ellipse, and global Moran's I index to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of Total Factor Carbon Productivity in Transportation (TFCP-T) across provinces. Finally, a spatial Durbin model is utilized to empirically investigate influencing factors. Key findings include: (1) China's provincial TFCP-T exhibits an overall fluctuating upward trend, yet reveals a distinct spatiotemporal differentiation pattern characterized by “high efficiency and intensification in the eastern region versus gradient lag in the central and western regions.” (2) Significant spatial positive correlation and club convergence effects exist in China's transportation green total factor productivity, with western provinces facing risks of low-level lock-in. (3) Economic development level, openness to foreign trade, environmental protection intensity, and industrial structure upgrading positively promote TFCP-T, while consumption level and informatization level exert significant inhibitory effects. These results provide critical policy insights for enhancing transportation carbon productivity and fostering regional coordinated development in China.",

      "description": "Entrepreneurship plays a crucial role in socio-economic development, particularly in the context of green and sustainable business practices. This study explores the factors influencing and mediating green entrepreneurial intention (GEI) in Vietnam within the Net Zero context. The research integrates the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and social cognitive theory (SCT) to develop a comprehensive research model. Primary data were collected through a face-to-face survey with 400 business students. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that nine factors directly influence GEI, namely, self-efficacy (SE), attitude toward entrepreneurship, SN, perceived behavioral control, green industry awareness, entrepreneurship education, social persuasion, capital sources, and personality traits. In addition, the study highlights the mediating role of SE in linking the variables of TPB and SCT to GEI. The findings provide practical recommendations for policymakers and educational institutions to promote green entrepreneurship through targeted education, financial support, and enhanced social networks.",

      "description": "This study investigates the preferences of rainfed farmers in West Africa for bundled agroclimate services, addressing challenges posed by climate variability and limited purchasing power. With various startups offering digital communication channels, credit, and insurance services, farmers often struggle to afford individual services, necessitating coherent service packages. The research aims to identify the most preferred attributes of agroclimate services and predict how increasing climate variability affects farmers' choices. Using a Choice Experiment and Mixed Logit model, data was collected from 1,212 farmers across four West African countries (Ghana, Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso). The findings reveal that the most preferred service bundle (Bundle 4), which includes daily weather forecasts, seed advisories, and drought insurance, garnered a preference of 45%. In contrast, Bundle 0, which lacks these features, was selected by only 22% of farmers. Notably, the introduction of a USD 1,000 credit option increased the likelihood of selecting preferred bundles by 39%. Additionally, 62% of farmers indicated that weather-based information is a critical factor in their decision-making. Access to agricultural credit significantly influenced choices, with a 17% increase in the likelihood of selecting preferred bundles when credit was available. The study underscores the importance of designing comprehensive service packages that cater to farmers' specific and urgent needs. It highlights the necessity for partnerships among service providers to improve the delivery of these essential services. By showing the agroclimate service bundling power, the study provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to support agricultural development and sustainability in West Africa.",

      "description": "IntroductionClimate predictability across timescales in a changing climate presents a unique opportunity and challenges for state-of-the-art climate models. The use of regional climate models (RCMs) forced with interactively coupled Earth System Models (ESMs) for the sub-seasonal, seasonal, and decadal predictions is an actively growing research area.MethodsThe study explores a stretched-grid RCM constrained with an ESM which integrates a climate change signature. Spectral relaxation paradigm is applied to limit the climate drift within the range of the multi-model sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice concentration (SIC) variability. The model retroactive ensemble simulations for November initialization are evaluated on the seasonal migration of the ITCZ during El-Niño and La-Niña phases, exploring both the spatial and zonal positions. The model is also evaluated on the ITCZ process’ characteristics that include the Hadley cell (HC), stream function and the subtropical jet stream (STJ) using quantitative methods.ResultsThe RCM and the driving ESM demonstrate skillful performance in identifying the seasonal trajectory of both the spatial and zonal migration of the ITCZ during El-Niño and La-Niña. Moreover, the RCM also demonstrates a good skill in determining both the descending edge of the HC and the STJ with the highest mean percentage error of 16.3 and 7.5% for the HC and STJ latitudes, respectively.ConclusionsThe November initialization of the RCM skillfully simulates the seasonal migration of the ITCZ (and related characteristics) aligned to the observations and reanalysis datasets. Notwithstanding, the RCM manifests a tendency of more dynamic error growth relative to its driving ESM as the lead time increases. Furthermore, the RCM is also out of phase with a southerly shift of the stream function compared to the 500 hPa reanalysis stream function. The modeling framework offers process oriented and teleconnection studies. It also provides great potential for climate applications with suitable bias corrections techniques, albeit the source and mechanism of its dynamic error growth deserve further investigation.",

      "description": "Scaling up enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will require gigatonnes of suitable rock, which could include mine wastes such as the estimated 3.9 Gt of kimberlite residues from historic diamond mining. Here, we conducted meter-scale field experiments (2021–2023) in Ontario, Canada, to assess fine processed kimberlite residues for ERW and test carbon-based methods for CO2 removal (CDR) quantification, including CO2 fluxes, and measurements of soil and porewater inorganic carbon. A control plot consisted of local calcareous (16.1 wt.% calcite) Brunisolic soil to assess background weathering rates. Two soil plots were amended with 20 and 40 kg of kimberlite residues from the Gahcho Kué Diamond Mine (Northwest Territories, Canada) that contained 30.2 wt.% lizardite [Mg3Si2O5(OH)4], 9.4 wt.% forsterite (Mg2SiO4), and 1.9 wt.% calcite (CaCO3). Coinciding with increases in Mg and Si, dissolved inorganic carbon increased in porewaters with kimberlite dosage (amended: 64–118 mg C/L, control: 56 ± 14 mg C/L), demonstrating CO2 solubility trapping. Water chemistry data, coupled with a water budget derived from weather and soil moisture data, were used to determine CDR rates. The removal rates by the kimberlite residues were up to 1.4 t CO2/ha over 3 years calculated using porewater inorganic carbon loadings, with Ca and Si loadings allowing for partitioning of rates into removal contributions by kimberlite-derived carbonate weathering (~75%) and silicate weathering (~25%), respectively. CO2 fluxes and soil inorganic carbon proved ineffective for CDR quantification, given the high effluxes due to soil respiration and high and variable carbonate content of the soils, respectively. Stable carbon isotope data demonstrated that the removed CO2 was derived from organic carbon, suppressing soil CO2 effluxes to the atmosphere. This study has implications for repurposing environmentally safe mine wastes for ERW with the potential to reduce net CO2 emissions and storage and remediation costs in the mining industry. We highlight similarities between kimberlite residues and basalt fines, a common quarry by-product used in ERW, advocating for the use of processed rock from current and legacy mining operations for CDR. Further, our CDR monitoring approaches that effectively distinguish between silicate and carbonate weathering may be utilized in other ERW applications.",

      "description": "The discourse surrounding climate change and the adaptation solutions needed to mitigate its impacts is often framed in terms of future time horizons. However, it has become increasingly clear that impacts are occurring today, so public awareness and engagement are critical. Despite the growing recognition of the worsening climate crisis, the gap between public understanding and approval of adaptation strategies remains a significant obstacle to community resilience in many locations. One country where broad-based public support for climate adaptation is emerging is Sweden, and one region within Sweden that is acutely experiencing the immediate impacts of climate change is Skåne. This perspective highlights a critical opportunity for decision-makers in southern Sweden to capitalize on public support to implement adaptation solutions now. While doing so, we argue that while climate adaptation may look different elsewhere, the combination of historical vulnerabilities, climate threats, public support, and governance structures is universal. Thus, the lessons learned in southern Sweden are generalizable to other similar contexts.",

      "description": "High temperatures, leading to overheating, impact the welfare of prisoners, staff and visitors in prisons in England and Wales. Quantifying current and future overheating risk can inform adaptation decision making and prioritisation of investment. In this study, a set of measurements of temperatures inside and outside six prisons, a magistrates court and an approved premises were used to establish a simple relationship between indoor and outdoor temperatures. This relationship is combined with an ensemble of climate projections and an open-source risk assessment framework, CLIMADA, to estimate the change in risk of indoor overheating. This framework supports a spatially consistent assessment of risk, enabling risk to be compared between sites. The expected number of days each prison cell or non-cell overheats is assessed for the recent past and global warming levels of 2°C and 4°C above the preindustrial era. The results indicate a large increase in risk of overheating in cells in the prisons and magistrates court, especially under 4°C of warming. The highest increases are seen in older prisons, where overheating could occur between 100 and 120 days per year if the climate warms to 4°C above pre-industrial. The overheating risk in other areas within the prisons is much smaller but still increases under a warming climate. These results show that retrofitting solutions will increasingly be needed to minimise overheating of the existing prison stock as our climate continues to warm, and that consideration of overheating needs to be incorporated into the design of new prisons.",

      "description": "Climate change hazards pose significant risks to vulnerable populations, particularly refugees residing in camps within environmentally sensitive areas. This study assesses climate and disaster risks in refugee-hosting districts in Rwanda using GIS-based risk mapping, decision science tools (AHP), remote sensing, and econometric analysis. The findings reveal spatial variability in hazard exposure across camps, with Mahama and Mugombwa refugee camps experiencing the highest flood risks, while Gihembe, Kiziba, and Kigeme camps are most susceptible to landslides. Between 2013 and 2021, landslides resulted in the damage of 324 hectares of cropland in Gihembe district and caused 110 fatalities in Kiziba’s district in 2016 alone. The study also finds that Mahama camp is highly vulnerable to drought, reflecting national data indicating that 4.2 million Rwandans were affected by droughts between 1974 and 2018. In addition, Kiziba camp exhibits severe soil erosion, with up to 19 million tons of annual soil loss in its watershed area. This erosion, exacerbated by deforestation due to firewood harvesting and construction material collection, weakens slope stability, intensifying landslide risks and increasing sediment transport into local water sources, thereby impacting water quality. Our results support recent disaster management decisions by the Government of Rwanda and UNHCR, including the closure of Gihembe camp in 2021 due to landslide risks and the relocation of vulnerable populations from Kigeme camp due to erosion-induced ravine formation. While these interventions reduce immediate risks, continued efforts are needed to enhance camp resilience, strengthen early warning systems, and integrate nature-based solutions into long-term disaster risk management.",

      "description": "Efforts are needed to better identify and measure both communities’ exposure to climate hazards and the social vulnerabilities that interact with these hazards, but the science of validating climate risk indicators is still in its infancy. Progress is needed to improve: (1) the selection of variables that are used as proxies to represent hazard exposure and vulnerability; (2) the applicability and scale for which these indicators are intended, including their suitability for transnational comparisons. We draw on an international urban survey in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Johannesburg, South Africa; London, United Kingdom; New York City, United States; and Seoul, South Korea that collected data on: exposure to various types of extreme weather events, socioeconomic characteristics commonly used as proxies for vulnerability (i.e., income, education level, gender, and age), and additional characteristics not often included in existing composite indices (i.e., Queer identity, disability identity, non-dominant primary language, and self-perceptions of both discrimination and vulnerability to climate hazard risk). We use feature importance analysis with gradient-boosted decision trees to measure the importance that these variables have in predicting exposure to various types of extreme weather events. Our results show that non-traditional variables were more relevant to self-reported exposure to extreme weather events than traditionally employed variables such as income or age. Furthermore, differences in variable relevance across different types of hazards and across urban contexts suggest that vulnerability indicators need to be fit to context and should not be used in a one-size-fits-all fashion.",

      "description": "Climate change is expected to significantly reshape the geographic distribution of many species worldwide. The bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), a species of ecological, economic, and cultural importance in Mexico, is particularly vulnerable to these environmental shifts. This study applies ecological niche modeling to estimate the probability of species occurrence based on bioclimatic variables under future climate scenarios. Using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and six General Circulation Models, projections are made for the period 2041–2060. This analysis is based on 280 georeferenced records of bighorn sheep occurrences and evaluates changes in temperature and precipitation, which are assumed to influence their potential distribution. Projections suggest a significant reduction in geographic distribution, with drier periods and extreme temperatures exerting the most detrimental effects. These findings pose considerable challenges for long-term conservation and management of bighorn sheep populations, as current strategies may be insufficient. The ecological niche model suggests focusing conservation efforts on Northern Baja California (Californian ecoregion) to identify potential distribution. This research emphasizes the critical need to integrate climate projections into conservation strategies to better manage the uncertainties of climate change.",

The material associated to four fieldworks conducted in the Republic of Sakha has been mobilized: the first one in obtained Tiksi in November 2014, the second and third one in the city of Yakutsk in September 2015, and June 2018 respectively, and the fourth one in Tiksi and Bykovsky in July 2019. The qualitative analysis of the interviews revealed that food-centered SSNs are a salient topic in local narratives. They shape the current regional socio-economic configuration and play a key role in identity processes. They allow residents from different parts of the Republic of Sakha to have access to traditional food, but also enhance residents’ feeling of safety and wellbeing. Interviewees identified multiple manifestations of changes in climate and permafrost that are currently exerting increasing pressure on SSNs. These increase the difficulties to practice traditional activities and therefore to access black food (meat and fish) which is the base of the Yakutian diet. Local narratives demonstrate that the impacts of such changes on SSNs can exceed the merely local sphere and can entail severe and long-lasting consequences at a regional scale too. Furthermore, we identify shared representations of an ideal past—that of the Soviet Union—as an immaterial source of resilience through its potential to foster collective action.",

      "description": "Co-benefits conceptually apply broadly to the realms of sustainability and resilience and are increasingly relevant in decision-making processes as there is an increase in complex and compound events. Therefore, infrastructure design, planning, governance, and disaster preparedness for compound events are critical for building resilient systems. Decisions are often based on direct benefits of a proposed project or intervention, which are the more salient to decision makers and may be the function of available financing and experience with event types. The ideal community resilience actions for a community may be heavily influenced by the identification (and inclusion) of co-benefits in assessments of community resilience alternatives. Fung and Helgeson reviewed the literature on co-benefits with a specific focus on the definition of co-benefits, areas where co-benefits are used the most (considering the literature related to climate change), and co-benefit measurement and assessment methodologies in the context of resilience planning. The current study further explores these areas by focusing on the development of the literature on co-benefits published since 2017. The specific review questions explored are: (1) What is the major focus of the literature on co-benefits? and (2) What are methods and tools for measurement and assessment of co-benefits? The literature review reveals two primary focus areas: co-benefits of resilience and sustainability planning, and co-benefits of climate mitigation and adaptation actions. The latter are further categorized as falling as either health co-benefits or environmental and social co-benefits of climate actions. Within the two broad focus areas, our study reviews research objectives, analysis region, co-benefit categories, direct benefits, and evaluation methods and assessment frameworks. Moreover, we provide a synthesis of analysis tools and assessment methods including monetization methods, multi-criteria (i.e., multi-objective) analysis methods, scoring methods and matrices, and systematic reviews. The review reveals several gaps and opportunities for both future research and applications. One opportunity is to develop more generic evaluation methods for co-benefits with a focus on scoring methods and matrices, which provide a good balance of quantitative and qualitative evaluation, in the development of more generic analysis and assessment methods and tools.",

      "description": "The effects of climate change events such as wildfires, storms, flooding, and pest outbreaks remain a constant threat to the health of Canadian forests. Consequently, adaptation and mitigation actions are necessary to reduce the effects and impacts of climate change and prevent further deterioration of forest health. Using a climate change toolkit is a common way for forest practitioners to understand their climate risks, develop locally relevant adaptation and mitigation options, and drive the implementation of strategies to improve forest resilience. In this review paper, we examine how climate change adaptation and mitigation toolkits have been developed in the Canadian forest sector, the challenges that were encountered, and if and how Indigenous and local knowledge were incorporated into the process. Our results show that toolkits developed holistically and comprehensively provide a good foundation for implementing long-term impactful climate action. Achieving this requires a broad understanding and mapping of climate issues, implementation options, as well as best practices for monitoring and evaluation of action plans. If developed appropriately, toolkits can provide flexible pathways that are tailored to local changing climatic patterns, events, and impacts within specific contexts or sectors, ultimately improving forest resilience in the face of climate change.",

The results showed that the hidden variables of educational and economic, technical and economic, and cultural and economic dimensions have a significant relationship with each other. Variables such as financial support from official institutions to greenhouse owners for the preparation and installation of new irrigation systems, financial facilities provided by Agriculture Bank for greenhouse development, financial support for research and development in optimal water management, and financial support packages for adopters of smart technologies impact the economic dimension of water consumption management among greenhouse owners. Additionally, the ability to attract support from local leaders for optimal water management, capacity building, and the empowerment of local communities—particularly youth—in this area, as well as the formation of cooperative groups among users of new irrigation methods, facilitate interactions between greenhouse owners.",

      "description": "Coffee farming supports the livelihoods of over 15 million people in Ethiopia. However, approximately 90% of Ethiopian coffee producers are smallholders, making them among the most vulnerable to global change because of their limited resources and high dependence on family labor. This study examined the vulnerability of coffee-based farmers to climate change and variability across five districts in the West Wolega Zone of Western Ethiopia. The study combined primary and secondary data. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect primary data from 642 household heads, using 35 vulnerability indicators. Secondary data was obtained from the Ethiopian Meteorological Institute (EMI). The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC) framework were used for data analysis. The LVI indicated that coffee producers in Gimbi district (0.387) were more vulnerable to climate change and variability, followed by those in Homa (0.379), Ganji (0.377), Nolekaba (0.370), and Haru district (0.365). The LVI-IPCC analysis showed that coffee farming communities in the Haru districts (0.097) were the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by the Nolekaba (0.089), Homa (0.082), Ganji (0.081), and Gimbi districts (0.077). Spatial disparity in vulnerability is explained by the heterogeneity of socioeconomic and biophysical factors. Food, water, and climate variability contributed to the high vulnerability of farming households in all districts. Overall, farmers in all districts face the highest exposure and sensitivity, combined with a limited adaptive capacity. The findings of this study are crucial for stakeholders and policymakers as they provide essential insights for designing and implementing strategies to reduce vulnerability and improve the adaptability of coffee farming households.",

      "description": "IntroductionAgro-meteorological services are crucial for mitigating climate variability’s impact on agriculture and enhancing food security. Despite their importance, the global research landscape in this field remains underexplored. This study examines the evolution of agro meteorological research from 2010 to 2024, focusing on trends, contributors, and regional developments.MethodsA bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Dimensions database, with visualizations created via VOSviewer. The study analyzed publication trends, key institutions, authors, journals, and subject clusters. Statistical correlations assessed collaboration and institutional impact.ResultsThe results revealed that publications increased steadily, peaking in 2020 (r = 0.92, p < 0.01), reflecting emphasis on sustainability and climate adaptation. Collaborative publications correlated strongly with institutional impact (r = 0.75, p < 0.01), led by Wageningen University and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Sustainability and The Science of the Total Environment were key journals. Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia showed significant research growth (r = 0.85, p < 0.01).DiscussionThe results highlight the field’s global, interdisciplinary scope and rising contributions from developing regions. However, capacity gaps and limited integration of indigenous knowledge persist. Inclusive partnerships and capacity building are essential to strengthen agro meteorological services and address climate challenges effectively.",

      "description": "IntroductionRoad traffic fatalities (RTFs) in low-resource settings like Somalia are influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic, environmental, and political challenges. This study investigates the impact of climate change (temperature, rainfall), environmental degradation (CO2 emissions), socioeconomic conditions (urban population, foreign aid), and political instability on RTFs in Somalia, aiming to contribute to the limited understanding of these dynamics in fragile states.MethodsA multivariate time series analysis was conducted using data from 1984 to 2021. An Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model was employed to examine the short-run and long-run effects of the selected drivers on RTFs. The robustness of the model was confirmed through a series of diagnostic tests.ResultsThe ARDL model revealed significant long-run relationships: increased urbanization, CO2 emissions, and political instability were associated with higher RTFs. Conversely, increased rainfall and foreign aid were associated with lower RTFs in the long run. In the short-run, nuanced effects were observed, with both increased temperature and rainfall exhibiting positive associations with RTFs, suggesting immediate, potentially transitory, impacts.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings challenge simplistic explanations of RTF drivers and highlight the necessity of integrated road safety strategies. Such strategies should address climate change adaptation, environmental protection, socioeconomic development, and the promotion of good governance. This research provides valuable insights for evidence-based policymaking aimed at reducing RTFs and achieving Sustainable Development Goals related to health, infrastructure, and sustainable communities in Somalia and similar contexts.",
