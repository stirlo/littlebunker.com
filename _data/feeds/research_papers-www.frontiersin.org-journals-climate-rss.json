      "description": "Hydrological models are essential tools for water resource management and for mitigating extreme hydrological events risks. Although they are crucial for flood forecasting, these models often exhibit substantial uncertainties, including input data uncertainties (e.g., precipitation) and structural uncertainties of the models themselves. This study aims to explore the implications of different precipitation datasets and hydrological model structures on streamflow simulation, by evaluating the effects of multiple precipitation products and employing an enhanced model version to reduce structural uncertainty. This study evaluated the hydrological applicability of three representative precipitation products—reanalysis-based (the land component of the fifth-generation European Reanalysis, ERA5-Land), satellite-based (Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM, IMERG), and machine learning-based (the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale, spateGAN-ERA5), using the offline version of WRF-Hydro, a distributed hydrological model. Additionally, this study evaluated the performance of an enhanced version of WRF-Hydro, incorporating an overbank flow module for reducing the model structural uncertainty in a large, flood-prone tropical river basin, Irrawaddy River Basin in Myanmar. The findings indicate that: (1) Simulations driven by IMERG precipitation outperformed those driven by ERA5-Land and spateGAN-ERA5 in terms of accuracy in streamflow, with average NSE values of 0.77, compared to 0.19 and 0.09, respectively; (2) The modified model with enabled overbank flow showed consistent improvements over the default model. The average NSE improved from 0.09–0.77 (default) to 0.31–0.78 (modified); (3) The water balance analysis reveals that incorporating the overbank flow module reduces surface runoff, accompanied by an increase in soil moisture storage, and slightly enhancing underground runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) during the rainy period. After the end of the rainy period, the increase soil moisture storage gradually contributes to an increase in surface runoff. These results highlight the significant impact of accurate precipitation data and the overbank flow module on hydrological processes, particularly in flood-prone areas, and suggest that the modified model and high quality precipitation data may enhance hydrological forecasting capabilities.",

      "description": "China has put forward the “carbon peak and carbon neutral” climate commitment, but as the basic unit of the national economy, China’s county economy is facing the double pressure of economic growth and emission reduction. Based on panel data spanning 1677 Chinese counties from 2014 to 2022, this study employs fixed-effects, mediation, moderation, and quantile models to analyze and derive the following conclusions. (1) digital financial inclusion has a significant impact on the improvement of county carbon productivity, with an influence coefficient as high as 19.44%. (2) Digital financial inclusion enhances county-level carbon productivity by promoting technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. The positive moderating effects of traditional finance and urbanization further amplify this impact. Digital financial inclusion exerts a strong positive effect on carbon productivity at lower quantiles, but its influence diminishes at median quantiles and turns negative at higher quantiles. This pattern reflects diminishing marginal returns and tightening resource constraints as development approaches the technological frontier. (3) Only digitalization level and coverage breadth of digital financial inclusion have a significant positive impact on county carbon productivity, and the effect of digitalization level is almost twice that of coverage breadth. The influence coefficients of digital inclusive finance on carbon productivity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Yellow River Basin are 21.72% and 27.82%, respectively, which are more significant than those in other places. This paper recommends prioritizing low-carbon industrial development, shifting focus to less-developed regions to leverage latecomer advantages, and embedding carbon productivity targets into regional strategies with incentive mechanisms to drive sustainable growth.",

      "description": "This study explores the integration of Somalia’s unregulated exchange rate market with regional and global financial systems and investigates how climate-induced shocks influence currency resilience in a fragile, post-conflict context. The research utilizes time series data from 1995 to 2017 and employs advanced econometric techniques including the Johansen cointegration test, vector error correction model (VECM), Granger causality tests, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition. The model incorporates climate shock indicators to assess short-and long-run dynamics in exchange rate behavior. The results reveal significant long-term cointegration between the Somali Shilling and major regional and global currencies, suggesting deep financial integration. Short-term fluctuations are largely driven by regional currency movements. Climate shocks intensify exchange rate volatility, especially through channels such as agriculture, remittances, and trade, indicating structural vulnerabilities within the unregulated exchange system. The findings highlight the vulnerability of Somalia’s unregulated exchange market to external climate shocks, underscoring the need for formal integration of this system into national monetary frameworks. Policy actions should focus on strengthening institutional oversight, promoting transparent exchange rate mechanisms, and incorporating climate resilience strategies into monetary planning. In particular, a phased regulatory approach that aligns informal currency markets with regional and global financial systems could help stabilize exchange rate volatility and improve the country’s macroeconomic resilience. This is one of the first empirical studies to analyze the intersection of climate shocks and unregulated exchange rate systems in a post-conflict setting. It offers a novel framework for understanding informal financial systems within global economic networks. The study expands the literature on climate-finance linkages, informal currency markets, and post-conflict monetary systems by demonstrating how unregulated exchange structures interact with both environmental shocks and formal global markets.",

      "description": "Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) and pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS, or “biochar carbon removal”) are two promising carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques that can contribute to soil restoration. These technologies can be combined by co-application of rock powder and biochar or by co-pyrolysis of rock powder with biomass to produce rock-enhanced (RE) biochar. In a 27-week laboratory experiment, we quantified the carbon (C) sink development of co-applications and RE-biochars produced by co-pyrolysis of basanite rock powder with either 50 or 90 wt% willow wood or 90 wt% wheat straw. Incubators featured two elevated soil pCO2 levels (0.012 and 0.062 atm, equivalent to about 1.2 and 6.2 Vol-% CO2) in a clay-rich, nutrient-poor Oxisol, with a simulated annual rainfall of 1,600 mm. Results showed strong initial fluxes of total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and major cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Na+), which decreased over time. Notably, elevated pCO2 had minimal impact on the release of DOC but doubled the TA flux from ERW. An important observation was the impact of waterlogging on water fluxes in soil columns without biochar, which lowered the amount of leached cations from rock and biochar. We defined the carbon sink (C-Sink) to include all DIC of geogenic and biogenic origin, and pyrogenic carbon from biochar. Biogenic cations were not considered as contributing to additional CO2 sequestration. For a soil application equivalent to application of 12 t ha−1, the total net C-Sink ranged from −0.1 to 30.9 t CO2 ha−1 after 27 weeks under 1.2 Vol-% CO2. We were not able to determine a change in rock weathering rates from co-pyrolysis since biogenic and geogenic cations could not be distinguished. A 20-year forecast suggests net C-Sinks between 0.5 t and 28.7 t CO2 ha−1, driven by increased contributions from weathering, alongside a C-Sink loss of carbon due to biochar mineralization. While biochar alone generally produces a larger C-Sink, co-application with rock powder fosters soil remineralization and provides a higher permanence of the C-Sink. Additionally, biochar increases water-holding capacity, prevents waterlogging of soils and likely improves the retention of organic carbon in soils.",

Projections were generated via 5,000 bootstrapped simulations, with a sensitivity analysis excluding COVID-19-attributed deaths.ResultsAugust 2023 reported 82 (95% CI: 55–100) excess deaths, with all-cause mortality 67% higher than expected (observed-to-expected mortality rate: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.38–2.00). Mortality peaked the week of August 19, with a 367% increase (67 excess deaths: 3.67; 2.65–5.96). Non-medical deaths increased from 68 to 80%.ConclusionThe Lāhainā wildfire caused substantial excess mortality, likely making wildfires a leading cause of death in Maui County during this period. Findings highlight the need for improved disaster preparedness. Policy Implications. Rebuilding must incorporate Native Hawaiian ecological knowledge. Policies should focus on restoring Indigenous wetlands, removing flammable invasive grasses, and ensuring environmental justice for Native Hawaiians.",

      "description": "The agriculture industry is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions globally with livestock production being a main contributor. Therefore, there is a need to reduce methane (CH4) emissions from livestock production, including liquid manure storages. Using an additive that decreases methanogenesis is one approach currently being considered. This study tests two additives: SOP® Lagoon (a commercial additive) and a commonly used, local fertilizer, gypsum. The objective was to determine the capability of the two products to reduce CH4 emissions. Tests were done at 24°C in the laboratory with multiple rates of the additives (100, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 g/m3). Methane produced by untreated dairy manure (control) was compared to manure with addition of gypsum or SOP® Lagoon over 162 days. Results showed that peak CH4 reduction occurred between 20 and 30 days, then declined. The lowest dose of both additives (100 g/m3) did not significantly reduce CH4 over the duration of the study. Efficacy increased non-linearly with an increasing dose up to 5,000 g/m3. After 30 days, CH4 reduction decreased by 32, 73, 74% for SOP® Lagoon rates 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 g/m3, and 20, 60, and 63% for gypsum. Both SOP® Lagoon and local gypsum showed similar reduction in methane emissions at similar application rates. This is an indication that farmers can confidently use locally sourced gypsum, a low-cost alternative to the commercial additive, without affecting the overall mitigation potential.",

      "description": "Beekeeping plays a vital role in global food security, contributing to the pollination of up to 30% of global food production and ensuring the sustainability of food supplies worldwide. However, climate change has significantly impacted beekeeping in recent years, affecting honeybees, pollination, and honey harvesting. Due to the effects of climate variability, which impose environmental strain on bees and beekeepers, modifications in management strategies and agricultural practices are essential to enhance biodiversity, guarantee agricultural sustainability, and ensure food security. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing beekeepers' intentions to adopt resilience strategies in response to climate change using protection motivation theory (PMT), the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and an extended PMT model. The study uses data obtained from a survey of 120 Tunisian beekeepers. The findings from the partial least squares analysis highlight the value and complementarity of the three models (TPB, PMT, and extended PMT), with the extended model offering superior explanatory and predictive power. The TPB model reveals the significant influence of perceived behavioral control and attitudes toward climate change resilience strategies on the intention to adopt them. The PMT model emphasizes the roles of self-efficacy, coping appraisal, and the perception of climate change occurrence in shaping adoption intentions, with self-efficacy being the most impactful factor. The extended PMT model further demonstrates that self-efficacy strongly influences perceived behavioral control. Overall, all three models show a positive and significant impact of intention on the selection of specific resilience strategies.",

      "description": "The growing urgency of climate change necessitates innovative strategies to enhance system resilience across many sectors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a transformative tool in this regard, yet existing research remains fragmented across sectors and regions. We conducted a systematic literature review of 385 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and early 2025, following the PRISMA protocol. The analysis classifies AI applications across nine key sectors and evaluates their relevance to adaptation, mitigation, or both. AI methodologies and regional distribution were also assessed. The findings show a dominant focus on adaptation (64.4%), with only 16% of studies addressing mitigation, and 19.4% engaging both. Classical Machine Learning techniques are the most used (51.4%), followed by deep learning models (22.3%). Regional disparities are evident: Asia and global-scale studies account for two-thirds of the literature, while Africa and South America are underrepresented. Sectorally, agriculture and urban infrastructure receive the most attention. Despite the promise of AI, major challenges persist in data access, model transparency, and equitable deployment, particularly in vulnerable regions. This review distinguishes itself by offering a comprehensive, cross-sectoral synthesis and emphasizing system-level resilience. It highlights the need for regionally tailored AI solutions, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical frameworks to ensure AI contributes meaningfully to global climate resilience efforts.",

      "description": "IntroductionIn regions where climate change is perceived to be a controversial topic, people often self-silence rather than explore their concerns by speaking with others in their local social networks. The “spiral of silence” is a social feedback loop in which individuals are reluctant to speak about an issue because they believe they hold a minority opinion, leading to anxiety and fear, which prohibit action. Facilitating conversations about climate change is therefore a crucial step for researchers concerned with enhancing adaptive capacity. The goal of this paper is to provide a road map for engaging rural communities in conversations about their lived experiences with and local knowledge related to climate and water-related risks (e.g., drought). Our research focuses on unwinding the spiral of silence through community engagement to address the following questions: 1. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive recent climate conditions and water-related risks; and 2. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive and discuss future climate scenarios?MethodsOur first research question is addressed through analysis of results from a statewide survey, which are used to develop prompts for a scenario planning workshop to support the second research question. Our second research question is addressed through transcription and coding of recorded discussions and responses during and after participatory scenario planning workshops in key communities around the state.ResultsResults from the statewide survey indicate that respondents largely agree that all seasons are getting warmer than in the past and that drought is the dominant water risk of concern; however, there is uncertainty about community preparedness. Inclusion of prompts in our participatory scenario planning workshops that were aligned with statewide survey results allowed shared communication opportunities among community members and identified local knowledge of past drought events and associated adaptation strategies for the future.DiscussionOur mixed-method approach provides an example for unwinding the spiral of silence in rural communities experiencing challenges and impacts of climate change.",

      "description": "This study aimed to evaluate precipitation estimates over the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) using high-resolution historical simulations from the MPI-ESM1-2-HR climate model, before and after regionalization with the RegCM4.7.1 model. Continuous 32-year simulations (1981-2012) were compared against observed precipitation data on a regular 0.5° × 0.5° grid over the BLA. Six experiments were conducted: (1) MPI, comparing raw MPI-ESM1-2-HR precipitation with observations; (2) REG, comparing regionalized MPI-ESM1-2-HR precipitation via RegCM4.7.1 with observations; and (3-6) four experiments applying two bias correction methods, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and principal component regression (PCR), to the MPI and REG out-puts, resulting in MPI-CCA, MPI-PCR, REG-CCA, and REG-PCR experiments. Monthly evaluations revealed very low average correlations (r) between the uncorrected simulations and observations: 0.008 for MPI and 0.013 for REG, with mean ab-solute errors (MAE) of 80 mm and 120 mm, and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 97 mm and 143 mm, respectively, indicating poor representation of observed climatology. However, the application of CCA and PCR substantially improved the simulations. MPI-CCA achieved r = 0.36, MAE = 43 mm, and RMSE = 54 mm, while REG-CCA reached r = 0.41, MAE = 42 mm, and RMSE = 53 mm. The best performance was observed with PCR: MPI-PCR showed r = 0.47, MAE = 40 mm, and RMSE = 51 mm, whereas REG-PCR obtained the highest accuracy with r = 0.52, MAE = 39 mm, and RMSE = 50 mm. These improvements were corroborated by Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) analysis, reinforcing its value as a metric for precipitation simulation assessment. Among all months, REG-PCR achieved superior correlation and lower errors in 8 out of 12 months (February, March, April, July, September, October, November, and December). MPI-PCR performed better in January, June, and August, while REG-CCA stood out only in May. These findings underscore the importance of bias correction, particularly PCR, in reducing uncertainties in future precipitation projections for the BLA. The results highlight the potential for applying PCR to model outputs to improve projections of climate extremes, thereby supporting strategic planning across multiple sectors in this critical region.",

      "description": "Climate change is already upon us. Millions of people are expected to be displaced due to the severe and slow-onset impacts. These displacements will lead to large-scale movements from high-risk and less resilient areas to safer or more resilient areas, creating a relocation problem: where people should go and when. This complex problem involves factors such as the source and extent of relocation demand, identification and capacity of destinations, movements from origins to destinations, and the well-being and dignity of both the displaced and receiving communities. We intend to solve the resulting relocation problem at different levels, starting with high-level decisions about which destinations to choose and how many people to send there. This will facilitate early preparations, such as infrastructure and service planning, at these destinations, ensuring timely action without delays. But in such a complicated problem, what could be the measure of the success of certain relocation decisions compared to others? We consider it requisite that the level of social integration at the destination locations and the fairness of the flow decisions are pivotal to a successful relocation plan and should be thoroughly analyzed. The moral imperative of fairness in these decisions cannot be overstated. That is why our study focuses on the fairness of movements within the context of a relocation problem: how many people from each origin should go to each climate destination in a way that is fair for both climate migrants and receiving communities. To this end, we formulate an optimization model such that the objectives and constraints reflect the key aspects of the relocation problem to assign the number of people to be relocated from each origin to each destination. The model incorporates multiple fairness metrics into objectives representing the perspectives of different stakeholders. These metrics are then analyzed and compared to evaluate trade-offs in the results.",

      "description": "Electrochemical technology can be used to remove inorganic carbon from seawater and facilitate the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Electrochemical ‘Direct Ocean Carbon Capture and Storage’ (DOCCS) is a marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) method that removes atmospheric CO2 by releasing low-carbon seawater into the surface ocean, where it re-equilibrates with the atmosphere and stores atmospheric CO2. At the point of release, DOCCS discharge has low concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and high pH, potentially causing unintended marine environmental impacts; however, its chemistry moves progressively towards that of ambient seawater as it dilutes and re-equilibrates with the atmosphere. To date, there are no published studies that investigate the impact of DOCCS discharge on marine ecosystems. Research from relevant analogues, where biological responses to low-DIC and/or high-pH seawater are investigated, provides some insight into potential DOCCS impacts. Despite this, significant evidence gaps remain. These evidence gaps are discussed alongside DOCCS-specific recommendations for future environmental impact research. Understanding the potential risks/benefits to marine ecosystems from discharge of low-DIC and high-pH seawater is critical to: (i) support licensing applications; (ii) develop any necessary mitigating actions; (iii) determine the net benefit of mCDR approaches; and (iv) stimulate informed public discourse about the acceptability of such approaches.",

      "description": "What happens to floodplain buyout sites after demolition of structures? Does ecological restoration or reconciliation of the floodplain occur? By what criteria should we assess what is on the site? Under what conditions do government programs promote more ecologically dynamic land management? We explore these questions in the context of four exemplary buyout programs in the United States that implement relocation out of flood risk zones through buyouts: Austin’s Watershed Protection Department, Texas; Harris County Flood Control District, Texas; Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s Stormwater Services, North Carolina; and Washington State’s Floodplains by Design. The analysis draws on staff interviews and GIS mapping, satellite imagery for 3,416 buyout parcels spanning 2,811 acres, and selected field verification. We test a framework for assessing buyouts that includes both pre- and post-buyout considerations as indicators along a spectrum from reconciliation to restoration. Our findings show that the status of most buyout parcels is “in-waiting,” as land management practices evolve to decide on their long-term use. Federal buyout requirements prevent redevelopment, but it is local and state priorities, goals, capacities, partnerships and levels of community engagement that shape land management outcomes and long-term human-nature relations. While the reconciliation-restoration debate often pits social against ecological goals, we find that they are mutually reinforcing, and that deep community engagement yields better outcomes overall. Floodplains are high value landscapes and should be prioritized for repair. State and federal governments can help achieve greater ecological and social outcomes from buyout sites by issuing more explicit guidance, technical assistance, and funding support to achieve these aims.",

      "description": "Given the pivotal role of climate risk in fostering sustainable corporate growth, this factor warrants further investigation in the context of low-carbon innovation. Drawing on firm-level data from Chinese enterprises during the 2007–2022 period, our research establishes climate risk as a significant driver of corporate low-carbon innovation, with transition risk proving more influential than physical risk. The analysis of underlying mechanisms reveals that climate risk stimulates low-carbon technological innovation primarily through two channels: increased research and development expenditures and enhanced environmental certification efforts. Examination of heterogeneous effects demonstrates that climate risk’s innovation-enhancing potential is particularly pronounced among three distinct groups: enterprises not designated as key pollution monitoring units, firms operating in less polluting industries, and businesses located in China’s eastern regions. These insights provide valuable implications for policymakers and businesses on leveraging climate risk to drive low-carbon innovation while achieving balanced sustainable development in terms of Research and Development investment and pollution control dimensions.",

      "description": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at gigaton-scale is essential to meet the Paris climate goals. Relevant CDR rates can only be achieved through the co-deployment of multiple CDR approaches. However, synergisms between different CDR methods and joint co-benefits beyond CDR have seldom been investigated. The combination of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) and enhanced weathering of minerals (Mi) for carbon capture and storage (CCS), in short PyMiCCS, presents a potentially synergetic and multifunctional approach that may be achieved by either co-application of biochar and rock powder to soils or the co-pyrolysis of biomass and rock powder before soil use. Here, we mixed biomass (wood; straw) with 10 to 50 wt% silicate rock powder (namely basanite or diabase) for co-pyrolysis to produce twelve different rock-enhanced (RE-)biochars. Products were subject to physico-chemical characterization, including an assessment of carbon yield and proxies for biochar persistence. Rock-enhanced biochars showed higher nutrient content, liming- and C-sink potential but lower solid-state electrical conductivity and porosity compared to pure biochars. Co-pyrolysis resulted in a coating of rock particles with secondary char but did not affect the net carbon yield. The thermal stability of wood-based RE-biochars (+10 wt% rock) was higher than that of pure woody biochars. However, the underlying mechanism and implications for biochar persistence in the environment need further investigation. Despite the addition of rock powder, the short-term release of ions from the ash fraction remains dominated by cations and anions of biogenic (biochar) origin. Therefore, it is still unclear whether the pyrogenic coating influences rock weathering. Co-pyrolysis with rock dust opens further options for designing biochar properties and to produce novel composite materials catering for multifunctional CDR.",

      "description": "IntroductionThis study examines effectiveness of Climate Information Services (CIS) in improving agricultural resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where their potential remains underutilized despite their significance in climate change adaptation.MethodsEmploying PRISMA methodology, we systematically reviewed 53 peer-reviewed articles published between 2010-2023, using inferential statistical analysis to assess factors influencing CIS adoption and effectiveness.ResultsThe results reveal that “What Works” are participatory models like Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA), which significantly enhance adoption rates, because they involve local communities in climate service design. “What Does not Work” are top-down models that do not consider local contexts, leading to low adoption. Barriers to CIS success include poor digital infrastructure, low literacy rates, and gender biases, hindering effective use.Discussion“Why” these approaches fail is due to disconnect between services offered and actual needs of farmers, with a lack of trust in externally provided information. In conclusion, CIS can significantly contribute to agricultural resilience if designed to be inclusive, context-specific, and participatory. The study recommends scaling up participatory models, enhancing digital infrastructure, and integrating CIS into national agricultural policies to improve accessibility, usability, and farmer engagement, thereby strengthening climate adaptation and resilience in SSA.",

      "description": "Flooding presents a significant challenge in the Lagos metropolis, driven by rapid urbanization, poor drainage infrastructure, and climate change. This study evaluates flood resilience strategies in Lagos, analyzing their effectiveness in mitigating flood risks and their alignment with the 2030 Agenda. The research utilizes the PICO (Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes) framework to refine research questions and follows PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines for study selection, search strategies, and data extraction. A thorough search across databases such as Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and government data repositories was conducted to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies while minimizing selection bias. The study emphasizes the severe impacts of flooding, referencing the 2022–2023 flood event which resulted in USD 262,500 damages and displaced 8000 residents in Lagos State. Current flood resilience strategies are inadequate to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to insufficient urban flood infrastructure, poor waste disposal practices, and worsening climatic conditions. The livelihoods, income, health, and overall survival of vulnerable communities are at significant risk. Key gaps identified include the weak enforcement of urban planning regulations, limited community engagement, ineffective early warning systems, and poor intervention initiatives. This study suggests a multi-stakeholder approach that enhances both structural and non-structural flood resilience. Improving drainage systems, promoting sustainable waste management, improving climate adaptation policies, and fostering community-based flood mitigation strategies are crucial for achieving long-term urban resilience. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and climate resilience advocates working toward the Sustainable Development Agenda in Lagos metropolis.",
