      "description": "Climate change adaptation aims to reduce vulnerability to climate impacts across various sectors. Current adaptation efforts appear inadequate as they do not address deep-rooted structural barriers such as inequality, exclusion, and weak governance. This limitation hinders the long-term sustainability of these adaptation efforts. This systematic review draws on Johan Galtung’s concept of positive peace, which encompasses equity, justice, and inclusion. It seeks to explore how integrating these principles into adaptation efforts might enhance their effectiveness and sufficiency. The article employed a systematic literature review method based on the PRISMA approach to evaluate scholarly and policy-focused research on the intersection of positive peace and climate adaptation. Several databases were utilized, including Scopus and Web of Science. Searches used key terms such as ‘climate adaptation’ and ‘successful.’ The inclusion criteria emphasized studies addressing adaptation beyond mere technical solutions and those considering justice, governance, and long-term sustainability. Galtung’s peace framework served as an interpretive lens. The findings from this study indicate that while positive peace concepts are not always explicitly utilized in adaptation literature, core elements—such as distributive, procedural, and recognitional justice—often appear as critical to successful outcomes. Additionally, climate adaptation practices that intentionally incorporate these principles tend to be more resilient, community-driven, and responsive to climate risks. A grounded demonstration of this finding is illustrated with a case from the Solomon Islands, showing how integrating peacebuilding approaches into community-based adaptation may enhance both resilience and social cohesion. Consequently, the paper proposes a conceptual framework linking positive peace dimensions with the criteria of adaptation success and adequacy. Integrating positive peace into climate adaptation may offer a pathway for addressing systemic barriers, especially in non-conflict settings. Furthermore, it could redefine adaptation from reactive risk management to proactive justice-centered planning. However, more research is necessary, as beyond this systematic review and a few case studies, empirical evidence remains scarce. Adaptation activities are often undocumented or assessed without justice metrics. Although empirical testing is needed, the study underscores that integrating positive peace may help deliver more sustainable outcomes in highly vulnerable regions.",

      "description": "This article provides a narrative review of recent literature on the health impacts of climate change, synthesizing epidemiological findings, mechanistic insights, and policy implications across major exposure domains. Anthropogenic climate change is fundamentally altering global climate systems, with significant and multifaceted implications for human health. Epidemiological data indicate a strong correlation between ambient temperature fluctuations and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, the frequency and severity of wildfires have intensified due to climate change, contributing to elevated levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and resulting in substantial premature mortality. Climate change is modifying the geographic distribution and seasonality of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, posing new challenges for infectious disease control. Air quality degradation alongside heightened UV radiation, contributes to a higher incidence of respiratory diseases, skin cancers, and ocular disorders. Climate-induced disruptions to agricultural systems are undermining food security, leading to increased malnutrition and related morbidity. Additionally, the psychological burden of climate-related events, including natural disasters and displacement, has been linked to rising rates of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and affective disorders. These effects are more evident in vulnerable populations, including the elderly, individuals with pre-existing health conditions, those of lower socioeconomic status, and populations residing in low-income countries. Urgent mitigation strategies targeting greenhouse gas emissions are required to limit further climate-related health burdens. Concurrently, adaptive strategies must be implemented to bolster resilience across ecological, infrastructural, and health systems. Although public health systems are critical in addressing these challenges, a coordinated, multidisciplinary research agenda is imperative to elucidate the complex pathways linking climate change and health, and to develop evidence-based interventions aimed to reduce its negative impacts on human health.",

      "description": "The digital economy, as a sustainable and innovative mechanism for economic change, has emerged as a crucial national strategic driver for China’s attainment of high-quality development and low-carbon transition. Assessing the digital economy’s contribution to both high-quality development and carbon reduction, as well as evaluating the extent of its effects, can offer accurate decision-making assistance for prioritizing development sectors and optimizing resource distribution. This research utilizes the Entropy Weight TOPSIS approach and spatial autocorrelation analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the digital economy and high-quality development in Guangdong Province. A coupling coordination model evaluates the extent of coordination between the two, while a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) is utilized to estimate the coefficients regarding the digital economy’s influence on both high-quality development and carbon emission reduction at the prefecture-level city size. The primary findings of the study are as follows: (1) Both the digital economy and high-quality development in Guangdong Province have progressively advanced, demonstrating notable spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I ranging from 0.21 to 0.36, p < 0.01). Nonetheless, development r is uneven, with the Pearl River Delta region significantly outpacing other areas. (2) The coupling coordination level between the digital economy and high-quality development exhibits fluctuating stability and significant regional disparities. The Pearl River Delta, particularly Shenzhen and Guangzhou, consistently achieves a coordination quality level exceeding 0.90, whereas Meizhou and Maoming frequently fall below 0.20, indicating severe discoordination. (3) The digital economy has a substantial beneficial impact and spatial spillover effect on both high-quality development and carbon reduction. The SDM findings reveal that the digital economy exerts a substantial direct influence on high-quality development (coefficient = 0.4837, p < 0.01), while demonstrating a slight negative impact on carbon emissions (coefficient = −0.2012, p < 0.05), thereby affirming that its impact on high-quality development is predominantly more pronounced than its influence on low-carbon development. This report recommends focused ways to enhance the digital economy’s fundamental role in fostering high-quality development while also realizing its promise for low-carbon synergy.",

      "description": "IntroductionClimate change presents profound public health challenges, particularly in low-income countries like Ethiopia. Chronic respiratory diseases and chronic respiratory symptoms, are exacerbated by environmental factors such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and occupational exposure. Despite its vulnerability, Ethiopia lacks comprehensive data on impacts of climate change on chronic respiratory health, limiting effective policy and intervention strategies. Therefore, the aims of this study to assess the impact of climate change on chronic respiratory health in Ethiopia.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and institutional repositories. Eligible studies focused on chronic respiratory diseases and chronic respiratory symptoms in Ethiopia and employed observational designs. Data extraction followed Joanna Briggs Institute protocols, and risk of bias was assessed using Hoy et al.’s checklist. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA 14, including pooled prevalence estimation using a random-effects model, subgroup analyses by region and study design, and publication bias assessment using Egger’s test and funnel plots.ResultsA total of 21 studies with 10,785 participants were included, the pooled prevalence of chronic respiratory health was 39% (95% CI: 31–48%). The most common symptoms were cough, phlegm, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), temperature, and altitude were reported as a significant contributor. Subgroup analysis revealed the highest prevalence in Oromia (61, 95% CI: 58–64%) and the lowest in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People Region (23, 95% CI: 13–33%). Study design influenced prevalence estimates, with cross-sectional studies reporting higher rates (46%) than case–control studies (14%). Significant heterogeneity (I2 = 99%, p < 0.001) was observed across studies.ConclusionThe findings highlight a substantial burden of chronic respiratory health in Ethiopia, resulting from climatic, environmental, and occupational exposures. Decreasing biomass fuel use, enhancing air quality, and incorporating climate adaptation measures into public health policy are key interventions.",

      "description": "Over the last years, food security in West Africa has been strongly influenced by increasing weather variability, including rising temperatures, irregular precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme events. These factors threaten traditional rain-fed agriculture, while population growth and urbanization are driving greater demand for rice—a crop increasingly replacing traditional staples. To reduce dependency on imports, West African countries are seeking to expand domestic rice production. Inland valleys and floodplains, due to their high water retention and fertile soils, offer significant but underutilized potential for rice cultivation. To assess the suitability and current extent of rice cropping, we selected Burkina Faso as a representative country in West Africa that exemplifies the challenges outlined above. Inland valleys were delineated using a digital elevation model (SRTM), and rice cropping areas in 2020 were mapped using a random forest classifier applied on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite time series. The classification was based on temporal-spectral metrics, including vegetation indices such as NDVI and backscatter statistics, and validated against reference samples to assess accuracy. Climatic suitability from 1999 to 2021 was evaluated using ERA5-Land reanalysis data, based on crop growth requirements of rice across different growth stages. Only 0.71% of Burkina Faso’s land is currently used for rice cropping, closely matching national FAO statistics (0.74%) and independent mapping efforts. However, approximately 10% of the national territory consists of inland valleys, which are biophysically suitable for rice cultivation. While the southwestern regions show relatively stable climatic suitability, the central and northern areas are more variable and vulnerable to drought, limiting their long-term potential without irrigation. The integration of climatic suitability and landform-based potential highlights considerable opportunities for expanding rice cultivation in Burkina Faso. This study provides a spatial decision-support framework for policymakers to guide sustainable intensification, reduce import dependency, and adapt agricultural systems to climate change.",

      "description": "Climate change poses a serious threat to human health and is a key driver of both health system stress and disaster-related health impacts. As climate-related crises become more frequent and intense, the likelihood of climate-induced disasters increases, bringing a wide range of health consequences, including climate-sensitive diseases (CSDs) and exacerbating health inequities. Strengthening disaster preparedness in health facilities is essential for managing increased service demands, ensuring continuity of care, and minimizing the impact of disasters on communities. However, there is limited evidence on how well health facilities are prepared to manage climate-related disasters and deliver CSD diagnosis and treatment services, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Nepal. This study aims to address that gap by linking data from the 2021 Nepal health facility Service Provision Assessment survey with local-level climate-related disaster data from the Nepal Disaster Risk Portal (2018–2020). We explore climate related disaster preparedness and the availability of CSD-related services across different types of health facilities, assessing overall emergency preparedness and the availability of six CSD services based on their past exposure to disasters. Furthermore, we compare differences in preparedness and CSD service availability between facilities with high and low levels of disaster exposure. The study provides an overview of how well various types of health facilities are prepared to respond to climate-related disasters and CSDs, while also highlighting disparities in preparedness and service availability across facility types. Although the findings indicate some degree of adaptation of some type of health facilities to climate-related disaster exposure, it calls for comprehensive assessments that integrate all components of a climate-resilient health system as defined by the WHO, to support evidence-based planning and strengthen Nepal’s progress toward a climate-resilient health system.",

      "description": "Amidst rapid urbanization and an increasing frequency of extreme events, urban climate stress is intensifying and potentially affecting wet-bulb temperature (WBT), a key indicator of human-perceived thermal stress. This study examined the combined effects of urbanization and extreme events on the WBT dynamics in Guangdong Province, a humid tropical region in China. Using long-term meteorological data spanning five decades and urbanization metrics, we systematically analyzed urban–rural WBT differences using paired station comparisons and quantified the contribution of urbanization. Key findings highlight urban–rural WBT differences across three distinct urbanization stages: (a) Initial urbanization, where heat island effects dominate and amplify WBT differences; (b) Rapid urbanization, characterized by impervious surface expansion that widens WBT disparities to their peak, with the urban–rural difference increasing by 0.0027° C decade−1 (p < 0.001); and (c) Mature urbanization (e.g., Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, GBA), where dry island effects reduce humidity, thereby narrowing urban–rural gaps. Furthermore, extreme weather events alter these urban–rural WBT patterns. High-temperature and compound heat-drought events can reduce WBT differences, in some cases by a factor of three, while periods of extreme precipitation can amplify them. These findings underscore the critical impacts of urbanization and extreme events on urban thermal stress. This understanding is crucial for evaluating human heat stress and informing urban risk planning, particularly in the context of advancing urbanization and climate change in urban agglomerations.",

      "description": "Climate change has emerged as one of the most significant threats to global biodiversity, and climate adaptation has become a critical component of biodiversity conservation. This paper reviews adaptive management strategies for enhancing biodiversity resilience under climate change, based on a cross-scale framework. The findings reveal that: (1) Biodiversity conservation adaptation to climate change requires a cross-spatial scale framework, which highlights the vertical interaction and interdependencies between regional, landscape, and site-level strategies. (2) Adaptive management strategies vary across spatial scales. At the regional scale, dynamic planning based on assessment and monitoring is prioritized. Landscape-scale initiatives emphasize protected areas as the core, expanding their scope while restructuring networks through corridors, stepping stone, habitat matrix permeability, and climate refugia. At the site scale, efforts focus on in situ and ex situ conservation of keystone species, along with real-time monitoring of invasive species. (3) Future challenges in biodiversity conservation under climate change may include social inequity in adaptation efforts, delayed responses in dynamic landscape conservation planning, disruptions to species’s ecological networks, barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration, and insufficient attention to human-climate interactions. By highlighting the differential application of adaptation strategies across spatial scales and underscoring the critical importance of cross-scale collaboration, our findings provide important insights for advancing research and practice in biodiversity adaptation to climate change, offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing multi-level, operable climate-adaptive conservation policies.",

      "description": "This study investigates key determinants influencing donor fulfillment rates (DFR) in the context of global climate finance. Using panel data analysis, the study examines the impact of pledged and deposited funds, EU membership, and fund type on donor fulfillment. The Random Effects model was validated through a Hausman test and used to interpret the main results. The analysis reveals that higher pledged amounts are significantly associated with lower fulfillment rates, while actual deposited funds positively and strongly affect DFR. EU membership consistently improves donor fulfillment, suggesting that institutional alignment matters, whereas fund type showed no significant influence in the RE model. The findings suggest a need for more realistic pledging practices, stronger monitoring and accountability mechanisms, and institutional frameworks that promote follow-through on financial commitments. This study introduces a novel empirical variable—EU membership—to assess how regional affiliation influences donor behavior. This study offers a new lens to evaluate the effectiveness of international climate finance commitments. The research advances the Principal–Agent Theory, Institutional Theory, and Rational Choice Theory to explain donor behavior. It fills a critical gap in empirical literature by distinguishing between the effects of pledges versus actual deposits, highlighting the role of regional institutional contexts.",

      "description": "Many countries, including Germany, have made their climate targets dependent on the implementation of methods for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Actors in the agricultural sector can contribute to this implementation. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding carbon dioxide removal (CDR) among agricultural actors. In this study, we interviewed 34 agricultural actors at the micro, meso, and macro levels to identify the factors hindering the implementation of CDR practices, namely soil carbon sequestration, biochar, and agroforestry. We identified 22 information needs related to the dimensions of Climate change mitigation, Technological conditions, Environmental impacts, Economics, Policy & government, and Social aspects from the interviews. Farmers expressed more information needs compared with representatives from farming associations or local and regional administrations. Across all interviews, recommendations for action were most requested, with a high preference for information in digital online formats. Our findings provide a checklist for future research in the form of co-developed actionable knowledge between researchers and agricultural actors to increase the knowledge but especially the use of agricultural practices to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

This research adds to a growing body of work focused on youth climate change engagement by testing whether physical exposure to climate risks influences middle school and high school students’ intentions to engage in pro-climate behaviors above and beyond several previously identified social and psychological variables. A total of 222 middle and high school students across 11 states were surveyed to measure cognitive, social, and demographic factors known to influence pro-climate behavior. We combined this survey data with data from a national assessment of climate risks and conducted a hierarchical regression model predicting intentions to engage in pro-climate behaviors. Physical exposure to climate risks was not a significant predictor in our model. Rather, we found that the only significant predictors of behavioral intentions were perceived risks of climate change and frequency of discussions with friends and family. Since the size and geographic distribution of our sample was limited, future research is needed to build on these findings and the role youth may play in mitigating climate change.",

      "description": "Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) presents a promising means to leverage the ocean carbon sink to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic climate change. We report on a series of mesocosm experiments simulating electrodialysis-based OAE through the addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide to seawater in large tanks (~6,000 L) and small aquaria (~10 L) at Flax Pond Marine Laboratory, NY. In previous studies, the confounding effects of biological processes were controlled by imposing a sterilization treatment to seawater throughout each experiment. Here, we take the first steps in characterizing the influence of biological processes on OAE-based CO2 uptake through comparisons between sterilized and unsterilized mesocosms and aquaria. We combine our results with those of similar Flax Pond mesocosm experiments and develop a model to identify the most influential variables for determining the rate and magnitude of CO2 uptake. We found that the rate of CO2 uptake varies with changes in initial carbonate chemistry, the amount of alkalinity added, whether the mesocosm was sterilized, and the season in which the seawater was collected. Our model suggests that sterilized tanks did not differ in the amount of CO2 sequestered, but experienced a slower rate of equilibration relative to unsterilized tanks. These results indicate that laboratory mesocosm experiments could reasonably represent CO2 uptake in the field even with the complication of biological processes over the timeline of air-sea CO2 equilibration. This finding is valuable in supporting the measurement, reporting and verification of OAE, which must rely on a combination of laboratory data, near-field measurements, and modeling exercises.",

      "description": "The Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River Basin is a critical ecological barrier and core production base (energy, agriculture, animal husbandry) in northern China, where water resource security and ecological sustainability directly affect regional and national development. Drought is a major constraint on the basin’s ecosystem and production activities, but its long-term spatial-temporal patterns and driving mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Here, we used MOD16 evapotranspiration data (2001-2024) to construct the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), aiming to clarify drought evolution in the region, and applied the Geodetector model to identify key drivers of CWSI spatial heterogeneity and their interactions. Our results showed that: (1) Potential evapotranspiration (PET) and CWSI had stable interannual fluctuations, while actual evapotranspiration (ET) exhibited significant interannual variability; the average CWSI was 0.85, indicating long-term severe drought in the study area. (2) Spatially, most regions were in severe drought, but >76% of the area showed a significant downward CWSI trend (drought alleviation). (3) All land use types had decreasing CWSI; water bodies had the highest CWSI and cropland the lowest—opposite to the ET ranking. (4) NDVI and air temperature were the primary drivers of CWSI spatial variability (average q-values >0.5). The strongest interactive effects on CWSI heterogeneity were between precipitation and temperature (q: 0.72-0.95) and between precipitation and DEM (q: 0.78-0.93), with both interactive q-values >0.81. These findings reveal that drought in the basin is regulated more by ET than PET, and is driven by the synergy of meteorological factors (precipitation, temperature) and topographic factors (DEM). They provide a scientific basis for drought prediction, water resource management, and ecological protection in the Yellow River Basin, and offer a reference for similar arid/semi-arid regions globally.",

This research investigates the climate change perceptions and adaptive capacity of strategies of male and female groundnut farmers in island of Hatiya, Bangladesh where nut yields fall below the national average.MethodsData were gathered from 170 male and 130 female farmers on the island, with Chi-square tests used to analyze gender-based differences in perceptions of climate change and adaptive capacity. A probit regression model was applied to evaluate the factors driving the adoption of these strategies.Results and discussionThe findings suggest that male and female farmers largely share similar perceptions of climate change impacts, such as changes in rainfall patterns, increased pest infestations, and a greater need for fertilizers. Consequently, a combined analysis of both genders was conducted to identify the factors influencing adaptive capacity of strategies. Additionally, the results indicated that older farmers are more likely to engage in off-farm activities as a strategy to cope with environmental uncertainties. Education and farming experience are key factors in driving crop diversification and climate-smart practices, with farmers adjusting planting dates, shifting crops, and using weather forecasts as the most common adaptive capacity. Less frequently adopted strategies include agroforestry and urban migration. Education and farming experience are positively associated with the adoption of proactive adaptive capacity, thereby improving farmers’ ability to cope with climate change. This study exploring adaptive capacity of nut farmers in Bangladesh’s island and suggests interventions to enhance resilience and encourage sustainable agricultural practices in response to climate change.",

      "description": "Enhanced weathering (EW) is cited as a promising carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy, and is being rapidly commercialized. Rigorous monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) are essential to ensure carbon claims are accurate and carbon credits are not mis-sold. MRV protocols incorporate multiple approaches, including soil and porewater sampling. This paper calculates potential CDR (pCDR) from porewater (direct pCDR), via an alkalinity estimation calculated from charge balance, and from soil samples (inferred pCDR), via the accumulation of exchangeable cations on soil exchange sites. These pCDR estimations are then compared to the maximum theoretical CDR potential. The data were collected from a 1.5 year field trial, situated in south-east Scotland. Crushed basalt was surface-applied to plots at rates of 0 (control), 23, 78 and 126 t ha−1. Application rates were increased relative to common agricultural spreading practices (78 and 126 t ha−1) to increase the chances of detecting a signal. To calculate direct pCDR from porewater, ion concentrations of porewater samples extracted from a depth of 5 and 10 cm were integrated with precipitation surplus to estimate the flux of cations leaching from each depth over c. 2 week periods, as water budgets allowed. Ordinary least squares model results identified a significant effect of treatment as an explanatory variable for potential CDR, both at 5 and 10 cm depth. Direct pCDR ranging from 0.33 to 0.53 tCO2 ha−1 after c. 1.5 years of weathering was calculated in the 5 cm depth treatment in the 78 and 126 t ha−1 application treatment relative to the control. The model prediction interval was overlapping between the control and the 23 t ha−1 treatment at 5 cm depth, as well as for all the treatments in the 10 cm treatments when evaluated relative to the control. Carbonate precipitation was also assessed, but remained below the detection limit (0.1 wt.% inorganic carbon). Inferred pCDR calculated from 30 cm-deep soil samples were not significant, possibly as a result of experimental design and sampling density. Overall, when direct pCDR is normalized to mass of rock applied and duration of weathering (e.g., mass-time-normalized-pCDR), the values fall within the mid-range of values published from other field studies.",

      "description": "In recent years, Europe has experienced a notable increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires. These events have had profound impacts on human life, infrastructure, ecosystems, and economies, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective climate services to prevent, manage and timely respond to associated impacts. The aim of this paper is to describe and validate the European Extreme Climate Index (E3CI), designed as a climate service that allows monitoring the occurrence and severity of extreme weather dynamics across Europe. Starting from data provided by ERA5, the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalyzes produced by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which covers the entire globe from 1940, E3CI provides insights regarding variations and trends in seven specific dynamics associated with extreme weather events: Extreme Maximum Temperatures, Extreme Minimum Temperatures, Extreme Precipitations, Extreme Winds, Hail, Droughts, and Fires. For each of these, the E3CI collects information at monthly scale in terms of anomalies compared to a reference climatological time span (1981–2010), therefore enabling back-analyses on specific territories, highlighting areas subject to significant weather-induced criticalities. E3CI has proven effective in identifying the spatial distribution and intensity of the extreme precipitation and extreme wind events in the areas affected by powerful storms Dudley, Eunice, and Franklin, as well as the significant heat waves in the summer of 2022 and the extreme precipitation in Emilia Romagna in May 2023. Such index offers numerous application opportunities for businesses, institutions, and communities, in the vein of profound innovation in climate risk management and extreme weather events policies. Its flexible and dynamic nature allows for the production of customizable analysis based on the specific user needs including the ability to refine geographic areas to a radius of approximately 30 km. The data are made available for visualization and download through a dedicated portal, which is updated monthly. Additionally, a Newsletter for subscribers provides information about major events across Europe and their assessment by the corresponding components of E3CI.",

      "description": "Planned relocation is increasingly recognized as a necessary response to escalating climate risks, yet little is known about how such decisions unfold at the community level. Drawing on dialogs and field visits at seven iTaukei (Indigenous Fijian) villages across Fiji, this report examines how communities are experiencing and responding to climate-related challenges. Findings reveal cascading impacts—including flooding, land loss, disrupted livelihoods, and psychological stress—that have prompted a range of adaptation strategies, from in-situ adjustments to full or partial relocation, with mixed outcomes. Despite growing pressures, most communities expressed a strong, culturally grounded preference to remain in place. Challenges in reaching consensus and securing funding reflect the complexity of relocation processes. Moreover, traditional governance structures do not always ensure equal participation, highlighting the importance of attending to intra-community dynamics. To minimize loss and damage while ensuring agency and resilience of frontline communities, climate mobility frameworks will need to support anticipatory planning, uphold community agency, and recognize immobility as a legitimate and often preferred option.",

      "description": "Hydrological models are essential tools for water resource management and for mitigating extreme hydrological events risks. Although they are crucial for flood forecasting, these models often exhibit substantial uncertainties, including input data uncertainties (e.g., precipitation) and structural uncertainties of the models themselves. This study aims to explore the implications of different precipitation datasets and hydrological model structures on streamflow simulation, by evaluating the effects of multiple precipitation products and employing an enhanced model version to reduce structural uncertainty. This study evaluated the hydrological applicability of three representative precipitation products—reanalysis-based (the land component of the fifth-generation European Reanalysis, ERA5-Land), satellite-based (Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM, IMERG), and machine learning-based (the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale, spateGAN-ERA5), using the offline version of WRF-Hydro, a distributed hydrological model. Additionally, this study evaluated the performance of an enhanced version of WRF-Hydro, incorporating an overbank flow module for reducing the model structural uncertainty in a large, flood-prone tropical river basin, Irrawaddy River Basin in Myanmar. The findings indicate that: (1) Simulations driven by IMERG precipitation outperformed those driven by ERA5-Land and spateGAN-ERA5 in terms of accuracy in streamflow, with average NSE values of 0.77, compared to 0.19 and 0.09, respectively; (2) The modified model with enabled overbank flow showed consistent improvements over the default model. The average NSE improved from 0.09–0.77 (default) to 0.31–0.78 (modified); (3) The water balance analysis reveals that incorporating the overbank flow module reduces surface runoff, accompanied by an increase in soil moisture storage, and slightly enhancing underground runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) during the rainy period. After the end of the rainy period, the increase soil moisture storage gradually contributes to an increase in surface runoff. These results highlight the significant impact of accurate precipitation data and the overbank flow module on hydrological processes, particularly in flood-prone areas, and suggest that the modified model and high quality precipitation data may enhance hydrological forecasting capabilities.",

      "description": "China has put forward the “carbon peak and carbon neutral” climate commitment, but as the basic unit of the national economy, China’s county economy is facing the double pressure of economic growth and emission reduction. Based on panel data spanning 1677 Chinese counties from 2014 to 2022, this study employs fixed-effects, mediation, moderation, and quantile models to analyze and derive the following conclusions. (1) digital financial inclusion has a significant impact on the improvement of county carbon productivity, with an influence coefficient as high as 19.44%. (2) Digital financial inclusion enhances county-level carbon productivity by promoting technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. The positive moderating effects of traditional finance and urbanization further amplify this impact. Digital financial inclusion exerts a strong positive effect on carbon productivity at lower quantiles, but its influence diminishes at median quantiles and turns negative at higher quantiles. This pattern reflects diminishing marginal returns and tightening resource constraints as development approaches the technological frontier. (3) Only digitalization level and coverage breadth of digital financial inclusion have a significant positive impact on county carbon productivity, and the effect of digitalization level is almost twice that of coverage breadth. The influence coefficients of digital inclusive finance on carbon productivity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Yellow River Basin are 21.72% and 27.82%, respectively, which are more significant than those in other places. This paper recommends prioritizing low-carbon industrial development, shifting focus to less-developed regions to leverage latecomer advantages, and embedding carbon productivity targets into regional strategies with incentive mechanisms to drive sustainable growth.",
