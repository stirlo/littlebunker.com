      "description": "At the razor’s edge of the Anthropocene, Fiji offers the world not a plea for help, but a masterclass in survival: turning existential threat into a radical blueprint for planetary endurance. This review interrogates Fiji’s holistic climate resilience framework as a frontline small island developing state. The central research question asks: How has Fiji integrated national legislation, catalytic climate finance, rights-based mobility, and strategic diplomacy to construct a comprehensive governance model, and to what extent can this emergent architecture serve as a transferable blueprint for anticipatory adaptation in the Anthropocene? A systematic synthesis of scientific literature, policy texts, and institutional reports deconstructs Fiji’s multi-scalar response into a coherent conceptual model. The analysis advances the “Archipelagic Resilience Model,” structured around four interdependent pillars. Geopolitical Acupuncture leverages Fiji’s moral authority to exert influence in global climate governance. Braided Resilience entwines indigenous ecological knowledge, particularly the Vanua worldview, with contemporary climate science. Catalytic Finance mobilizes resources through innovative mechanisms such as sovereign blue and green bonds. Socially-Just Climate Mobility pioneers a rights-based relocation framework that safeguards dignity and cultural continuity. While innovative, this model exposes tensions, including the development–adaptation paradox and risks of maladaptation. By articulating both synergies and contradictions, the study reframes Fiji as a norm entrepreneur and blueprint for planetary resilience. It establishes a forward-looking research agenda to quantify braided systems and scale equitable adaptation pathways in vulnerable contexts.",

      "description": "Extreme weather events (EWEs) are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, disrupting healthcare systems and increasing risks for vulnerable populations. In low- and middle-income countries, these disruptions threaten progress in HIV and tuberculosis (TB) care by limiting access, straining services, and worsening health outcomes. Building health system resilience through environmentally sustainable infrastructure and processes, adequate and skilled workforce, and community engagement is essential to ensure continuity of care. In this four-year study (ASTRA), we aim to co-design, prioritise and evaluate interventions to strengthen community and health system resilience to EWEs for people living with HIV/TB. This multi-phase, mixed-methods study will be conducted in Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia, countries which are highly vulnerable to EWEs such as storms, cyclones and flooding and bear a high burden of HIV and TB. Phase 1 will focus on understanding the context through stakeholder mapping, scoping interviews, a Delphi consensus process, and assessments of community and health facility vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We will carry out rapid ethnographic assessments [also known as Broad Brush Surveys (BBS)], spatial and statistical modelling, and a policy and programme analysis in this phase. Phase 2 will involve four sequential co-creation workshops in each country to produce prototype interventions that will be refined and prioritised for evaluation. In Phase 3, we will evaluate selected interventions using system dynamics modelling and economic analysis. Using systems dynamics modelling, we will model the final set of interventions, individually and in combination, to explore their potential effects on service delivery during EWEs. The economic evaluation will estimate the costs of inaction, assess the benefits of interventions through multi-criteria decision analysis, and determine their value for money to inform priority setting and policy action. Overall, the innovative use of participatory co-creation processes, system dynamics modelling, and economic evaluation, provides a model for designing and assessing adaptation interventions that are both evidence-based and locally relevant. ASTRA will inform national policy and planning and offer transferable knowledge for other climate-vulnerable settings facing similar challenges.",

      "description": "Climate change is intensifying storm surge risks in Southeast Asia, particularly along Malaysia’s east coast facing the South China Sea. This study uses the d4PDF climate dataset to simulate maximum storm surge heights under 2 °C and 4 °C global warming scenarios. Results show that projected surge heights exceed 1 meter at all key coastal stations, with localized surges reaching up to 1.8 meters. By integrating these projections with 2014–2024 flood loss statistics and national budget allocations, the study identifies a concerning mismatch between increasing storm surge risks and current mitigation investments, suggesting that existing policy frameworks are underfunded and may lack the capacity to adequately protect high-risk coastal areas. To address this, the study recommends the development of a unified regional storm surge prediction and response system that integrates real-time data and supports cross-border coordination. It also proposes the establishment of standardized infrastructure guidelines tailored to storm surge resilience, and calls for increased investment in community-based risk mapping powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These strategies provide an actionable framework for strengthening disaster management, improving policy responsiveness, and enhancing coastal resilience across Malaysia and Southeast Asia.",

      "description": "This study explores climate dynamics and resilience of small-scale irrigation facilities in the Sissala West District of north-western Ghana. A multiple cross-sectional case study design was used. We randomly and proportionately sampled 208 small-scale irrigation farmers for the study. We used questionnaire, Focus Group Discussions, and semi-structured interviews for data collection. The quantitative data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, while thematic analysis was applied in analysing the qualitative data. The findings indicate that rainfall variability and high temperatures pose serious threats to irrigation dams and dugouts, resulting in their inability to have enough water for dry-season farming. The irrigation farmers, therefore, experienced low yields, low income, and loss of investment. Variability of rainfall, high evapotranspiration, and scarcity of irrigation water were responsible for the under-utilisation of irrigation assets in the district. Planting of trees around reservoirs; addressing erosion using vetiva grass on the embankment of the dams and dugouts, regular maintenance of lateral canals, avoidance of farming very close to the basins and river beds to the dams can address siltation. The District Assembly needs to prioritise the rehabilitation and regular monitoring and supervision mechanisms in collaboration with the user communities to promote the achievement of long-term benefits of dry season farming.",

In this perspective piece, we outline some of the approaches to responsible research and innovation (RRI) being put to work in a United Kingdom-based programme organising field trials of various carbon removal methods. Unlike the disruptive technologies that predominate in RRI scholarship, many land-based methods for carbon removal have already been deployed, in some cases over many decades, with governance closely linked with longstanding fields of research and practice. We highlight why responsible innovation frameworks that developed in the context of geoengineering controversies may be only partially-suited to field trials of land-based carbon removal methods. We suggest that field trials of carbon removal methods are not simply evidentiary procedures but also strategic sites within an emerging innovation regime where RRI approaches can be both implemented and critically tested.",

      "description": "Tropical monsoons are crucial atmospheric phenomena that impact more than two-thirds of the global population. Numerous previous studies have investigated changes in tropical circulation under climate change for individual ocean basins. In this review, we synthesize the robust changes in tropical atmospheric circulations and precipitation under a warming climate using CMIP6 data for illustration. Sea surface temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover are enhanced over the central and eastern Pacific, similar to El-Niño. In the Indian Ocean basin, the sea surface warming pattern is similar to the positive Indian Ocean Dipole phase, with low-level easterly anomalies in the central tropical Indian Ocean, which diverge into two anticyclones off the east coast of Africa. In the Atlantic, a larger increase in sea surface temperature is simulated along the eastern equatorial Atlantic, like an east Atlantic El-Niño condition. An increase in summer monsoon precipitation over South Asia and a decrease over North and South America, the Maritime continent, and Southern Africa are simulated. In the Northern African monsoon region, an east–west asymmetry is projected with a decrease in rainfall in the west and an increase in the east. The interconnection between the identified robust changes in circulation and precipitation over the three oceanic basins under a warming climate has been explored via earlier studies and model simulations. This review provides a holistic picture of regional tropical circulation and precipitation changes under a warming climate.",

      "description": "IntroductionRainfall regimes across West Africa have undergone substantial transformations over the past four decades, with profound implications for rainfed agriculture and food security. However, limited understanding persists on how rainfall extremes translate into spatially differentiated crop yield responses across agroclimatic zones.MethodsThis study integrates multi-decadal climate datasets with crop yield data from the Global Dataset of Historical Yields (GDHY) to assess the sensitivity of maize, rice, and soybean yields to hydroclimatic extremes across six agroclimatic zones. A sensitivity analysis using an Ordinary Least Squares regression framework quantified crop yield responses to key climatic variations across multi-decadal timescales, agroclimatic zones, and administrative units.ResultsResults reveal marked north–south contrasts in rainfall extremes. In the Sahelian and Sudanian zones, seasonal rainfall increased by 5%–25% since the 1990s and up to 80% in the Northern Sahel by 2024, largely driven by more frequent wet days and intensified rainfall events. These trends heighten flood and erosion risks in northern regions. Conversely, the Guinean zones exhibit stagnating or declining rainfall, coupled with over a 90% increase in consecutive dry days in Central Guinea, signaling intensifying drought stress. Crop yield responses associated with these hydroclimatic patterns. Maize yields increased by 40%–50% in the Sahelian, Sudanian, and parts of the Guinean zones, while rice yields declined by 20%–50% in Nigeria’s Sudanian and Eastern Guinea regions. Soybean showed localized yield gains but remained extremely sensitive to rainfall deficits and heat extremes.DiscussionBy linking rainfall variability to spatially explicit yield responses, this study provides a novel multi-decadal sensitivity framework for evaluating climate impacts on agriculture in West Africa. The findings highlight the urgent need for region-specific, climate-smart adaptation strategies, emphasizing flood and erosion management in the north and drought resilience in the south, to sustain food production under increasing climatic variability.",

      "description": "IntroductionThe 2nd Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in September 2025, marked a significant shift in Africa’s climate leadership, positioning the continent not only as a victim of climate change but also as a key solutions provider. Africa faces severe climate impacts despite contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions, with consequences including health crises and economic losses. This paper explores the outcomes of ACS2 and the intersection of climate action and health resilience, outlining the continent’s commitments to renewable energy, climate finance, and nature-based solutions.MethodsThis study employs a policy review and analytical synthesis of official summit documents, including the Addis Ababa Declaration, technical reports, and expert session transcripts. Data was coded and analyzed across five key themes: climate finance, renewable energy, climate-health integration, nature-based solutions, and global climate diplomacy. The research also incorporates media briefings and partner reports to provide a comprehensive understanding of ACS2’s commitments and challenges.ResultsACS2 produced groundbreaking commitments, such as the launch of the African Climate Facility (ACF) to mobilize $50 billion annually for climate solutions and the integration of health resilience in climate policy. The Addis Ababa Declaration emphasized climate justice, linking development and climate action. Key initiatives, such as the Africa Green Industrialization Initiative and the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, demonstrate Africa’s commitment to green industrialization and environmental restoration. The summit also prioritized renewable energy, setting ambitious targets for clean energy access and green growth.DiscussionWhile ACS2 marks a pivotal moment in Africa’s climate diplomacy, several implementation challenges remain, including financing gaps and institutional capacity constraints. Despite substantial financial pledges, Africa’s climate finance needs far exceed current commitments, and there are concerns regarding the adequacy of climate finance mechanisms. The paper discusses how ACS2’s outcomes align with Africa’s broader climate goals and offers policy recommendations for overcoming barriers to implementation. Additionally, it underscores the inseparability of climate justice and health resilience, stressing the importance of integrated solutions to both climate and health crises.",

      "description": "This article examines how value systems and place-based characteristics shape the ways in which local communities define, represent and prioritise climate risks in urban and rural settings. Drawing on 10 climate impact-chain assessments—co-developed through participatory processes with stakeholders in demonstration regions across Europe within the EU project VALORADA—we explore four hazard domains: urban warming, heatwaves, droughts and extreme precipitation. Building on previous literature and based on our observations, we show that the identification, definition and prioritisation of climate risks extend beyond biophysical aspects or existential threats and are also influenced by locally salient values, including sustainability, security, safety, identity, human health, cooperation and trust. These values can, at times, come into tension—particularly where the management of scarce resources (e.g., water) is contested, or where policy goals such as environmental conservation and economic development intersect within the same decision arena. We conclude by suggesting that addressing the challenge of integrating value-based and place-specific characteristics into climate risk assessments may benefit from illustrating how climate hazards influence local value frameworks and shape meaningful societal participation.",

      "description": "IntroductionAs climate governance increasingly adopts multilevel approaches, subnational actors play a central role in achieving national and global climate objectives. However, in Nigeria, as in many other developing countries, the role of subnational actors in climate governance remains underexplored. Understanding their institutional readiness is crucial for meeting national climate commitments, including the 2060 net-zero target. This paper presents the first comprehensive assessment of climate awareness, policy, and action across all 36 Nigerian states.MethodsUsing a mixed-methods design, the study combined document and budget reviews, a national survey of 1,306 respondents from relevant ministries and agencies, and a stakeholder validation workshop with over 600 participants. Indicators examined included climate literacy, policy presence and alignment, budgetary commitments, and inter-agency coordination.ResultsFindings reveal low climate knowledge among subnational officials, weak public awareness, and limited policy development. Only a handful of states, possess climate policies or action plans, and fewer than 20% have climate-related budget lines. Cross-sectoral collaboration and alignment with national frameworks are also weak.DiscussionThese gaps expose structural and institutional weaknesses that undermine Nigeria’s multilevel climate governance. Achieving the 2060 net-zero goal requires harmonized subnational frameworks, enhanced capacity-building, and innovative tools—such as performance-based disclosure and rating systems—to incentivize accountability and stimulate stronger state-level climate action. Positioned within debates on multilevel governance, the study highlights Nigeria as a critical test case of how federated system in the Global South can recalibrate institutions to transform symbolic commitments into substantive action.",

      "description": "The convective boundary layer height (CBLH) plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric mixing and land-atmosphere interactions, yet its spatiotemporal variability in the arid, topographically complex Xinjiang region of northwestern China remains insufficiently understood. Using ERA5-Land reanalysis (1985–2024 for CBLH; 2000–2024 for driving factors) and GLASS LAI data for April–September, CBLH characteristics and trends were investigated through the Mann–Kendall test, Theil–Sen slope estimation, multiple linear regression (MLR), and principal component analysis (PCA). Results show that the Tarim and Junggar Basins exhibit higher CBLH than the surrounding mountains, with seasonal peaks in June–July. From 2000 to 2024, a significant CBLH increase occurred in the Tianshan Mountains during July, while a marked decline was observed over the Taklamakan Desert in August. MLR results indicate that August CBLH over the Taklamakan is enhanced by strong surface heating but constrained by the cooling and moistening effects of nearby oases. In contrast, July CBLH over the Tianshan is amplified by local heating and winds, yet suppressed by both local and remote moisture inputs and sensible heat flux anomalies. PCA further supports these findings, linking the Tianshan's July increases to reduced net longwave cooling, stronger sensible heating, and lower atmospheric pressure, and the Taklamakan's August decreases to enhanced cooling, weakened heating, and increased humidity. These results highlight the region's divergent CBLH responses to local forcing and cross-regional interactions, emphasizing that both warming-induced increases and moisture-driven declines must be considered in future regional climate assessments.",

      "description": "This study systematically examines the evolution and driving factors of embodied CO2 emission transfers in trade between Chinese provinces and ASEAN countries from 2002 to 2017. Employing a global multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model embedded with Chinese provincial data and structural decomposition analysis (SDA), we quantify the CO2 emissions embodied in exports (EEE) from 30 Chinese provinces to 10 ASEAN member countries. The analysis explores temporal trends, provincial and sectoral distribution, export routes, and driving forces. The key findings are as follows: (1) As China-ASEAN economic ties have strengthened, China’s EEE to ASEAN have shown a sustained upward trend, with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam being the primary recipients. Heavy industries such as electricity, metal smelting, non-metallic mineral products, and chemicals are the dominant sources of these embodied emissions. (2) Coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have consistently served as major contributors to EEE. However, the contribution from several inland provinces has increased in later periods, revealing a spatial pattern of “coastal dominance and inland indirect participation” in interprovincial carbon transfer. (3) The export routes have shifted from predominantly international circulation toward a coexistence of domestic and international dual circulation, indicating the growing resilience of China’s domestic market and supply chains under the “dual circulation” strategy. (4) The expansion of final demand in ASEAN countries is identified as the primary driver behind China’s increasing EEE, whereas reductions in carbon intensity and structural upgrading of exports have partially offset the growth in emissions. This study highlights the importance of holistically considering inter-provincial disparities in emission transfers and advocates for improving regional and sectoral coordination in carbon mitigation policies, aiming to facilitate a green transition in China–ASEAN trade relations.",

      "description": "Drought, a prolonged period of precipitation deficit, is one of the most significant hydro-meteorological hazards affecting agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems, and its impacts are becoming more pronounced under intensifying global climate extremes. This study investigates the temporal behavior and severity of droughts in the Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, India, using a 122-year record of monthly precipitation (1901-2022) analyzed through the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month timescales. Statistical techniques were employed to assess drought frequency, duration, intensity, and long-term variability, alongside evaluations of linear trends and decadal oscillations linked to large-scale monsoon dynamics. The analysis identified 46 moderate to severe drought events at the 3-month scale and 32 at the 12-month scale, with the longest drought lasting 21 months between 2000 and 2002. The frequency of extreme drought events increased notably after the 1970s, coinciding with enhanced inter-annual variability in monsoon rainfall. While the long-term linear trends in drought severity were not statistically significant, the 12-month SPI exhibited clear decadal-scale oscillations influenced by monsoon behavior, and the 3-month SPI effectively captured short-term agricultural droughts affecting seasonal crop yields. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of drought characteristics in a highly vulnerable arid region and offer a quantitative basis for improving drought monitoring and early-warning systems. The results have direct implications for agricultural planning, irrigation scheduling, and the development of climate-informed contingency measures tailored to high-risk periods. By situating local drought assessment within the wider context of global climate extremes, this study highlights the need for integrated water resource management and region-specific policy interventions to strengthen resilience and support sustainable development in the face of an increasingly uncertain climate future.",

As regional disparities significantly influence national climate strategies, a detailed provincial-level analysis is essential for effective policy-making.MethodsWe integrate spatial autocorrelation analysis, spatio-temporal geographically weighted regression (GTWR/SGTWR), and agglomerative hierarchical clustering with dynamic time warping (DTW-AHC) to capture both spatial and temporal heterogeneities in emission patterns.ResultsThe findings reveal that provincial CO2 emissions exhibit weakening spatial aggregation after 2015, with northern provinces maintaining higher carbon intensity due to heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Energy consumption and transportation collectively account for over 70% of emissions growth after 2008, while emissions from food and water sectors decline after 2016, largely driven by technological advances. Four distinct emission clusters are identified: Rapid Growth, Resource-Dependent, Typical Growth, and Low-Carbon Exemplar.DiscussionTailored decarbonization strategies are proposed for each cluster: integrating renewable energy corridors with urban green infrastructure for Rapid Growth provinces; prioritizing ecological restoration and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) in Resource-Dependent regions; accelerating green industrial transitions in Typical Growth provinces; and reinforcing existing low-carbon policies for Exemplar provinces.

      "description": "Critical infrastructure (CI), such as healthcare facilities, schools, and the road network, plays a vital role in society by providing essential services that sustain the functioning of communities. Disruptions to this infrastructure can have profound consequences, affecting public health, safety, economic activities, and general well-being. Weather extremes, including tropical cyclones (TCs), are major drivers of such disruptions, causing widespread failures to power, communication, transportation, and healthcare. Forecasting the potential impact of weather events on these services in the weeks to days before landfall is crucial to enhance preparedness and enable effective anticipatory actions. Unlike previous efforts that focused primarily on estimating the potentially affected population, this research shifts attention to evaluating direct and indirect impacts on CI, and to capture the uncertain nature of impact forecasts depending on lead-time. The methodology, which relies entirely on open-source code and data, yields several metrics quantifying the impact of ensemble-based tropical cyclone (TC) wind forecasts on healthcare access, including the number of hospitals directly affected and the number of people indirectly affected due to disrupted access to healthcare facilities. We apply this approach to TCs Idai, Kenneth, and Freddy, which have struck Mozambique since 2019. The results highlight the extent of indirect effects on the population from infrastructure disruptions. Uncertainty arises from lead time, disruption threshold assumptions, and the challenge of capturing impact magnitude, especially for rapidly intensifying TCs. These findings underscore the importance of including indirect impacts into Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF) frameworks, which could enhance decision making. This research aligns with the development of IBF and situational awareness mechanisms promoted by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Building on this, the work supports international organizations in activating early warning protocols and delivering more targeted aid, such as financial resources, blankets, medical supplies, and volunteer personnel by identifying where hospitals are likely to be disrupted and which populations may lose access to healthcare. The visualizations generated further assist decision-makers in prioritizing areas that require immediate support.",

In the tropical Atlantic, the main EOF mode is the Equatorial Atlantic Mode (EAM), characterized by basin-wide negative SST anomalies on 2 to 4 year cycles. The second Atlantic mode is the Positive Atlantic Dipole, distinguished by opposing SST anomalies in the northern and southern tropics, varying between 6 months and 1 year. Correlation analyses between these climate modes and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) show that Central El Niño strongly influences Amazon droughts year-round, especially in northern and central sub-basins like Japurá, Negro, Trombetas-Uatumã, and Paru-Jari. The impact of the Eastern El Niño is milder and spatially heterogeneous, with opposite effects particularly evident in the Upper Negro sub-basin. The cold phase of the EAM favors wetter rainy seasons but can induce moisture reduction during the transition to the dry season, especially when combined with other seasonal forcings. When the Positive Atlantic Dipole occurs in the rainy season, Japurá and Negro basins become wetter, but other sub-basins face moderate drought. This oceanic pattern promotes drier conditions, bringing forward the onset of the dry season in practically all sub-basins. Our results demonstrate that Pacific and Atlantic oceanic patterns play complementary roles, with Central El Niño driving widespread and prolonged droughts, while Atlantic modes modulate the of extreme events, often amplifying or attenuating the impacts depending on the sub-basin considered. This enhanced understanding of coupled ocean–atmosphere interactions is essential for improving climate prediction, water resource management, and adaptation strategies in the face of increasing hydroclimatic extremes in the Amazon Basin.",

      "description": "Coastal areas drive much of the world's tourism growth, yet they are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the tourism sector, as environmental degradation can diminish the appeal of destinations. The tourism sector's strong dependence on women's work exposes it to gendered impacts, as climate risks in coastal environments are not gender-neutral but affect women disproportionately. Despite the growing attention to climate change in tourism research, methodological limitations have often overlooked household and community scales, thereby underutilizing women's knowledge and lived experiences. This study addresses these gaps by using photovoice, a participatory method that enables participants to frame and articulate climate-related changes in their own terms, based on their lived experiences. The participants' photovoices revealed changes in natural resources and coastal infrastructure linked to the spaces where women's work takes place and upon which it depends. A feminist political ecology lens informs the interpretation of these results, suggesting that the growing uncertainty associated with climate change has blurred the boundaries of these spaces, which form the core of women's work in tourism, reshaping their roles in ways that reinforce subordination rather than promote equal participation in the ocean economy. Moreover, the photovoices reveal that economic and non-economic losses represent interconnected dimensions of the same processes of change. The interaction between climate change and tourism thus introduces multidimensional, gender-related vulnerabilities that extend beyond economic impacts to include implications for women's political agency and a sense of cultural pride. By focusing on women's experiences, this study enhances our understanding of gendered vulnerabilities in coastal tourism and provides insights for developing more inclusive practices that promote gender equity and diversity in marine environments.",

      "description": "Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face accelerating climate hazards that undermine agricultural productivity. Fiji’s sugarcane sector, which is central to rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings, is increasingly affected by floods, droughts, cyclones, irregular rainfall, and rising input costs. Assessing farm-level climate vulnerability is essential for guiding effective adaptation. A convergent mixed-methods design was applied, integrating surveys from 100 smallholder farmers, panel regression to estimate hazard-specific yield elasticities, and AI-assisted scenario modeling aligned with Asian Development Bank climate projections. Stratified sampling captured variation in farm size, location, and cooperative membership, and survey responses were cross-validated with production records to ensure reliability. Flood-related hazards showed the strongest negative association with multi-year yields (β = −0.49, p < 0.001), followed by irregular rainfall and drought effects. Flood impacts were most severe because water-logging, access disruption, and delayed harvesting weakened ratoons and reduced subsequent cycle yields. Socio-institutional constraints, including limited cooperative support, inadequate extension services, and low youth engagement, intensified vulnerability. Grassroots participation, modeled on South Korea’s Saemaul Undong, can strengthen local coordination and adoption of adaptive practices. AI-assisted scenarios provided validated projections and identified priority adaptation pathways. The findings indicate a hydrology-first risk profile in Fiji’s coastal sugarcane systems. Targeted water management and accelerated varietal upgrading are essential to sustaining productivity under increasing climatic extremes. Coordinated investments in drainage, stress-tolerant cultivars, and farmer–extension partnerships can narrow adaptation gaps and stabilize rural livelihoods. Although focused on Fiji, the analysis provides a transferable framework for estimating climate-induced yield elasticities and validating adaptation strategies in coastal smallholder cane systems across tropical Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The integrated empirical and AI-based methodology offers a replicable template for climate resilience assessment in tropical agriculture.",

      "description": "IntroductionClimate assemblies have gained attention as participatory governance instruments designed to address complex climate challenges through inclusive deliberation. However, despite their growing prominence, systematic approaches for assessing their performance and impact remain scarce. This study responds to that gap by proposing a structured evaluation framework to measure the deliberative effectiveness of climate assemblies within the broader context of democratic climate governance.MethodsAn iterative, multi-stakeholder design process guided the development of the framework. It drew upon best-practice reviews, stakeholder consultations, and collaborative workshops. The resulting structure integrates input, process, and outcome dimensions, each associated with two key objectives: policy legitimacy, rooted in inclusive and trusted participation, and policy effectiveness, reflected in the influence of assembly recommendations on climate policy. The framework was piloted in two European climate assemblies to test its applicability and robustness.ResultsThe pilot evaluations demonstrated that applying a systematic assessment framework enhanced transparency and accountability within deliberative processes. It enabled a clearer understanding of how well assemblies fulfilled their aims of inclusion, deliberative quality, and policy relevance. Findings also revealed that consistent evaluation helps identify design strengths and weaknesses, supporting more evidence-based improvements in future assemblies.DiscussionThe study shows that structured evaluation is not merely a reporting exercise but a mechanism to strengthen democratic legitimacy and practical effectiveness. By offering standardized criteria and measurable indicators, the framework assists policymakers, organizers, and researchers in assessing whether climate assemblies translate citizen participation into tangible climate action. It contributes a practical and theoretically grounded tool for advancing deliberative democratic practices in climate governance.",

      "description": "ObjectiveThis study aims to address the research gaps in understanding the connections between climate change and infectious diseases by integrating bibliometric analysis with epidemiological perspectives and systematically identifying research trends and thematic evolution in this field.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of literature published between January 2010 and April 2025, retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. Analytical methods included keyword co-occurrence mapping and cluster analysis using CiteSpace and VOSviewer.ResultsThe analysis revealed a steady increase in publication output, accompanied by a notable shift from single-disease studies to complex system assessments. Research patterns showed distinct thematic priorities: vector-borne diseases demonstrated significant growth after 2018; respiratory infections maintained consistent research attention, while enteric diseases received comparatively limited focus. These patterns reflect underlying socioeconomic disparities and regional climatic influences.ConclusionThis study underscores the need for more systematic research on the intersection of climate change and infectious diseases. Future work should develop multi-disease analytical frameworks, advance interdisciplinary methods integrating environmental and data sciences with public health, and strengthen global research networks by improving geographic coverage and data standardization. These efforts will enhance predictive capabilities and intervention strategies against climate-sensitive infectious diseases.",
