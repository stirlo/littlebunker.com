By using AI and satellite LiDAR imagery from NASA and ESA, researchers have found a faster, more accurate way to map forest biomass critical for tracking carbon. This innovative fusion of space tech and machine learning could revolutionize how we manage and preserve forests in a warming world.",

A sweeping international study has found that over half of the carbon gases released by rivers come from long-term, old carbon sources like deep soils and weathered rocks, not just recent organic matter. This surprising discovery suggests Earth s vegetation is playing an even bigger role in absorbing excess carbon to keep the climate in check.",

This universal rule applies across drastically different organisms and habitats from trees to dragonflies, oceans to forests. Scientists now believe environmental filtering shapes this global distribution, providing new tools to predict how life responds to climate change and biodiversity threats.",

A new study reveals that only twice in 60 million years did environmental shifts dramatically reorganize these systems once with a continental land bridge, and again with climate-driven habitat change. Yet the ecosystems adapted, with new species taking on old roles. Now, a third, human-driven tipping point threatens that ancient resilience.",

Now, groundbreaking experiments by ETH Zurich have finally revealed that solid rock flows at extreme depths, acting like liquid in motion. This horizontal mantle flow aligns mineral crystals called post-perovskite in a single direction, explaining the seismic behavior. It s a stunning leap in understanding Earth s deep inner mechanics, transforming a long-standing mystery into a vivid map of subterranean currents that power volcanoes, earthquakes, and even the magnetic field.",
