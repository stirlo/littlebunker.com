      "description": "The Dead Sea isn’t just the saltiest body of water on Earth—it’s a living laboratory for the formation of giant underground salt deposits. Researchers are unraveling how evaporation, temperature shifts, and unusual mixing patterns lead to phenomena like “salt snow,” which falls in summer as well as winter. These processes mirror what happened millions of years ago in the Mediterranean, leaving behind thick salt layers still buried today.",

Scientists warn that if annual launches surge to projected levels by 2030, ozone recovery—already not expected until mid-century—could be delayed for decades.",

This shutdown would drastically reduce heat transport northward, leaving Europe vulnerable to extreme winters, summers of drying, and shifts in tropical rainfall. Climate models show the tipping point is linked to collapsing winter convection in the North Atlantic, which weakens vertical mixing and creates a feedback loop that accelerates decline.",
