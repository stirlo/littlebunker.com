Today, more than 300 million people — one in four Africans — are hungry and if current trends persist, the continent will account for over <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/ea9cebff-306c-49b7-8865-2aef3bfd25e2\">60% of the world’s hungry</a> by 2030.</p><p>In Kenya, at least a quarter of the population faces severe food insecurity, even as up to <a href=\"https://www.technoserve.org/blog/reducing-food-loss-and-waste/\">40%</a> of the food produced (worth an estimated $578 million) is lost or wasted each year. This not only squanders scarce resources such as land, water, labor and energy but also fuels climate change, contributing to 21% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>While often discussed together, food loss and food waste are distinct: food loss occurs earlier in the supply chain — on farms or during handling, storage and transport — whereas food waste occurs later, at retail, in restaurants and in households.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1017\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"814\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"623\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"491\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"294\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Kenya's food loss and waste rate impacts.\" height=\"294\" src=\"https://www.wri.org/s3/files/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/turning-the-tap-on-ver-3_0.jpg?itok=ZURgIaq3\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Despite Kenya’s <a href=\"https://au.int/en/documents/20250109/kampala-caadp-declaration-building-resilient-and-sustainable-agrifood-systems\">commitment</a> to reducing food loss and waste, <a href=\"https://africa.wri.org/research/food-loss-and-waste-maize-potato-fresh-fruits-and-fish-value-chains-kenya\">WRI research</a> found that progress has been slow due to limited data, weak coordination and insufficient financing for scalable solutions.</p><h3>How Much and Where Do Losses and Waste Occur in Kenya?</h3><p>Food loss and waste happen in all value chains, but we focused on specific foods for their importance as staples to the Kenyan diet (maize, potato, banana), nutrient-rich sources (fruits and fish) and commercially significant commodities (mango and avocado).</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1341\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1073\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"822\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"647\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"387\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Maize, potato, fresh fruit and fish are key to Kenya's value chain.\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://www.wri.org/s3/files/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/turning-the-tap-on-ver-2-insights-3.jpg?itok=SjeZscSU\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Due to long, complex supply chains and limited tracking data, it is challenging to ascertain exact figures for food loss.

These include improved harvesting tools, appropriate fishing gear, drying technologies, insecticides, fruit fly traps, better storage facilities (e.g., hermetic bags, silos, light-diffused rooms), cold chains and decentralized processing for perishables. Process innovations also improve supply-chain efficiency by connecting farmers to reliable markets through aggregation, contract farming and traceability systems, which track foods from farm to table.</p><p>However, the adoption of new technologies depends on proper training for farmers and value chain actors. Traditional methods — such as long-used harvesting practices — are deeply ingrained, making farmers hesitant to change. Some technologies, such as hermetic grain storage bags, can significantly reduce losses but remain less affordable than widely used polypropylene bags.</p><p>Cold chain systems, while effective, are often ill-suited to small farmers. Process innovations, such as contract farming and warehouse receipt systems, also face low acceptance due to mistrust stemming from side-selling, past negative experiences, and weak enforcement. Similarly, small farm processing initiatives, though promising, struggle with high marketing costs and limited reach, making it hard to sustain operations at a commercial scale.</p><h3>Moving from Commitments to Action</h3><p>Despite Kenya’s commitment to reduce food loss and waste, as the country has signed on to multiple national and global sustainability targets, the country lacks a robust mechanism for monitoring it, which hinders efforts to understand its scale, underlying causes and effective solutions. This gap presents a major bottleneck in identifying priorities and implementing targeted interventions.</p><p>Here are three key strategies that can help Kenya and other African countries reduce food loss and waste:</p><h4>1) Strengthen Measurement of Food Loss and Waste Magnitudes, Hotspots and Causes</h4><p>Like many countries, Kenya lacks disaggregated data on where losses happen and why. What gets measured gets managed. Without accurate data, it is challenging to establish national targets, implement effective interventions and measure progress. Developing a standardized system for tracking food loss and waste across the value chains is critical. This includes investing in data collection tools, training stakeholders, and integrating food loss and waste metrics into national agricultural and food systems reporting. WRI and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are designing practical tools to measure and report food loss and waste in ways that reflect on-the-ground realities — small, scattered farms, seasonal harvests and complex supply chains. For Kenya and other African countries, these tools could be game changers in the fight against hunger, food loss and food waste.</p><h4>2) Scaling Investment in Proven Food Loss and Waste Solutions and Practices</h4><p>WRI’s research demonstrates that many proven technologies and practices exist to reduce food loss and waste in the selected value chains. However, without greater awareness and sufficient financing, most of these solutions remain small-scale and underused. Building capacity in areas such as pre-harvest checks, harvesting methods, drying, storage, hygiene, transport and aggregation is critical, and successful models — like maize cob-and-grain business hubs — should be scaled up.</p><p>Lessons from export value chains, including contract farming, farmer aggregation and cold storage, can also be adapted for domestic markets. At the consumer level, public education campaigns, school programs and retailer partnerships can help shift habits. Encouraging portion control, proper food storage and redistributing surplus food are practical steps to cut waste at the household and retail levels.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099052824071019276/pdf/P181386143335e00c1851319e495ead16ea.pdf\">World Bank</a> estimates it will take $30 billion to $50 billion to halve food loss and waste by 2030, yet by 2020, only <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/landscape-of-climate-finance-for-agrifood-systems.pdf\">$1.1 billion</a> had been invested. Closing this gap demands bold public–private partnerships and sustained financing — from seed to long-term capital — to deliver farm-to-fork reductions, save resources and cut emissions. At the same time, food loss and waste solutions, such as cold chains, reliable energy and improved handling, must be tested for real-world fit, affordability and trade-offs to ensure they are effective in local contexts.</p><h4>3) Advance Policy and Coordination</h4><p>Kenya needs holistic food strategies that move beyond sectoral approaches to systemic solutions, with food loss and waste at the center. Policy shifts must be evidence-based — grounded in accurate measurement of FLW across supply chains, an understanding of local drivers, and clear cost–benefit analysis of interventions, including potential trade-offs. Supportive policies for food donation and redistribution are also critical. To deliver impact, Kenya should strengthen implementation of its <a href=\"https://kilimo.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/KENYA-POST-HARVEST-MANAGEMENT-ON-FOOD-LOSS-AND-WASTE-REDUCTION-STRATEGY.pdf\">National Strategy on Postharvest Loss and Waste</a> by operationalizing a national food loss and waste committee with clear mandates, county-level links and a dedicated budget, while also mainstreaming food loss and waste into its <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined commitments</a> and sector plans as a lever for food security and climate action.</p>",

They, and many smaller ports including <a href=\"https://gh2namibia.com/h2-projects/\">Walvis Bay in Namibia</a>, have begun to pilot the production of green hydrogen.</p><h3>4 Key Benefits of Decarbonizing Ports</h3><p>Port decarbonization can provide a quadruple win, providing effective options for climate change mitigation, economic opportunity, improved human health and ocean ecosystem benefits:</p><h4>1) A Powerful Force Against Climate Change</h4><p>The decarbonization of shipping and ports is one of the most <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/27fecd71f2d1cb8ffe8cbeec27fbba50/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2031968\">actionable and achievable</a> opportunities to support the development of a sustainable ocean economy today while mitigating the impacts of climate change. <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/ocean-solutions-to-climate-change/\">Research indicates</a> that action across seven ocean economy sectors can provide over 35% of the emissions reductions required by 2050 to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Of these sectors, decarbonizing shipping and ports can mitigate 2 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in emissions reductions by 2050 — that’s equivalent to more than <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/fourth-imo-greenhouse-gas-study-2020.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20Annual%20carbon%20intensity%20performance%20of,estimated%2C%20especially%20for%20container%20ships.\">3% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>, or taking around 430 million gas-fueled cars off the road every year.</p><h4>2) More Economic and Job Opportunities </h4><p>Decarbonizing ports can <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/a-sustainable-ocean-economy-for-2050-approximating-its-benefits-and-costs/\">generate </a>new economic opportunities, greater security in the energy and food sectors, and enhance stable global trade connectivity and partnerships.  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the ocean economy <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2025/03/the-ocean-economy-to-2050_e3f6a132.html\">has doubled</a> since 1995, growing at an average rate of 2.8% per year globally. The same research also concludes that a sustainable global ocean economy will continue to grow — tripling in production by 2050, relative to 2020. Considering employment as a metric, the decarbonization of ports and shipping could <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/ocean-employment/\">support 13.3 million additional jobs in 2050</a> — including shipbuilding, renewable and alternative fuel production, vessel and port facility retrofitting, shipbreaking, electrical work and more — relative to a business-as-usual scenario.   </p><h4>3) Better Health Outcomes for Communities</h4><p>There are clear benefits to human health from port decarbonization. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-021-09145-4\">Vessels currently running on heavy fuel oil</a> emit toxic air pollution that includes particulate matter, black carbon, nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Decarbonizing vessels, when scaled to ports globally, could help to avoid <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512201787X\">as many as 265,000 premature deaths</a> globally each year. Air quality improvements will benefit not only port workers, but also those communities living in proximity to ports, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/risa.13697\">many of which are disadvantaged</a> relative to other city neighborhoods.

Specifically, port planning needs to be paired with climate action plans and integrate terminal operators, logistics companies and local residents. As shipping is already a natural global connector, communication and coordination between cities and other ports will ensure that successes can scale widely.</p><h4>Cities Are Key to Port Decarbonization</h4><p>As seen from some of the early mover examples, <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/pressbriefings/pages/imo-approves-netzero-regulations.aspx\">high-level intergovernmental efforts</a> to drive sector decarbonization requires city-level leadership for implementation. Cities are hubs of economic activity, and their administrations have influence over the businesses and developments within their limits.</p><p>To date, city leaders have played a key role as enablers and advocates for the <a href=\"https://resilientcitiesnetwork.org/climate-resilient-cities/\">rapid development of climate resilience</a>. Decarbonizing ports provides further opportunities to promote sustainable growth and investment while mitigating climate change and boosting energy security <a href=\"https://www.lrfoundation.org.uk/news/unlocking-growth-how-tomorrows-ports-can-boost-economies-create-jobs-and-protect-nature#:~:text=Ports%20must%20balance%20economic%20growth,sustainable%20future%20for%20global%20trade.\">and trade connectivity</a>.</p><h4>Private Sector Involvement is Crucial</h4><p>The private sector has begun to set corporate targets and invest in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/how-to-decarbonize-international-shipping\">low-carbon fuel and vessel innovations</a>.

Specific steps include: </p><ol><li><strong>Naming port decarbonization as key</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>carbon neutrality</strong>. Many cities have announced reduced or net-zero emissions goals to combat climate change. Ports can be elevated as a priority to address significant emissions while improving public health.</li><li><strong>Setting ambitious mid- and long-term targets</strong> for emissions reductions at the city-level would create momentum and accountability regardless of stalled national or international progress.</li><li><strong>Translating clean technology deployments in other sectors to ports </strong>including leveraging lessons and infrastructure from land transport electrification. The rapidly growing electric vehicle segment offers innovative approaches in shipping and goods movement.</li><li><strong>Promoting exchanges </strong>between cities and ports to create transparency around data, progress, and technical learnings while launching breakthrough collaborations like new green shipping corridors between cities and ports or aligning on a common clean fuel source.</li></ol><p>This type of approach that leverages ambitious climate goals with cross-sector and global collaboration has been effective in signaling change in other industries. For example, the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\">Ocean Panel</a> set targets and common goals between diverse nations to protect the ocean. Electric transit buses and <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org\">school buses</a> gained momentum using a systems-wide approach that engaged fleets, communities, energy providers, manufacturers and policymakers.</p><p>Now, more than ever, ambitious climate action is necessary across the transportation sector and beyond. Ports present an opportunity to not only bolster climate action but also provide clear wins for human and ocean health while supporting global and local economies and sustainable growth.</p><p>At a time when geopolitical shifts and a changing global economic outlook are stalling national climate ambitions and commitments, putting sustainable development at risk, decarbonizing ports offers a scalable and actionable opportunity to tackle climate change, address health risks and promote sustainable development.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Recent studies indicate that the world will need $10 trillion annually between 2030 and 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. That’s a lot — but the world has the money.</p><p>As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf\">IPCC</a>) explains, “there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gaps ... but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action.” The challenge, then, is not necessarily raising additional finance for climate change mitigation and adaptation, but how to align all of the world’s capital toward climate action.</p><p>Article 2.1(c) of the international Paris Agreement on climate change aims to do just that by “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate-resilient development.” However, the language of Article 2.1(c) is vague on what exactly it entails. Ten years after virtually all countries adopted the Paris Agreement, they’re still at odds over the scope of Article 2.1(c) and how it should be implemented.</p><p>Here, we explain what Article 2.1(c) is, how it interacts with other finance mandates, and what’s needed to put it into action.</p><h3>What Does Article 2.1(c) Do? </h3><p>The heart of the Paris Agreement on climate change is Article 2, which sets the objectives of the agreement. Article 2.1(a) urges a global response to hold the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Article 2.1(b) outlines the need to adapt to adverse impacts of climate change, build resilience and pursue low-greenhouse gas development. Article 2.1(c) points out that we need to make finance flows consistent with these objectives if we’re ever going to attain them. Finally, Article 2.2 outlines the context these articles should be pursued under, including the principles of equity, common-but-differentiated responsibility, and respective capabilities and national circumstances.</p><p>2.1(c) is a holistic goal. That means it covers both mitigation and adaptation, potentially encompassing domestic and international finance flows. It requires not just scaling up the good finance — for example, climate resilience bonds and financing for new renewable energy projects — but also scaling down funding to carbon-intensive activities, like new coal plants or diesel truck fleets. And it doesn’t stop with government spending. Depending on how it’s interpreted, it could also encompass the private sector, including financial institutions, businesses, corporations and investors.</p><p>In short, financial systems broadly must align with the pursuit of sustainable development and international climate goals. This means that all types of investments and financing activities — all investors and actors in the real economy, stock as well as flows — should be “consistent” with achieving the world’s climate goals.</p><p>2.1(c) will require economic and financial reform. The tools (e.g., policies and economic and financial instruments) for getting there will be many and varied. Innovative policies and financial instruments will surely play a role, such as green procurement (where companies and governments would be required to decarbonize supply chains) and climate-related bonds to integrate climate priorities into economic development plans.</p><p>And in order to ensure equity, alignment of financial flows will have to be customized to each country’s economic, financial and social contexts. This especially includes developing countries’ pursuit of sustainable development, poverty eradication and a just transition.</p><h3>What Progress Has Been Made Toward Achieving Article 2.1(c)? </h3><p>Though a common understanding of 2.1(c) has yet to be agreed upon by Paris Agreement signatories, efforts inside and outside the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are providing glimpses of what alignment could look like.</p><h4>Efforts Within UNFCCC</h4><p>Article 2.1(c) has been surfaced in several different forums within the UNFCCC over the past several years. These include the UN’s <strong>Global Stocktake</strong>, which concluded at the 2023 <u>UN climate summit (COP28) and</u> assessed progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement, including Article 2.1(c), for the first time. In its <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/explaining-global-stocktake-paris-agreement\">key findings</a>, it recognized that financial flows include “international and domestic, public and private.”</p><p>In 2022 at COP27, negotiators established the <strong>Sharm el-Sheikh (SeS) dialogue</strong> on Article 2.1(c). This brought together countries, organizations and other stakeholders to exchange views and deepen the understanding of Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement and its complementarity with Article 9.</p><p>Between 2023 and 2025, six SeS dialogues were held, covering key topics including defining the scope of Article 2.1(c), identifying intended and unintended consequences of climate finance, methodologies for tracking financial flows, capacity building for the financial sector and more.</p><p>The<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/funds-entities-bodies/standing-committee-on-finance/about-the-standing-committee-on-finance\"><strong>Standing Committee on Finance</strong></a><strong> </strong>(SCF), established during COP16, has two tasks related to Article 2.1(c): mapping information that contributes to the implementation of Article 2.1(c) and preparing a <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/632307\">synthesis report</a> (published in November 2023) analyzing how to operationalize it. The SCF provided a first report at COP27 and an updated <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/632307\">report</a> at COP28 for countries’ consideration.</p><h4>Efforts Outside UNFCCC</h4><p>Stakeholders like investors and corporations have developed frameworks to identify progress in aligning financing per Article 2.1(c). For example, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/making-finance-consistent-climate-goals\">WRI</a> developed a framework and identified tools governments already have at their disposal to shift and mobilize finance. Tools are available in four categories: financial policies and regulations, fiscal policy levers, public finance and information instruments.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1073\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"922\" />\n              <source height=\"1073\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"922\" />\n              <source height=\"1073\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"922\" />\n              <source height=\"884\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"530\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Government tools to shift and mobilize finance\" height=\"530\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2023-11/figure-government-tools-shift-finance-paris-agreement.png?VersionId=pc_J3sDyRTWJY2yEQgAMOpQomyCkFVEo&itok=iXMlqdSN\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Investors, corporations and financial institutions have also shown some progress on Article 2.1(c) alignment.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p><strong>Paying for the Paris Agreement Resource Hub</strong></p><p>WRI's Paying for Paris <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/paying-for-paris\" target=\"_blank\">resource hub</a> highlights different tools to make progress toward 2.1(c).

Some countries argue that “consistency of financial flows” is about directing finance to green, sustainable and/or climate-related activities, regardless of the financial instruments through which such flows are channeled. The <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf\">IPCC</a> has defined it more broadly as looking at all investments, whether or not they contribute to climate objectives, including those investments that play a transition role.</p><p>However, “consistency” will require some conversation about what <em>not</em> to do, as well. At the very least, countries need to come to a common understanding on how to scale down misaligned investments (like financing fossil fuels) and the impact this may have on countries’ domestic policies and national development.</p><h4>Concerns About Unintended Consequences</h4><p>Countries have different development pathways, needs and priorities. Policies and instruments to align their financial flows will need to account for this diversity. However, because 2.1(c) is a global effort, questions will arise about standards for action and whether similar policies and regulations need to be applied in all countries. For example, if one developing country does not reform a specific set of policies, will it no longer be eligible to access climate finance? Will there be trade restrictions imposed on specific products?</p><h4>The Relationship of Article 2.1(c) to Other Global Finance Goals</h4><p>Article 2.1(c) is just one goal within the Paris Agreement for addressing climate change. To effectively operationalize it, it must be considered within the context of the whole agreement — especially its other finance goals.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">COP30 Resource Hub</p><p class=\"secondary\">WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. Watch our <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>For example, negotiators and other stakeholders like research organizations and academic institutions are examining the complementarity of Article 2.1(c) and the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/NCQG\">new collective quantified goal (NCQG)</a>. Agreed to at COP29 in Baku, the NCQG is a new finance objective that goes beyond developed nations’ goal of providing a collective $100 billion in climate finance annually. However, while Article 2.1(c) refers to <em>all </em>financial flows for countries that signed the Paris Agreement, the NCQG is specific to finance that supports developing countries.</p><p>Importantly, the mandate to adopt the NCQG states that the new goal must consider developing countries’ needs and priorities. Developing countries have reiterated their concern that Article 2.1(c) discussions could draw the NCQG conversations away from this focus and toward domestic policy and finance flow <a href=\"https://odi.org/en/publications/options-for-embedding-article-21c-in-the-new-collective-quantified-goal-on-climate-finance/\">shifts</a>, or lead to conditionalities or barriers to access financial support.</p><p>Through the adoption of the NCQG, negotiators reaffirmed its purpose of accelerating progress toward the achievement of Article 2 of the Paris Agreement. But questions remain over how exactly this contribution will be measured and counted toward the NCQG.</p><h3>What to Watch at Future COPs</h3><p>Article 2.1(c) was addressed on several fronts at previous COPs, including as part of the Global Stocktake, in reports prepared by the SCF and in outcomes of the Sharm el-Sheikh dialogue.</p><p>At COP28, developed countries suggested an agenda item focused on Article 2.1 (c), as well as a dedicated work program within the UNFCCC. Developing countries, however, expressed skepticism about this approach, on the basis that a focus on 2.1(c) could “lead to developed countries shying away from their commitments and obligations” to provide financial support to vulnerable nations. This concern was also expressed the year before at COP27.</p><p>There will be no way to meet global climate goals if countries can’t agree on how to steer finance toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient world. Investment is both the fuel and the steering wheel for arriving where we need to go. Article 2.1(c) will be complicated to operationalize, but in its very ambition, it provides a vision for the road forward.</p><p>At COP30 in 2025, it will be essential to establish both a mandate to develop the Article 2.1(c) framework as well as a roadmap for its development. Such a framework could be used as guidance for countries, covering key elements such as transparency, quality, enablers and disablers, as well as ways to transform the global financial architecture. The roadmap on the other hand should include structured dialogues or alternative formats that ensure the framework is both effectively designed and successfully implemented.</p><p><em>This article was originally published on Nov. 22,2023.

      "description": "<p><strong>JAKARTA (October 30, 2025)</strong> –<strong> </strong>Ahead of COP30, Indonesia has recently submitted its new <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-10/Indonesia_Second%20NDC_2025.10.24.pdf\">nationally determined contribution</a> (NDC), projecting that emissions will peak by 2030 and then decline to 1.26 and 1.49 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 under two economic growth scenarios. <br /><br /><strong>Following is a statement from Nirarta \"Koni\" Samadhi, Country Director, WRI Indonesia:</strong></p><p>“Indonesia’s new climate plan marks an important step forward, building on earlier commitments with an absolute target to reduce emissions by 2035. It strengthens transparency and accountability, and signals the country's commitment to tackling climate change. The plan also rightly recognizes the need to prepare for worsening climate impacts, while supporting workers through a just transition.” <br /><br />“The emissions reduction scenarios in the NDC are a welcome step, but both pathways show slower reductions through 2035, meaning steeper cuts will be needed after 2035 to stay on track for net-zero by 2060 or earlier.</p><p>“Bright spots in the plan include expanded coverage of potent greenhouse gases such as hydrofluorocarbons and new forestry and land use measures, including the use of harvested wood products, blue carbon initiatives such as mangroves and seagrass, and ambitious 2030 targets to restore millions of hectares of degraded land. It also aims to improve reforestation accounting through enhanced monitoring, reporting, and verification, while accelerating the energy transition with a target of 70–72% renewable energy in the national supply by 2060.</p><p>“Still, there is room for improvement. Greater clarity on the 2019 emissions baseline – currently reported with varying figures in its UN biennial update report – would make progress easier to track and increase transparency. It is also essential to align national plans with other key frameworks, including the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) Comprehensive Investment Plan and Policy (CIPP) and the National Energy Policy (NEP), which show there’s room to be even more ambitious.  </p><p>“Recent WRI analysis finds that <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition\">aligning the NEP with the JETP CIPP scenario</a> would reduce greenhouse gas emissions while delivering socio-economic benefits, including better health outcomes, increased investment and job creation – ultimately boosting economic growth. Indonesia's Just Transition approach is currently limited to workers, with less attention to communities and regional economic losses. A broader, more inclusive approach is needed across all climate action efforts, covering both mitigation and adaptation.” </p>",

      "description": "<p>Addis Ababa University’s (AAU) Department of Economics, in collaboration with WRI, has successfully completed two phases of the Research Hub Program on systems thinking and green economic modeling. Supported through WRI’s National Climate Action (NCA) initiative, the program is building a strong foundation for Ethiopia’s next generation of climate and economic modelers.</p><p>Over the past two years, this partnership has advanced AAU’s pioneering work in green-economy modeling and systems thinking. WRI worked closely with the university to develop a cutting-edge curriculum and train academic staff in system dynamics, equipping educators and researchers with tools to tackle Ethiopia’s complex climate and economic challenges.</p><p>So far, 10 master’s students have received full scholarships to specialize in applied economic modeling relevant to policy and planning. Their research explores themes such as green employment, agricultural productivity, sustainable transport and urban waste management. They also received professional training alongside practitioners from key government institutions and participated in a series of academic seminars. These efforts are not only building expertise but also bridging the gap between policy and research.  </p><p>This initiative marks a significant step forward in embedding analytical and modeling capacity within Ethiopia’s higher education system to support national climate goals. By introducing the Green Economy Model into academic curriculum and applied research, AAU and WRI are equipping the country with stronger tools to design, assess and implement climate-resilient, low-carbon development strategies.</p><p>The Research Hub has evolved into a national and regional center of excellence, bridging research, policy and practice. It is empowering a new generation of economists and climate analysts to work with the Ministry of Planning and Development (MoPD), the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and other institutions to implement Ethiopia’s 2050 net-zero vision. This collaboration underscores the transformative role universities can play in shaping national climate governance when research and policy are aligned.</p><p>Through WRI’s partnership, AAU implemented a program that strengthened academic and professional skills in systems thinking and green economic modeling.</p><p>Practitioners from MoPD, EPA and the Ministry of Finance joined the program’s advanced system dynamics training sessions, designed to improve cross-institutional collaboration and analytical and policy modeling skills.</p><p>Through guest lectures and seminars, the Research Hub built a vibrant learning community of students, faculty and policymakers to explore how modeling can inform climate policy. Graduates presented their findings at a seminar hosted by WRI Ethiopia, receiving technical feedback from experts across different sectors. Building on this momentum, the AAU team presented the partnership at the second <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/africa-climate-summit-2025-needed-outcomes\">African Climate Summit</a> as an example of how academic research can shape national and regional climate strategies. These engagements showcased the students’ achievements and reinforced AAU and WRI’s reputation as leaders in applied modeling for sustainable development.</p><p>The AAU-WRI Research Hub demonstrates how long-term collaboration can strengthen institutional capacity and support evidence-based policymaking. It shows the key role local universities can play in generating data and research that directly guide government planning. By training people in modeling and analysis, the project helps ensure Ethiopia’s development decisions are based on sound evidence and measurable outcomes.</p><p>As Dr. Mengesha, head of the economics department at AAU, noted, <em>“This collaboration has not only trained experts, but it has also established a long-term foundation for climate modeling that will continue to serve Ethiopia’s policy processes for years to come.”</em> This comment captures the essence of the project — capacity building, knowledge generation and sustainable impact.</p><h3>What’s Next?</h3><p>Building on these achievements, WRI and AAU aim to expand the Research Hub’s curriculum by introducing new modeling modules and aligning it with Ethiopia’s emerging Climate Data Hub — a tracking and monitoring system that feeds directly into Green Economy Model projections. The next phase will focus on developing a new group of master’s and doctoral researchers, strengthening the hub’s role as center for learning and innovation, and deepening collaboration between universities and government institutions.</p><p>The upcoming work will also prioritize producing high-quality, policy-relevant research and improving access to data-driven tools for climate planning. Through the continued partnership, AAU and WRI aim to strengthen Ethiopia’s modeling and analytical capacity to better support the country's development goals.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><em>If you are interested in partnering with Addis Ababa University and WRI to build on and expand this work, please contact </em><a href=\"mailto:sara.ascher@wri.org\">sara.ascher@wri.org</a><em>.</em></p>",

This analysis incorporates submissions through Sept. 30, 2025. View <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">WRI's Climate Watch NDC tracker</a> to explore the latest.</p></div><p>2025 is a pivotal moment for climate action. Countries are submitting new national climate commitments, known as \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined contributions</a>\" or \"NDCs,\" that will shape the trajectory of global climate progress through 2035.</p><p>These new commitments will show how boldly countries plan to cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; transform their economies; and strengthen resilience to growing threats, like extreme weather, wildfires and floods. Together, they will determine how far the world goes toward limiting global temperature rise and avoiding the worst climate impacts.</p><p>Over 60 countries — including some major emitters, such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and the U.K. — have already put forward new NDCs. These represent an improvement from previous commitments, and many smaller and developing nations are leading the way with <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/allied-climate-transformation-act2025/resources/g20-learn-ndcs-climate-vulnerable-nations\">stronger targets</a>. Yet collective ambition <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-un-report-finds-country-climate-commitments-falling-short\">still falls short</a> of what's needed to keep the world within critical warming thresholds, according to a recent <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/the-direction-of-travel-improving-every-year-but-we-need-to-urgently-pick-up-the-pace-un-climate\">NDC Synthesis Report from the UN</a>.</p><p>This is not the complete picture: Countries representing nearly 70% of global emissions have yet to submit their NDCs and are expected to do so by the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">2025 UN climate summit (COP30)</a> this November. But the current NDCs do give us an idea of where progress is headed.</p><p>We analyzed the submissions thus far for a snapshot of how countries' climate plans are shaping up and what they reveal about the road ahead.</p><h3>How Many Countries Have Submitted New NDCs?</h3><p>Under the Paris Agreement, 2025 NDCs were technically due in February. As of Sept. 30, <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">61 countries</a>, covering 31% of the world's emissions, had submitted them.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\"><strong>About the 2025 NDCs</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">NDCs are critical to halting climate change. They lay out how each country will contribute to global goals outlined under the Paris Agreement, including emissions cuts needed to keep temperature rise below 1.5-2 degrees C (2.7-3.6 degrees F). 2025 marks the third round of NDCs since the treaty's inception in 2015, with countries setting climate targets through 2035. These plans are expected to reflect the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake/about-the-global-stocktake/outcome-of-the-first-global-stocktake\">2023 Global Stocktake</a> — the first full review of global climate progress — which called for deeper emissions cuts and faster action on fossil fuels, renewables, transport and forests, and adaptation and resilience. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">Learn more.</a></p></div><p>Among the G20 — the world's largest GHG emitters — seven have put forth new NDCs: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. (The U.S. has since announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, effective January 2026, though its NDC remains officially listed with the UNFCCC.) Others, including China, the EU and Turkey, announced top-line emissions targets but have yet to submit official NDCs.</p><p>Many more countries have also stepped forward, including Chile, Ecuador and Uruguay in Latin America; Kenya, Ethiopia and Nigeria in Africa; and island states such as Singapore, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives.</p><p>Most of the remaining countries are expected to present their new NDCs by the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">UN Climate Conference (COP30)</a> in November.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25685330/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>How Much Have 2025 NDCs Reduced the Emissions Gap?</h3><p>Compared to previous 2030 targets, the NDCs submitted so far have made only a modest dent in the 2035 emissions gap: the difference between where emissions<em> need</em> to be to align with 1.5 degrees C and where they're <em>expected</em> to be under countries' climate plans.</p><p>If fully implemented, new \"unconditional NDCs\" (those that don't require international support) are projected to reduce emissions by an additional 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. This leaves an emissions gap of 29.9 GtCO2e to hold warming to 1.5 degrees C. When \"conditional NDCs\" (those that do require international support) are included, the projected emissions reductions rise to 1.6 GtCO2e, leaving a gap of 26.6 GtCO2e.</p><p><strong>In other words, the NDCs submitted so far achieve less than 6% of the additional emissions reductions needed by 2035 to close the gap to 1.5 degrees C.</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3335791/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Factoring in countries that have put forth emissions targets but not official NDCs (like China, the EU and Turkey) brings emissions down by an additional 1.3 GtCO2e by 2035. Even this is far from what's needed to keep warming within safe limits.</p><p>Still, many of the G20 countries — which together account for about half of global GHG emissions — have yet to submit. This raises the stakes for the upcoming NDCs. Ambitious commitments (particularly from the highest emitters) could narrow the emissions gap. Or, if their pledges fall short, they could leave the world locked into a trajectory that puts global temperature targets out of reach.</p><p><strong>Emissions-reduction targets put forward by major emitters so far:</strong></p><table class=\"table tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Previous 2030 Emissions-Reduction Target</th><th>New 2035 Emissions-Reduction Targets</th><th>Net-Zero Target Year</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Australia</td><td>43% from 2005 levels</td><td>62%-70% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>53.1% from 2005 levels</td><td>59%-67% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>40%-45% from 2005 levels</td><td>45%-50% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>46% from 2013 levels</td><td>60% from 2013 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Russian Federation</td><td>70% of 1990 levels</td><td>65%-67% of 1990 levels</td><td>2060</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>68% from 1990 levels</td><td>81% from 1990 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>50%-52% from 2005 levels</td><td>61%-66% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>China*</td><td>Over 65% carbon intensity reduction below 2005</td><td>7%-10% from peak</td><td>2060</td></tr><tr><td>European Union*</td><td>55% from 1990 levels</td><td>66.25%-72.5% from 1990 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey*</td><td>41% below BAU</td><td>Reach 643 MtCO2e</td><td>2053</td></tr></tbody></table><p><sup>*These countries have announced 2035 top-line emissions-reduction targets but had not yet submitted NDCs as of Sept. 30.</sup></p><h3>How Do Specific Countries' Climate Plans Stack Up?</h3><p>Among the countries that have submitted new NDCs so far, the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> stands out for its ambitious goal to cut emissions 81% from 1990 levels by 2035. This rapid decline in the coming decade would put the country on track to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-advice-on-the-uks-2035-nationally-determined-contribution-ndc/\">based on</a> realistic rates of technology deployment and ambitious but achievable shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p><p>Other countries, such as <strong>Japan</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong>, have opted for a \"linear\" approach toward net zero. This means if they drew a straight line to their net-zero target (for example, 0 GtCO2e in 2050), their 2030 and 2035 targets would fall along it, reflecting a constant decline in emissions each year. Japan aims to cut emissions 60% from 2013 levels by 2035, while the United States has pledged a 61%-66% reduction from 2005 levels by 2035. This linear approach — compared to earlier, steeper emissions cuts — can still achieve net zero by mid-century, but risks compromising global temperature targets by using more of the world's carbon budget sooner.</p><p>Despite the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and reversing many federal climate policies, its NDC may still guide climate action at the state, city and local levels. Many of these entities <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/press-releases/alliance-2035-target-dec-2024/?ref=csofutures.com\">have already rallied</a> around the new NDC and are committed to making progress toward its targets.</p><p><strong>Brazil </strong>presented a range of emissions targets in its NDC, committing to a 59%-67% reduction from 2005 levels by 2035. A 67% reduction could put Brazil on track for climate neutrality by 2050, while a 59% reduction falls short of that goal. It is unclear which target the government intends to pursue, leaving Brazil's true ambition in question. The NDC also omits carbon budgets for specific sectors (such as energy, transport or agriculture), which would clarify how it plans to meet its overarching emissions goals. However, Brazil <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2024-11/Brazil_Second%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20%28NDC%29_November2024.pdf\">committed</a> to develop these sectoral plans at a later date.</p><p><strong>Canada </strong>made only a marginal increase to its target, shifting from a 40%-45% emissions reduction by 2030 to 45%-50% by 2035 from 2005 levels. This falls short of the <a href=\"https://www.nzab2050.ca/news-insights/net-zero-advisory-body-responds-to-todays-announcement-of-canadas-greenhouse-gas-emissions-target-for-2035\">recommendation</a> from Canada's own Net-Zero Advisory Body, which called for a 50%-55% reduction by 2035 — and warned that anything below 50% risks derailing progress toward the country's legislated net-zero goal by 2050. Canada is also working to cut methane emissions by over 35% by 2030, including a 75% reduction from its oil and gas sector relative to 2012.</p><p>Among the major emitters that have put forward emissions targets but not NDCs, ambition is mixed. <strong>China </strong>announced that it aims to cut emissions 7%-10% from peak levels by 2035, though without specifying a baseline year. <strong>Turkey</strong> pledged to cut emissions to 643 million tonnes by 2035. And the <strong>European Union</strong> released a statement of intent pledging a 66.25%-72.5% reduction by 2035 from 1990 levels.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1189\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"951\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"728\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"574\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"343\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cyclists on a closed-off city street to allow for biking and walking.\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/brazil-sao-paulo-cyclists.jpg?VersionId=foGuCuISvtbdA3gTGD_qkoedW3FFd7M5&itok=F-sOdcK-\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, Brazil, is car-free on Sundays to allow for more pedestrians and cyclists. Tackling high-emitting sectors like transport is critical to halting climate change. Photo by William Rodrigues dos Santos/Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How Are High-Emitting Countries Addressing Key Areas like Energy, Forestry and Transport?</h3><p>Establishing specific targets and measures for high-emitting sectors like energy, forestry and transport is essential for driving progress on the ground. It signals to stakeholders across government, industry and finance where action and investment are most needed to meet climate goals. Such measures are especially important among G20 countries, which can shape global supply chains, set standards, and direct vast public and private capital toward low-carbon solutions.</p><p>As more G20 countries come forth with new NDCs, a clearer picture is emerging of how they are embedding sector-specific action into their climate commitments.</p><h4>Energy</h4><p>Only a few G20 countries have set clear renewable electricity targets. The U.K., for example, pledged to achieve at least 95% clean electricity by 2030. Australia committed to 82% renewables by the same year. Others, including Canada, Brazil and Russia, signaled plans to expand clean energy but without quantified targets. China's announcement pledged that, by 2035, it will raise the share of non-fossil fuels in domestic energy consumption to over 30% and increase wind and solar capacity sixfold from 2020 levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, progress on transitioning away from fossil fuels remains uneven. The U.K. has already phased out coal power and pledged to hold consultations on ending new oil and gas exploration licenses. Canada and Australia are working to end coal power by 2030 and 2040, respectively. Russia positioned natural gas as a transitional fuel, while Brazil encourages the replacement of fossil fuels by promoting sustainable biofuels and electrification.</p><p>But this is not enough: Much of the focus remains on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/countries-phasing-out-coal-power-fastest\">phasing out coal</a>, particularly among developed economies, while oil and gas receive less attention. Without clear, time-bound decline pathways for <em>all </em>fossil fuels, clean-energy growth alone may not cut absolute emissions fast enough to align with the Paris Agreement's goals.</p><h4>Transport</h4><p>Only two G20 countries include clear targets for zero-emission vehicles in their NDCs. The U.K. has adopted a mandate requiring 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans to be zero-emission by 2030, reaching 100% by 2035. Canada's Electric Vehicle Availability Standard requires 100% zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2035.</p><h4>Forestry</h4><p>Brazil has pledged to suppress illegal deforestation and scale restoration initiatives, with goals to recover millions of hectares of forest by 2030 and 2050. Canada and the United States have committed to protecting and conserving 30% of their land and waters by 2030, while Australia's Strategy for Nature 2024-2030 seeks to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by the same year. China has pledged to expand its forests significantly by 2035.</p><div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">Related</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">What Are NDCs and How Do They Address Climate Change?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">What Would Ambitious Climate Commitments Look Like for the World's Top Emitters?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/ndcs/sectoral-opportunities\">Learn More About How Countries Can Incorporate Sectoral Targets into NDCs</a></li></ul></div><h3>What Other Trends Are Emerging Among NDCs Submitted So Far?</h3><p>Several other trends are starting to emerge among the new NDCs. While submissions so far offer valuable insights, they don't yet reflect the full picture; deeper analysis will be needed as more NDCs come in by COP30 in November.</p><h4>1) Nearly all new NDCs include 2035 mitigation measures, with half setting economy-wide emissions-reduction targets.</h4><p>Almost all of the 61 NDCs submitted thus far — with the exceptions of Niue and Zambia — include new mitigation measures through 2035.</p><p>Most (56) express their 2035 targets as emissions-reduction goals. The exceptions are Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua, which instead included sectoral mitigation measures. Cuba, for example, committed to increase renewable electricity generation and improve energy efficiency by 2035.</p><p>Half of the countries with emissions-reduction goals set economy-wide targets covering <em>all </em>sectors <em>and </em>greenhouse gases (as encouraged by the 2023 Global Stocktake). Notably, China announced that its new top-line emissions target will for the first time cover all sectors and GHGs. This is an important step: China's previous NDCs covered only CO2, but the country's non-CO2 emissions alone place it among the world's top 10 emitters.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries are required to submit economy-wide targets, while developing countries are encouraged to work toward them over time.</p><h4>2) Most countries did not strengthen their 2030 targets.</h4><p>Despite clear scientific evidence and UN decisions urging stronger 2030 targets, only 14 (23%) of 61 countries have strengthened their 2030 emissions pledges. This includes Ethiopia, Saint Lucia, Nepal, Moldova, Jamaica and Montenegro, among others. For example, Montenegro revised its 2030 emissions-reduction target from 35% to 55% and set a 60% target by 2035, compared to 1990 levels.</p><p>Notably, none of the wealthier, high-emitting and more developed countries have strengthened their 2030 targets — despite having the greatest capacity and responsibility to take the lead on slashing emissions.</p><h4>3) Most countries have strengthened their adaptation measures.</h4><p>In the face of worsening climate impacts, 45 of 61 countries set stronger adaptation commitments in their new NDCs, continuing a trend seen in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/state-nationally-determined-contributions-2022\">previous rounds</a>. Many of these countries are prioritizing adaptation across sectors such as food and water systems, public health and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\">nature-based solutions</a>.</p><p>For example, Ecuador, which is particularly vulnerable to heavy rainfall and floods, prioritized action to build resilience of its water resources, human health and settlements, and natural heritage. Canada, which has witnessed devastating wildfires in recent years, cited its National Adaptation Strategy, which provides a framework for disaster resilience, biodiversity, public health and infrastructure.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Firefighters putting out flames along a highway.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/canaad-fire-fighters_0.jpg?VersionId=oDsXmUNOUA7kTI8Zc.sWJ1cA5GyZ_rB1&itok=KlqXVuzm\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Canadian firefighters in 2021.

This continues a trend seen in previous rounds, with the vast majority of reported finance needs consistently coming from developing countries.</p><p>Six, including Ecuador, Barbados and Tonga, reported finance needs for the first time in 2025, while 14 increased their estimates compared to previous NDCs. The largest increases came from Angola, whose needs jumped from $44 billion to $412 billion (with about 89% conditional on international support), and Pakistan, whose funding needs rose from $241 billion to $565 billion.</p><p>These numbers highlight the urgent need for scaled and predictable finance to support developing countries' climate goals. At the same time, total finance needs are likely underestimated, given that only about half of the 61 countries included cost data. This underscores the importance of enhanced transparency and support in climate finance planning.</p><h4>5) More and more countries are incorporating 'just transition' in their NDCs.</h4><p>Forty-four (72%) of the NDCs submitted so far explicitly mention a \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-is-just-transition-tracking-progress\">just transition,</a>\" representing a major increase from previous rounds. Crucially, more countries are now going beyond one-line references and expanding upon specific just transition efforts that are already underway or planned. Many, such as<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/what-just-transition-and-why-it-crucial-colombia\">Colombia</a>, Sri Lanka, Eswatini and the U.K., dedicate entire sections of their new NDCs to this concept.</p><p>Countries are also defining \"just transition\" more clearly and specifying where it is most relevant to their national climate action. Bangladesh and Brazil, for example, explicitly reference decent work and quality jobs. Countries like Moldova and the UAE reference the importance of skills and training to support workers and youth. While the energy sector remains the main focus for just transition discussions, some countries also incorporate areas such as water, agriculture, waste and climate adaptation.</p><h4>6) Countries are recognizing the importance of subnational action.</h4><p>Some countries' NDCs also recognize the critical role that subnational actors, such as cities, states and regions, play in shaping and delivering climate action.</p><p>More than 30 of the newly submitted NDCs come from countries that have endorsed the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP)</a>, and several mention it explicitly. The CHAMP initiative — launched in 2023 by the COP28 Presidency, in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies and with the support of WRI and other partners — aims to strengthen collaboration between national and subnational governments on climate planning and implementation. As part of this commitment, 77 countries pledged to consult with and integrate subnational priorities and needs into their NDCs.</p><p>Brazil, for example, highlights an instrument called \"climate federalism\" designed to support the integration of climate action into planning and decision-making across all levels of government. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-colombia-updates-its-climate-commitments-2035\">Colombia</a> acknowledged the role of <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-subnational-governments-are-shaping-colombias-next-generation-climate-commitments/\">subnational governments</a> in planning and implementing measures to both mitigate and adapt to climate change in its NDC.</p><h3>What's Next for NDCs?</h3><p>While many countries have yet to submit their commitments, the storyline is already clear:<strong> New NDCs will not put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C.</strong></p><p>The big question now is how countries respond at COP30 to narrow that gap. They must address what comes after NDCs, grappling with how to turn ambition into action and keep a safer future within reach.</p><p>Ultimately, putting forward strong plans — and fulfilling them — are essential levers; not only for limiting warming, but for safeguarding the health, prosperity and security of current and future generations.</p><p><em>Editor's note: This article was originally published in June 2025.

      "description": "<p><strong>WASHINGTON, DC (October 28, 2025) </strong>— The UNFCCC released its <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/650664\">NDC Synthesis Report</a> today, reviewing climate plans from 64 countries, covering roughly 30% of global emissions. The report aggregates submitted plans and their projected emissions reductions, finding that current pledges would reduce emissions by about 17% from their 2019 levels, far short of what’s needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. The analysis reflects submissions received up until September 30, 2025.</p><p>Countries representing 64% of global emissions still have not formally submitted new NDCs and are not included in this analysis.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Melanie Robinson, Global Climate, Economics and Finance Program Director, World Resources Institute: </strong><br /><br />“This report lays bare a frightening gap between what governments have promised and what is needed to protect people and planet. While the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway, it’s clear that countries need to shift from a jog to an all-out sprint.  </p><p>\"Some countries have recognized the economic gains to be made by being among the front-runners in the global energy transition. But too many nations are lagging behind, failing to see that climate action costs less than dealing with climate impacts – and that investing in the new economy is a catalyst for growth, driving jobs, prosperity and security.</p><p>\"The UN analysis shows national climate plans are starting to bend global emissions downward: 2035 targets would lower emissions by about 6% compared with previous 2030 NDC targets, and emissions would peak by 2030 if those NDCs are implemented. But that progress is dwarfed by the vast gap still needed to avoid breaching the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit.  </p><p>“The report paints an incomplete picture because countries representing nearly two-thirds of global emissions either missed the September cut-off for inclusion or have not yet submitted new plans. Those still on the hook to submit must deliver ambitious climate targets if they want to stay competitive, attract investment and benefit their workforce.  </p><p>“Encouragingly, the analysis points out examples of real momentum, with more countries scaling renewable energy, decarbonizing transport and integrating adaptation and just transition into their plans. These are promising developments both countries and cities can seize upon, replicate and scale.</p><p>“Leaders should treat this report not as a warning but as a rallying cry. COP30 must deliver a practical plan to accelerate action this decade - because every fraction of a degree avoided means lives saved, more abundant food and water, better livelihoods, and stronger economies.” </p>",

Between 2002 and 2022, according to <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/forest-insights/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2022/\">Global Forest Watch data</a>, the world’s tropical humid primary rainforests shrunk by 8%, losing an area equivalent to nearly the size of Pakistan. This magnitude of loss has continued unabated, except in a few key tropical rainforest countries such as Brazil and Indonesia.</p><p>The basic challenge continues to be one of simple economics: Cutting and clearing natural forests for timber and agriculture is generally more profitable than leaving trees standing.</p><p>Conventional business practices are not designed to tangibly value and reward the conservation of forests, or their biodiversity and ecosystem services. Combined with continuing global demand for commodities, harmful subsidies in many countries, and weak and/or <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nature-crime-amazon-deforestation\">corrupt forest governance practices</a>, this dynamic has increasingly degraded and destroyed the Earth’s tropical forests.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Illegal logging in the Amazon.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/deforestation-illegal-logging-tfff_0.jpg?VersionId=SFvysLo0joVnaOCndNXDKcdUEkzqjOx0&itok=gUi_AuqT\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>According to data from Global Forest Watch, between 2002 and 2022, the world’s tropical humid primary rainforests shrunk by 8%.

The <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> (TFFF) is designed as a “payment-for-performance” model that uses agreed satellite monitoring standards and systems to reward tropical forest countries with a continuing source of funding as long as they preserve their forests.</p><p> While other forest conservation mechanisms such as <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-redd\">REDD+</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/carbon-markets-tropical-forest-conservation\">carbon markets</a> focus on rewarding emissions reductions, the TFFF takes a different approach. It aims to pay tropical forest countries directly for each hectare of standing forest they maintain, with payments decreasing based on any deforestation or fire-related forest degradation.</p><p>With Brazil’s leadership, the momentum of this year’s annual <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30)</a> taking place in the Amazon, and with effective new satellite monitoring technologies, the TFFF could finally turn forest conservation into an investment that benefits countries, investors and the planet.</p><p>Following several years of technical and diplomatic work, Brazil published the latest iteration of the <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/feedback/\">TFFF Concept Note</a> in October 2025. Just weeks before, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/brazilian-government-announces-us1-billion-contribution-to-the-tropical-forest-forever-facility-tfff/\">announced</a> at the UN General Assembly that Brazil would make the first $1 billion investment into the facility, which ultimately is expected to reach $125 billion. A few weeks later, <a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesia-vows-to-invest-in-brazilled-125-billion-forestry-fund\">Indonesia announced</a> it would also contribute to the facility. The TFFF’s success now depends on other nations, as well as private sector investors, to make it a reality at COP30 and beyond. Currently, Brazil is working with other governments, including the UK, Germany, Norway, the UAE, Singapore and China, and potential private sector investors, to explore how they can commit funding in time for COP30.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1048\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"838\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"642\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"506\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Tropical forest in Nepal.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/tropical-forest-nepal_0.jpg?VersionId=zKDCyfDMoLENNHPhj3gpyzF6sBxWx8hW&itok=a6sC06XW\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Tropical Forest Forever Facility is an innovative fund designed to reward countries for keeping their forests standing. Photo by Teo Tarras/Shutterstock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How Exactly Will the TFFF Be Funded?</h3><p>Unlike most previous international assistance to conserve tropical forests, the TFFF will not be financed by donor grants. Once the facility reaches its $125 billion target (or, likely in the shorter term, a smaller sum), it will be the world’s largest “<a href=\"https://ppp.worldbank.org/blended-finance\">blended finance</a>” mechanism of its kind, designed to pay eligible, participating tropical forest countries annually for maintaining their deforestation rates below 0.5% per year, as measured by agreed geospatial monitoring standards and systems.</p><p>The TFFF will borrow an initial capital base (targeted at $25 billion) from traditional “donor” nations and other countries in a position to invest, such as Brazil and China, and potentially philanthropic foundations, too. These “sponsors” would provide 40-year loans (the facility’s capital), or other comparable investment modalities, at an interest rate comparable to the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds (a 30-year bond is currently less than 5%) and would be the first to take responsibility over any losses in what’s known as a junior position in the debt structure.</p><p>This arrangement creates a safety net that enables the fund to raise an additional $100 billion from private, corporate and philanthropic investors. The combined $125 billion would then be invested in fixed income emerging markets and other sovereign and corporate bonds (excluding fossil fuels and other environmentally destructive sectors), which would earn a higher return.</p><p>The return is ultimately expected to generate some $3 billion to $4 billion per year — enough to make payments of around $4 per hectare of conserved forest to eligible countries which maintain deforestation rates below 0.5% over the long term. (Even in the short term, with a much lesser sum than $125 billion, the payments generated would still be significant.)</p><p>The TFFF governance structure is divided into the Tropical Forest Investment Fund (TFIF), managed by the World Bank under a separate governance structure that would manage the investment fund and determine the availability of funds for forest payments; and the TFFF itself, which would coordinate monitoring and reporting, and distribute forest payments to countries.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1350\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1080\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"827\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"651\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"390\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"How the TFFF will work\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/25-10-22-tfff-v5-facility.png?VersionId=vrP4qkdp6nddRmbMe0AkxRafdldSa9ua&itok=BsbpCBE8\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Where Would the Money Go?</h3><p>The current TFFF proposal includes 74 UN-listed developing countries that combined are home to more than 1 billion hectares of moist, broadleaf tropical and sub-tropical forests.</p><p>The TFFF is not designed to fund countries to reduce their deforestation rates. Rather, it is meant to reward those that already have relatively low deforestation rates, providing a financial incentive to keep their remaining tropical forests standing and prevent any further deforestation. However, if it’s successful, the facility will serve as encouragement for countries with currently high deforestation rates to qualify to join the scheme. A good result would be if countries such as Bolivia, with one of the world’s highest deforestation rates, were able to qualify for TFFF funding in the years to come. The current structure would lead to significant flows of finance to some of the world’s poorest forest countries, including in Africa’s Congo Basin.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1350\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1080\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"827\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"651\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"390\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Countries Eligible for TFFF Payments\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/25-10-22-tfffv2-map.png?VersionId=pg93T2bHxPq7qDuaA_zbHpgPySYhF5iU&itok=l2mvS7Kn\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The TFFF includes several innovative features focused on where the money should go. The first is that it allows countries to allocate TFFF payments as they see fit on their national policies and programs that, directly or indirectly, contribute to tropical and subtropical forest conservation and forests’ sustainable use. Crucially, the TFFF requires countries to disclose what the funds are used for to ensure transparency and allow for public scrutiny and feedback.</p><p>Another striking and positive feature is a provision requiring 20% of payments to go to Indigenous peoples and local communities engaged in tropical forest conservation in eligible countries. This could be the single biggest source of international finance for Indigenous peoples and local communities, so often at the frontline of conservation. This finance could help these communities protect their rights, secure land tenure, tackle illegal mining and criminality, and pursue sustainable alternative livelihoods that are not dependent on clearing areas of forest.</p><p>It is also significant because the TFFF is the only such source of funding that could in some instances be accessed directly by Indigenous peoples and local communities — a provision that they have repeatedly asked for, granting these communities decision-making over the use of the funds.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"955\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"764\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"585\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"461\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"276\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A family in a canoe rows away from a house along a river in the Amazon, Brazil.. \" height=\"276\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/indigenous-family-amazon-tfff_0.jpg?VersionId=9S.bQ9yFUhfzS6npROa9nT01ywtFUsTM&itok=tjGif8nR\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Payments from the TFFF could help protect the rights of Indigenous communities and help them pursue sustainable alternative livelihoods that are not dependent on clearing areas of forest. Photo by Dekaro/iStock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How Will Forests Be Monitored?</h3><p>The TFFF can only succeed if it is built on credible, transparent and operational forest monitoring that relies on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-peoples-local-communities-use-satellite-data-deforestation\">satellite data</a>. This requires methods and data that are produced in a way that can be verified, applied consistently through time and comparable across countries. Robust and universally applied technical standards must be established from the outset, not only to ensure credibility but also to build investor confidence that will attract the early capital needed for scale.</p><p>A core principle of the TFFF is that participating nations are expected to use their own national forest monitoring systems, provided these systems meet established quality and transparency criteria. For countries without a qualifying national system, a compliant third-party system, such as <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch</a> (managed by WRI) or the EU’s Joint Research Center tropical forests platform, may be used. Given this diversity in monitoring approaches, establishing agreed common methodological standards and definitions across all systems will be paramount.</p><p>The TFFF also proposes a fixed forest definition to be applied across all participating countries, creating a common basis for how forests are measured and valued. By setting a 20% to 30% canopy density threshold, a 5-meter minimum tree height and by excluding plantations, this definition establishes a solid technical foundation for consistent and comparable measurements.</p><h3>What’s Still Needed to Launch the TFFF?</h3><p>First, sponsors need to follow Brazil’s and Indonesia’s lead and commit contributions to the initial hoped-for $25 billion tranche of junior capital. If additional sponsors fail to make commitments at COP30, the TFFF may lose momentum in 2026, causing private sector investors to doubt the viability of the model.</p><p>It is therefore vitally important for industrialized nations across the world without tropical forests to make a significant financial commitment to this bold and ambitious idea. The stakes are global: If tropical forests are lost, adaptation costs from the ensuing climate impacts would far exceed these investments. For wealthy nations, investing in the TFFF is not only about justice and responsibility, but also a matter of economic self-interest. Tropical forests are, in addition to being sovereign national assets, a global public good, with a universal responsibility for their protection.</p><p>The World Bank Board has agreed to manage the funds <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/the-world-bank-confirmed-as-trustee-and-interim-host-of-the-tropical-forest-forever-facility/\">as the trustee and interim host</a> of the TFFF and formalized initial arrangements at its October 2025 meeting, which should provide a strong confidence signal for both sponsors and the private sector. But the World Bank will have to move rapidly to establish the TFIF to maintain momentum and move toward an operational phase of the facility.</p><p>Once all of that is in place, a key priority will be development of the operations manual that will govern how the TFFF actually works, including work on some of the more difficult technical issues. These include:</p><h4>Degradation and Leakage</h4><p>Not all forest loss is caused by deforestation. Forest degradation, which plays a major role in carbon loss and ecosystem decline (and often occurs at smaller spatial scales) can also take place.</p><p>Currently, the TFFF proposes to only consider fire-damaged areas (using burn scars as a proxy) as indicators of degradation, subsequently reducing payments by a 1:35 discount rate. But other degradation factors, such as selective logging, roadbuilding, mining and some edge effects, can be detected using 30-meter or 10-meter satellite data. Including both fire and non-fire degradation would strengthen the system’s integrity and ensure payments reflect actual forest conditions.</p><p>Deforestation “leakage” is another thorny issue: the TFFF focuses on broadleaf tropical and sub-tropical forests, the most important forests globally for both biodiversity and climate change. However, there is worry that this might cause deforestation to move into other biomes not covered by the TFFF — <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/01/brazils-soy-moratorium-dramatically-reduced-amazon-deforestation/\">Brazil’s Cerrado</a> and southern Africa’s Miombo woodlands are good examples — without notice or punitive measures. The TFFF seeks to address this by requiring participating countries to monitor and report forest cover changes in non-TFFF forest areas where significant increases in deforestation could trigger additional scrutiny and potential payment holds. Though this is a good conceptual solution, implementation could be complex given, among other issues, the difficulties associated with monitoring deforestation in drier or sparser forest landscapes. More work will be needed to ensure that the TFFF does not simply displace, rather than prevent, forest loss.</p><h4>Consideration for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities</h4><p>It will also be critical to maintain a strong consultative process with civil society and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-forest-pledges-must-center-forest-communities\">Indigenous communities</a> as the TFFF — particularly its operations manual — is developed and moves toward implementation. Much of civil society is supportive of the TFFF and its efforts to engage Indigenous peoples and local communities; some remain critical and circumspect. There is no formal consensus on the TFFF among the diverse Indigenous peoples’ organizations across the world’s tropical forests. Continuing dialogue, consultation and free, prior and informed consent will therefore be critical in the years ahead.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A home along a river in Belém, Brazil.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/indigenous-communities-tfff-belem-brazil_0.jpg?VersionId=QGioHVL8kk__CcBgiuUXbIWROMY8GRDD&itok=fsP8-bKz\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A home along the Guama River in Belém, Brazil, where COP30 will take place.

It is only in the past decade that credible, affordable satellite monitoring of forest cover has emerged. And there are no international covenants or treaties designating official satellite monitoring standards or systems.<br /><br />In developing its monitoring standards, the TFFF should consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine-tuning its measurement standards </strong>by aligning the standard minimum mapping unit with the pixel resolution of existing, free satellite data archives (30-meters or 10-meters) to provide a more accurate picture of forest dynamics. Using a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/rethinking-definition-forest-monitoring\">finer mapping unit</a>, instead of the proposed 1-hectare minimum mapping unit, would also enable more effective monitoring of forest degradation events like logging and roadbuilding.</li><li>Ensuring that the monitoring systems that underpin the TFFF’s payment calculations provide <strong>open, independently verifiable data</strong>; use methods that produce data that are transparent and reproducible; and regularly validate the results using good practice and international reporting guidelines.</li><li>Finally, <strong>governance will be critical </strong>to help ensure that technical decisions remain evidence based. The TFFF’s operations manual will codify the detailed rules and procedures for monitoring, so its development should include structured opportunities for expert and stakeholder input.</li></ul><p>In short, there is a clear pathway: strong technical standards, robust degradation monitoring, validation, open data and shared governance. The technology is ready; what is needed now is collective agreement to put it into practice.</p><h3>The TFFF’s Critical Contribution to the Global Forest Challenge</h3><p>In summary, the TFFF could make a potentially critical contribution to addressing the world’s forest challenges, which are so closely linked to the biodiversity and climate crises we face. But, as the TFFF proponents themselves have noted, it is not a panacea; other forms of finance will also be needed, and of course there are many other dimensions of tackling tropical forest loss, including governance, legality, regulation, demand and consumption shifts.</p><p>The TFFF also inherently faces risks in a volatile world where the future of economies and markets cannot be predicted; it is a bold idea at a time of volatility and instability. But after more than 30 years of forest conservation, forest finance commitments and arrangements that have yet to turn the tide, the TFFF presents an ambitious idea from a major rainforest country that has real potential to make a potentially transformative impact in conserving tropical forests.</p><p>It is therefore a pressing global imperative for the international community to contribute generously to its success, starting at COP30, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest — a tropical rainforest, like others, on which the future well-being of humanity so profoundly depends.  </p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Brussels (October 24, 2025) </strong>– The European Council <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/d2nhnqso/20251023-european-council-conclusions-en.pdf\">yesterday reaffirmed its support</a> for the EU’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040. However, it stopped short of setting a clear and ambitious target for its upcoming Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which is due by COP30. <br /><br />In September, the European Commission put forward a “statement of intent” to cut emissions by 66.25 – 72.5% by 2035 from 1990 levels.  <br /><br /><strong>Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, World Resources Institute:  </strong><br /><br />“Europe stands behind the 90% emission cut goal by 2040 ‒ a strong signal of continued intent. But without formalizing its 2035 climate plan (NDC), the pathway to climate neutrality remains unclear.  <br /><br />\"EU leaders have now put the ball in the court of environment ministers, who must deliver a science-based and credible NDC by early November, ahead of COP30 in Belém. A clear, high-ambition pathway is the most credible way to turn the EU's climate goals into real action: cleaner air, stronger energy security, resilient communities and lasting competitiveness. <br /><br />“We warn against the EU Council’s reliance on carbon credits to hit its 2040 goal. While credits, under strict guardrails, can help support decarbonization efforts abroad, they don't replace the structural changes needed at home. Europe must invest in transforming energy, industry, housing, and transport.   <br /><br />“Every euro spent on credits is a euro not invested in delivering cleaner, economic growth, jobs and resilience for European citizens. In this context, the Council’s call to revise the agreed EU ETS 2, the EU's emissions trading scheme for transport and buildings starting in 2027, risks undermining business confidence and the credibility of EU climate policy.  <br /><br />\"The EU's repeated delays come at a cost. Missing the September 2025 NDC deadline means the EU ‒ one of the world's major economic blocs ‒ will be left out of the UNFCCC's NDC forthcoming Synthesis Report, losing an opportunity to spur greater ambition from other major emitters. EU environment ministers must grab the chance to reclaim Europe’s global climate leadership with the most ambitious NDC before COP30, showing European business clear investment pathways to a clean, competitive economy.”  </p>",

      "description": "<p>The world <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">is losing</a> 18 soccer fields of tropical primary every minute; much of it is the result of clearing for farms, pastures and tree plantations.</p><p>As a major buyer of commodities largely responsible for fueling deforestation — such as palm oil, cocoa, coffee, soy, cattle and timber — the EU has both a responsibility and an opportunity to help shift global markets toward more sustainable supply chains. The landmark <strong>EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)</strong>, adopted in 2023, requires businesses to demonstrate that the products they sell or export to the EU do not come from land that was recently deforested or degraded. </p><p>The EUDR is a key step in responding to today’s deforestation and supporting countries in achieving their national forest protection policies. <strong>Yet despite its promise, the regulation has faced delays and pushback, threatening its timely implementation.</strong></p><p>In September 2025, the EU Commission <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-time-to-enforce-not-delay-eu-deforestation-regulation\">proposed delaying</a> the EUDR's enforcement until December 2026, pushing back its start date for the second year in a row. This was after the  <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/07/07/nineteen-eu-countries-call-for-simplification-of-eu-deforestation-law\">EU Agriculture Ministers issued a letter calling for the EUDR's simplification</a>, in July 2025. The EU Commission then <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-european-commission-protects-eudrs-core-principles\">reversed course in October 2025</a>, putting forward a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2464\">formal proposal</a> to simplify the EUDR for micro and small businesses, as well as downstream operators. If approved by the European Parliament and European Council, the December 2026 delay would only be in place for these businesses. For all other companies, the EUDR will go into force as initially planned on Dec. 30, 2025, with a six-month grace period.</p><p>At a time when forests are increasingly under threat, it’s more urgent than ever to understand the regulation and ensure its full and rapid implementation. Here, we dive deeply into the legislation's details and potential impacts.</p><h3>What Is the EUDR?</h3><p>The EUDR is a landmark law that came into force in June 2023. Its goal is to ensure that certain products sold in or exported to the EU do not come from land that was deforested or degraded after Dec. 31, 2020. The regulation is designed to prevent EU consumer demand from driving further forest loss or damage, while also reducing the region’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity decline.</p><p>The EUDR covers timber and six key agricultural commodities: cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soy, as well as products made from them such as beef, furniture and chocolate. To be sold in or exported from the EU market, these products must meet the following <strong>three conditions</strong>:</p><ol><li>They are <strong>deforestation-free</strong>.</li><li>They have been <strong>produced in compliance with the relevant laws of the country of origin</strong>.</li><li>They are <strong>covered by a due diligence statement</strong>, showing that the company has checked the origin and ensured the products meet EUDR requirements.</li></ol><p>This means businesses must demonstrate that any EUDR-covered commodities were not produced on land <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data/satellite-data-eu-regulation-deforestation-free-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">that was deforested</a> nor did they <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/monitoring-forest-degradation-eudr/\" target=\"_blank\">contribute to forest degradation</a> after the Dec. 31, 2020 cutoff date. Although the regulation is legally in place, companies are not yet required to comply yet. The rules will apply starting from Dec. 30, 2025, for large enterprises and December 2026, for small and medium-sized businesses (if the proposal made by the European Commission is adopted by the EU institutions).</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1026\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"821\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"629\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"495\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The EUDR development milestone timeline.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/25-10-23-eudr-timelinev4_0.png?VersionId=SIGJazpE85F4bRH3qS7aF32rzKq9A7LB&itok=R9mNKbLJ\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Why Is the EUDR important?</h3><p>The EUDR offers a major opportunity for the EU to reduce its role in global deforestation and biodiversity loss, as well as help create deforestation-free supply chains. It supports the commitment made by the 144 countries that signed the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration in 2021 to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. It can also serve as a model for other major consumer markets looking to lower their environmental footprints.</p><p>Since 2014, the EU has been the second-largest importer of goods linked to tropical deforestation after China. In 2017 alone, it accounted for <a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwwfeu.awsassets.panda.org%2Fdownloads%2Fstepping_up___the_continuing_impact_of_eu_consumption_on_nature_worldwide_fullreport_low_res.pdf&data=05%7C02%7CSarah.Brown%40wri.org%7C8b3cc945469b4a72a57a08ddbf074695%7C476bac1f36b24ad98699cda6bad1f862%7C0%7C0%7C638876760158329836%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xoQHWFyeUsGUmUQW8%2Fo8i2eTAuqAWgKIXXe5E9iAy9U%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">16% of global deforestation</a> tied to international trade — equal to 203,000 hectares of forest.</p><p>More recently, in 2021, the <a href=\"https://comtradeplus.un.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EU was among the world’s top five importers</a> of five of the six agricultural commodities covered by the EUDR (cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber and soy) and the largest importer of cocoa beans and coffee worldwide<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/#footnotes\"><sup>1</sup></a> .

In fact, out of 160 agricultural commodities imported by the EU, just six — beef, palm oil, soy, cocoa, coffee and rubber, as covered by the EUDR — made up 58% of the estimated forest loss tied to EU imports.</p><p>By reducing the EU’s forest-loss footprint and tackling deforestation risks in its supply chains, the EUDR could help reverse deforestation worldwide. In 2024, a record 6.7 million hectares of <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\" target=\"_blank\">primary tropical forests</a> were lost — nearly double the 2023 rate and equivalent of losing 18 soccer fields of forest every minute. While wildfires captured global attention, some of the increase was due to agricultural conversion and logging.</p><h3>What Challenges and Setbacks Has the EUDR Faced?</h3><p>In December 2024, <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/3234/oj/eng\" target=\"_blank\">the EU postponed the start of EUDR </a>compliance by 12 months to give companies more time to prepare to meet the regulation’s requirements. Then in September 2025, the EU Commission again signaled its intention to delay implementation by another year, reportedly because of issues with the EU platform used to submit due diligence statements.</p><p>A month later, the EU Commission put forward a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2464\">formal proposal</a> to simplify the EUDR for micro and small businesses, as well as downstream operators, delaying the enforcement date of the EUDR for these enterprises. If approved by the European Parliament and European Council, these businesses would not have to comply with the EUDR until December 2026. Large companies would still be held to a Dec. 30, 2025 start date, but with a 6-month grace period for checks and enforcement in light of issues with the IT platform.</p><p>In May 2025, the European Commission published the regulation’s <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-implementing-regulation-laying-down-rules-application-deforestation-regulation_en\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarking classification</a> system, which ranks countries as low, standard and high risk based on indicators assessing the deforestation risk linked to commodity production in each country. The ranking system was designed to help businesses and enforcement authorities in the EU to conduct due diligence and enforce compliance. The risk levels indicate the percentage of checks on shipments, with greater scrutiny given to higher-risk countries. </p><p>New proposals call on the EU Commission to revise the benchmarking classification system introduced in 2025. Some EU member state representatives have suggested adding a “no-risk” category to exempt certain countries from due diligence requirements; another suggestion proposed removing the system altogether. But <a href=\"https://www.fern.org/publications-insight/wto-implications-of-the-proposed-no-risk-amendment-to-the-eudr/\" target=\"_blank\">changes like these</a> could <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\">create loopholes and ultimately weaken</a> the regulation’s effectiveness. The European Parliament already <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\">rejected a similar idea in 2024</a> for that very reason.</p><p>The EUDR was agreed upon following a lengthy negotiation between EU institutions and member states, as well as impact assessments and extensive consultations. Derailing its implementation would penalize producer countries and companies that have already invested in compliance, and it would create confusion and uncertainty in the EU market. The regulation may not be perfect, but it’s a necessary step toward deforestation-free supply chains. <a href=\"https://www.cofcointernational.com/newsroom/first-cofco-soymeal-shipment-aligned-with-upcoming-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr-requirements-loads-in-argentina/\" target=\"_blank\">Many companies</a> have already shown that <a href=\"https://www.adm.com/en-us/news/news-releases/2024/7/as-eu-deforestation-regulation-approaches-adm-offers-fully-verified-segregated-traceable-soybean-meal-and-oil-to-european-customers/\" target=\"_blank\">EUDR</a> <a href=\"https://www.danzer.com/en/company/media-relations/danzer-blog/item/we-are-ready-for-the-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr\" target=\"_blank\">compliance</a> is possible, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neumann-kaffee-gruppe_neumannkaffeegruppe-nkg-greencoffee-activity-7341043266814902282-ZxzX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAE1-pABvCIe5Hj5bAjDVEQyxMlfXsVXU2U\" target=\"_blank\">several</a> have urged the EU to uphold the legal text and stick to <a href=\"https://www.tchibo.com/de/de/news/tchibo-fordert-umsetzung-eudr\" target=\"_blank\">implementation timeline</a>.</p><p>Since adoption, the EUDR has faced criticism from both inside and outside the EU. Most concerns focus on cost and complexity of compliance, as well as fairness, particularly for smallholder farmers. In response, the European Commission, EU member states and other development institutions have ramped up investment in <a href=\"https://green-forum.ec.europa.eu/nature-and-biodiversity/deforestation-regulation-implementation_en\" target=\"_blank\">EUDR preparedness</a> by issuing resources and guidance, with a particular emphasis on <a href=\"https://zerodeforestationhub.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">preventing smallholder exclusion from the EU market</a>.</p><h3>What Counts as Deforestation and Degradation Under the EUDR?</h3><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\">The regulation's <strong>definition of a forest </strong>largely follows the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which defines it as land larger than 0.5 hectares with trees taller than 5 meters and a canopy cover of at least 10% that is not primarily used for farming or urban development.</p></div><p>Under the EUDR, <strong>deforestation</strong> refers to clearing forest to make way for agriculture. The key factor is the conversion of land that was forest in 2020 into farmland — such as pastures or soy plantations. It’s a complete land-use change: the forest is no longer a forest.</p><ul><li>If that forest is cleared — whether by people or natural events like fire — and then converted into farmland, such as pastures for raising cattle or fields for soy or palm oil, it is considered deforestation.</li><li>However, if a forest is cleared, for example by fire (whether from human activity or natural causes) and is <strong>not</strong> used to produce any of the six EUDR-covered agricultural commodities, it is <strong>not </strong>considered deforestation under the regulations.</li><li>Forests used for wood production are not considered deforestation unless they’re also used for agriculture, for example, cattle grazing under the tree canopy.</li></ul><p>The EUDR also covers <strong>degradation</strong>. Land that was forest in 2020 can be used for wood production and remain classified as a forest, even if it’s temporarily unstocked, according to EUDR definitions. A forest used for wood production is not considered degraded unless there's a specific structural change, such as:</p><ul><li>Converting primary forest (native, untouched forest) into other wooded land (trees have 5%-10% canopy cover) or into plantation or planted forest.</li><li>Converting naturally regenerating forest (which has largely grown back on its own) into other wooded land used or plantation forest.</li></ul><h3>Who Does the EUDR Affect?</h3><p>The EUDR affects any company that imports, produces or exports specific products, and their derivatives, to or from the EU market. This includes <strong>operators</strong> (those placing products on the market or exporting them from the market) and <strong>traders</strong> (those distributing and selling products).</p><p>It applies to companies based in the EU and internationally, and to businesses of all sizes, from micro and small enterprises to large corporations. However, larger businesses face stricter reporting requirements than smaller ones.</p><p>The EUDR spans multiple sectors, from food and beverage (such as companies sourcing cocoa and coffee) to fashion (leather goods, for example) to the healthcare industry (products such as latex gloves).</p><h3>How Are Countries and Companies Preparing for the EUDR?</h3><p>Under the EUDR, companies must prove that products linked to deforestation or degradation after Dec. 31, 2020, are not entering the EU market. This requires a due diligence process: collecting supply chain information (including geolocation), assessing the risk of deforestation and taking steps to eliminate any identified risk before the product can be put on the market.</p><h4>Country-level efforts</h4><p>Many producer countries are already taking concrete steps to prepare for the EUDR, from adopting national plans to developing traceability systems and improving data transparency. For example, Indonesia, Ghana and Vietnam are investing in government-led efforts to make information available to companies that must comply with the regulation. Delaying enforcement or altering the regulation’s scope could undermine these leading producer countries.</p><p>Vietnam stands out as a strong example of how the EUDR is reinforcing national policies to combat deforestation. As a top exporter of rubber and coffee, the country has shifted its focus from illegal logging to broader deforestation risks in agriculture since the regulation’s introduction.  In 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development adopted a <a href=\"https://www.4c-services.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/02.-Nguyen-Nhu-Cuong_Action-Plan-for-the-compliance-with-EUDR-of-Viet-Nam.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">national action plan</a> prioritizing sustainable agricultural transformation. The following year, it launched a traceability system for coffee farms, piloting geospatial verification (such as satellite images) in key producing provinces. Developed through <a href=\"https://idh.org/news/vietnams-coffee-sector-marks-a-landmark-step-towards-sustainability-launching-the-eudr-database-system-for-forest-and-coffee-growing-areas\" target=\"_blank\">public-private collaboration</a>, the system cross-references land-use maps and cadastral data to ensure EUDR compliance. Plans are also underway to expand it to rubber and cocoa.</p><p>Vietnam’s progress shows how the regulation can act as a catalyst for stronger policy alignment between global market demands and local sustainability goals. </p><p>EU member states are also preparing by using satellite and aerial earth observation data, such as forest maps from 2020 (the EUDR cutoff year) to detect deforestation, alongside other monitoring solutions and tools to support compliant imports. </p><h4>Private-sector efforts</h4><p>Companies across supply chains are ramping up EUDR preparations, sparking a wave of innovation in monitoring and traceability. Many are developing satellite-based systems to verify deforestation-free sourcing, training smallholder farmers to meet EUDR requirements and partnering with governments and NGOs to improve data sharing and risk assessment.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.meridia.land/case/unilevers-smallholder-hub-programme\" target=\"_blank\">Unilever and Meridia</a> are working together to map smallholder farmers in Indonesia, making it possible to trace palm oil from plantation to mill. <a href=\"https://sustainablenaturalrubber.org/annual-report-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">The Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR)</a> has created a system to help companies follow sustainability practices and demonstrate EUDR compliance. Open-source platforms like WRI’s Global Forest Watch are also <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/satellite-data-eu-regulation-deforestation-free-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">supporting companies in verifying supply chains</a>.</p><p>These efforts from governments, companies and EU countries show how the EUDR is already driving unprecedented action — transforming compliance from a burden into an opportunity to build more responsible and transparent supply chains. The challenge now is scaling these solutions across all commodities and regions.</p><h3>What's Next for the EUDR?</h3><p>The EUDR represents a major milestone in the fight against commodity-driven deforestation.</p><p>The EU must reject attempts to weaken the regulation’s core requirements. Its effectiveness depends on maintaining its ambition without dilution or delay. Backtracking at this stage would undermine the EUDR’s credibility and send the wrong signal to global markets. </p><p>At the same time, the EU should also step up efforts to provide businesses with practical training and support to help them develop the skills needed for compliance, especially for small businesses that may otherwise struggle to meet requirements.</p><p>The European Parliament and Council must also <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-european-commission-protects-eudrs-core-principles\">give businesses clear guidance</a> — and avoid adding uncertainty with further changes to the law. The EUDR is not only a necessary response to the crisis of forest loss, but also a vital tool to support and complement producer country efforts to halt deforestation by 2030.</p><p id=\"footnotes\"><em>Editor's Note: This piece was originally published on July 8, 2025.
