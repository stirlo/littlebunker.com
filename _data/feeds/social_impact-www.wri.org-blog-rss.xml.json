      "description": "<p>As the climate crisis intensifies, transitioning to sustainable energy has emerged as a pivotal focus of global efforts. Outdated and fragile energy systems impede countries and regions from increasing energy access and affordability, improving air pollution and living standards, and driving industrialization and modernization.</p><p>Since the international Paris Agreement on climate change was signed in 2015, global renewable energy investments have nearly tripled. However, these investments are predominantly concentrated in developed countries, leaving developing countries with a need of approximately $1.7 trillion annually in renewable energy investments. In 2022, foreign direct investment to developing countries only <a href=\"https://unctad.org/publication/world-investment-report-2023\">covered 32%</a> of this need.</p><p>At the heart of the global climate agenda is Africa, a continent of immense potential with abundant renewable energy resources, a growing youth population and vast natural capital. However, it is also one of the most vulnerable regions to the negative impacts of climate change. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly <a href=\"https://www.afd.fr/en/electrification-clean-energy-sub-saharan-africa\">80% of the world’s population without access to electricity</a>, yet in 2022, the continent received only 1% of global renewable energy. Addressing Africa's energy challenges and accelerating its transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy are crucial for global climate action.</p><p>As Africa’s key trading and investment partners, China and the European Union can play an important role in supporting the continent’s energy transition. Since the early 21st century, both China and the EU have built upon their existing ties with Africa to establish and strengthen new forms of cooperation with energy as a critical area of focus.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1024\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"819\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"627\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"494\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A woman holding a hoe watches a man operate a solar water pump in Malawi, Africa.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/solar-water-pump-milawi-africa_1.jpg?VersionId=1vLzi57XM3LuZSCIkpHOi7Kt6Ky5xFD9&itok=xUVzwdjs\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Africa is embracing the energy transition and taking advantage of its abundant natural resources, such as sunlight, to install solar panels that power water pumps used for irrigation in Malawi.

For the past 15 years, China has already been Africa's <a href=\"https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/wsdwhfz/202409/t20240909_1392908.html\">largest trading partner</a> and remains the largest developing country investor in the region. At the 2024 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), both sides <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/wjbz/jh/202410/t20241021_11510754.html\">elevated and strengthened their partnership</a>. Under collaborative frameworks like FOCAC, the China-Africa Union Energy Partnership and the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, numerous projects have incorporated renewable energy objectives. The ongoing <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/africa-solar-belt-implementation-focac-2024\">Africa Solar Belt program</a>, for example, underscores this commitment, with China pledging at least 100 million yuan (about $14 million) in public funds from 2024 to 2027 to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/africa-solar-belt-implementation-focac-2024\">power 50,000 households</a> in Africa with off-grid solar systems.</p><p> The EU, through the Africa-EU Partnership and agreements with the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), is working to shift from a traditional “donor-recipient” relationship with Africa toward <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/africa-and-eu_en\">a more equal partnership</a>. In its latest Africa strategy and external energy policy, the EU prioritizes green transition and energy access as core objectives. Under its Global Gateway Initiative, the EU launched the Africa-EU Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), aiming for at least 50 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in Africa by 2030 as part of a 150 billion euro (about $170 million) investment plan, helping address energy access challenges for at least 100 million people. Additionally, many European countries have established bilateral partnerships with countries in Africa.</p><p>These commitments reflect a growing recognition of Africa’s crucial role in the global energy transition. However, meeting this moment requires confronting the scale and complexity of Africa’s own energy realities.</p><p>As Africa’s population grows and industrialization accelerates, electricity demand is projected to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X22000876\">increase tenfold between 2015 and 2065</a>. This surge presents profound challenges for the continent's energy transition, including persistent energy access disparities, limited economic viability of power development, inadequate power grid infrastructure and substantial investment shortfalls.</p><p>China, a global leader in renewable energy supply chains, brings extensive experience in project development, technology innovation and strong financial resources. Europe, on the other hand, excels in renewable energy finance and sustainable development standards and benefits from geographic proximity to Africa. Africa, beyond being a large and fast-growing market, offers unmatched opportunities for market expansion, abundant renewable energy resources essential for the global energy transition, a dynamic and youthful workforce, and the potential for green industrialization and innovation.  </p><p>Together, China, Europe and Africa can forge a powerful trilateral cooperation in renewable energy that can unlock synergies, drive inclusive and sustainable development, and contribute meaningfully to global climate goals while advancing Africa’s own energy realities.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Solar panels covering the roof of a small home in the midst of a lush green forest.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2024-08/home-solar-panels-sao-tome-e-principe.jpg?VersionId=Gg6FZdVAQ4FhXjxlyBVWLMBk_.TTLZ8y&itok=-bnf60vH\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Solar panels cover the roof of a home in São Tomé and Príncipe, one of the African countries that has initiated solar power development plans with support from China under the Africa Solar Belt Program.

Microgrid and off-grid renewable energy technologies, designed to adapt to local conditions and resources, are cost-effective and easy to maintain, making them well-suited to address Africa’s electricity supply challenges. European and Chinese technologies, resources and know-how can play a vital role in addressing electricity access for the hard-to-reach populations.</p><h5>2) Integrating renewable energy with other sectors to boost benefits</h5><p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge market for the application of distributed renewable energy in agricultural, mining, industrial and commercial sectors. Integrating renewable energy in these sectors, a concept known as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/productive-use-renewable-energy-africa\">Productive Use of Renewable Energy (PURE)</a>, can significantly boost the demand for renewable energy. To unlock this potential, China, the EU and Africa have the opportunity to collaborate in developing small and smart business models that prioritize cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Coupled with innovative financing solutions, this approach can help lower electricity costs, promote local industrialization and create jobs — delivering economic, environmental and social benefits in an integrated way.</p><h5>3) Renewable energy production to create new economic opportunities</h5><p>Africa’s abundant renewable resources and land offer distinct advantages in harnessing renewable energy, presenting new opportunities for Africa to boost its growth through low energy prices and even by assessing opportunities of its proximity to Europe, a key green hydrogen demand center. Through a trilateral collaboration, Europe can leverage on its market demands to facilitate an African export-oriented industry, for example in green energy, which would then boost the trade balances between these regions. Equally, China can leverage on its manufacturing and technological capacities to enable and facilitate this trilateral collaboration.  </p><h5>4) Upgrading and expanding power grids to enhance energy security</h5><p>The planning, investment and construction of cross-border power grids are critical for Africa to achieve energy security. The African Union (AU) launched the <a href=\"https://au.int/en/afsem#:~:text=AfSEM%20is%20designed%20to%20bring,response%20for%20strong%20growth%20of\">Africa Single Electricity Market (AfSEM)</a> to integrate Africa's five regional power pools into a unified electricity market. This initiative, supported by the African Continental Power Systems Masterplan, aims to boost energy security, optimize resource utilization, reduce energy costs and improve electricity access for all 55 AU member states, serving over 1.3 billion people. </p><p>The flagship AU Agenda 2063 initiative also provides a strategic solution for balancing electricity supply and demand. By improving cross-border power transmission and storage, electricity surplus and shortage across countries and regions can be balanced more effectively. However, this field requires overcoming high technical barriers and substantial funding needs, necessitating international support. The complexity and capital intensity of regional grid infrastructure present a clear opportunity for trilateral cooperation.</p><p>China, EU and African institutions can pool their complementary strengths — China’s experience in large-scale infrastructure development, the EU’s expertise in regulatory harmonization and smart grid technologies, and Africa’s political momentum and regional frameworks — to co-develop grid expansion projects. </p><p>Additionally, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence also have the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of large, interconnected power grids. Joint investment, technical assistance and capacity building can help overcome the technical and financial barriers, while accelerating the realization of AfSEM’s goals.</p><h3>Financial Support and International Exchange Are Indispensable</h3><p>Turning these collaborative visions into tangible outcomes hinges on two critical enablers:</p><h5>1) Mobilizing private capital to bridge funding gaps is crucial for cooperation among China, Europe and Africa</h5><p>Exploring the financial mechanisms that would enable deeper uptake of renewable energy and the associated de-risking mechanisms or tools that would be required is vital. Policy-based financial institutions or public funds can mitigate financing and investment risks in renewable energy projects by offering strategic products like guarantees and insurance, thereby attracting more private capital. Moreover, promoting coordination of cross-border and regional investment criteria among financial institutions will help streamline renewable energy financing channels, facilitating efficient capital and project matching. Under a trilateral cooperation, Europe’s deep financial markets can offer the necessary seed capital and de-risking instruments while China provides supply chain finance that would enable it to leverage its manufacturing prowess. In parallel, Africa could focus on deepening its local capital markets potentially by integrating its capital markets and by bolstering the available home-grown financial capital to the renewable energy sector.</p><h5>2) Strengthening the alignment of global initiatives </h5><p>Efforts can focus on enhancing benchmarking, mutual recognition and standardization in areas such as green supply chain management, product carbon footprint certification, and ESG management throughout the clean technology supply chain, including the mining and processing of upstream minerals. Establishing joint standards can reduce friction and barriers in trade and investment cooperation among China, Europe and Africa, supporting Africa’s balanced approach to energy transition and sustainable development.</p><p>As is the case with bilateral collaborations, a successful trilateral collaboration between China, Europe and Africa would need to provide mutual benefits for all players particularly as the shifting global winds of country-first engagements loom.</p><p><em>WRI Europe’s </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/stientje-van-veldhoven\"><em>Stientje van Veldhoven</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/angela-bekkers\"><em>Angela Bekkers</em></a><em> contributed to this article.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>Amid global climate-action promises, many countries have pledged to restore degraded land and expand tree cover. Ethiopia has taken that commitment one step further.</p><p>In a landmark move, Ethiopia's government launched the Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration Special Fund, allocating 0.5% to 1% of its annual federal budget — about $40 to $80 million — to restoring degraded landscapes. Approved by the House of Peoples’ Representatives on Dec. 24, 2024, the fund positions Ethiopia as a pioneer in using federal resources to advance large-scale restoration, setting a powerful precedent for other nations across the world to follow. </p><p>The fund forms part of Ethiopia’s broader <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/partnerships/green-legacy-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Green Legacy Initiative</a> (GLI), a national program launched in 2019 to combat environmental degradation and build a greener, more climate-resilient country. By establishing a dedicated financing mechanism, the country aims to scale up its restoration efforts with sustainable public investment.</p><p>The GLI recognizes that land restoration is more than just planting trees — it can improve food security, enhance air quality, increase water availability, boost climate resilience and create jobs. Ethiopia’s approach offers a promising model for how stable public financing can drive large-scale restoration in climate-vulnerable countries. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"930\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"819\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"628\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"494\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A community-based tree planting initiative in Arsi Zone in southern Ethiopia.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/south-ethiopia_0.jpg?VersionId=lNaVbhVOFW_.MbSNI5THh4EkxZ84nbbp&itok=IgNZJsLi\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A community-based tree planting initiative in Arsi Zone in southern Ethiopia.

Through its GLI, the country exceeded its initial goals by planting over 25 billion trees in just four years, including a reported <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ethiopia-plants-over-350-million-trees-day-setting-new-world-record#:~:text=Over%20350%20million%20trees%20were%20planted%20in%20an,single%20day%20in%201,000%20sites%20across%20the%20country.\" target=\"_blank\">350 million trees</a> in a single day in August 2019, a feat believed to have set an unofficial new world record. </p><p>To date, the initiative has planted more than <a href=\"http://www.ethio-greenlegacy.et/\" target=\"_blank\">32 billion seedlings</a>, with a goal of reaching 50 billion trees by 2030. It has already generated significant social benefits, including the creation of more than 767,000 jobs in areas such as nursery management, seedling production, agroforestry and sustainable land management throughout the country —  many of them for women and youth. </p><p>Ethiopia has also made the most ambitious commitment under the African Forest Landscape Initiative <a href=\"https://afr100.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Trees_Forests_Profits_Ethiopia_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">AFR100</a>, pledging to restore 22 million hectares (84,942 square miles) of degraded land. This aligns with its broader international commitments under the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests, both of which aim to combat deforestation and promote large-scale land restoration.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"903\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"796\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"609\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"480\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"287\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A restoration site in Ethiopia\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/restoration-e_0.jpg?VersionId=HK9D1WQDsQaGO7bYoq6svPX3AYYWPytf&itok=WkbOgitH\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A restoration site in Ethiopia. Tsion Issayas/WRI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Restoration Brings a Host of Benefits</h3><p>After decades of severe deforestation, Ethiopia is beginning to reverse forest and land degradation through coordinated national efforts.  Between 2013 and 2023, the annual deforestation rate fell from 92,000 hectares (355 square miles) to 27,703 hectares (107 square miles), according to <a href=\"https://www.efd.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ETH_FOREST_COVER-_DEFORESTATION_report_final_EFD_JUNE_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.efd.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ETH_FOREST_COVER-_DEFORESTATION_report_final_EFD_JUNE_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">forest cover increased </a>from 15.5% in 2013 to 23.6% during the same period. </p><p>But there’s still much work to do. Between 2000 and 2013, Ethiopia lost an average of <a href=\"https://redd.unfccc.int/media/ethiopia_frel_3.2_final_modified_submission.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">92,000 hectares</a> (355 square miles) of forest each year. A growing population and rising demand for land continue to fuel deforestation. Land degradation costs Ethiopia an estimated <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19168-3_14\" target=\"_blank\">$4.3 billion per year </a>due to reduced agricultural productivity and loss of ecosystem services such as food production and water availability. The long-term economic losses from inaction are estimated to be <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19168-3_14\" target=\"_blank\">four times higher </a>than the cost of restoring degraded land.</p><p>Ethiopia is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. Increasingly severe droughts, floods and landslides have taken a devastating toll in the country. In 2024, landslides in the southern Gofa region caused by heavy rains were the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the country, killing <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/25/ethiopia-landslide-death-toll-rises-to-257-could-almost-double-un\" target=\"_blank\">at least 250 people</a> and displacing more than 14,000.  </p><p>Degraded and deforested landscapes increase the risk of climate-related disasters. Events like the Gofa landslides underscore the urgency for Ethiopia to build climate resilience, and land restoration is increasingly recognized as part of the solution.  </p><p>But restoration is about more than just planting trees. Delivering on the country’s restoration commitments could bring widespread environmental, social and economic gains, including: </p><ul><li><strong>Food security. </strong>Restored land can help Ethiopia improve agricultural productivity, ensuring a stable food supply for its growing population, especially in rural areas.</li><li><strong>Water access.</strong> Restoring watersheds and forests can improve Ethiopia’s water resources, essential in a country vulnerable to droughts and seasonal variability. It helps ensure more reliable access to water for communities and agriculture.</li><li><strong>Climate resilience and carbon sequestration.</strong> The country's updated <a href=\"https://ndcpartnership.org/country/eth\" target=\"_blank\">Nationally Determined Contributions</a> (NDCs) and <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/ETHIOPIA_%20LONG%20TERM%20LOW%20EMISSION%20AND%20CLIMATE%20RESILIENT%20DEVELOPMENT%20STRATEGY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Long-Term Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development Strategy</a> (LT-LEDS) recognize forest protection and landscape restoration as key pillars of its climate action.  </li><li><strong>Livelihoods.</strong> Programs like the GLI have already created thousands of jobs and will continue to provide sustainable employment opportunities in restoration activities and related industries.</li><li><strong>Economic development.</strong> Landscape restoration in Ethiopia presents an opportunity to mitigate the billions of dollars in annual economic costs of land degradation. It also helps long-term sustainable growth and reduces the need for costly disaster relief efforts.</li></ul><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-left \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"898\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"791\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"606\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"477\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"286\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A seedling production site in Ethiopia. \" height=\"286\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/a-seedling-production-site-in-ethiopia-photo-tsion-issayas-wri.jpg?VersionId=Ov2VNI.1LhEgnb4aJ1NvL1X2uCejqnZj&itok=5Smkv2rV\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A seedling production site in Ethiopia.

These insights into the scale and severity of degradation were key to demonstrating the need for a dedicated special restoration fund.  </p></div><h3>Stable Financing: The Next Step in Ethiopia’s Restoration</h3><p>The new Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration Special Fund marks a significant step in Ethiopia’s restoration journey. Until now, the Green Legacy Initiative relied on regular federal and regional support without a dedicated budget. By institutionalizing the special fund, Ethiopia aims to ensure the long-term sustainability of its landscape restoration efforts while creating opportunities to mobilize additional resources and scale up restoration initiatives nationwide.</p><p>The government aims to leverage these resources to attract investment in restoration beyond federal contributions — including from regional governments, development partners, civil society organizations and private sector actors. This could help scale efforts even further, far beyond what public funds alone can support.</p><p>By demonstrating how national resources can be mobilized and institutionalized to support long-term landscape restoration, Ethiopia is setting a precedent that others could follow. This new model of restoration financing not only strengthens regional collaboration, but also accelerates collective progress toward land restoration and climate resilience in Africa’s most vulnerable landscapes. </p>",

      "description": "<p>Imagine living in a country where everyone has access to clean, affordable public transportation to reach their jobs, schools and healthcare needs without relying on polluting fossil fuels. That vision isn’t too far from where India hopes to be by 2047.</p><p>With an urban population of <a href=\"https://itdp.in/where-does-india-stand-in-its-public-e-bus-transition/\">more than 470 million</a>, India has set an ambitious goal of becoming energy independent by its 100th year of independence. This goal is not just about becoming self-sufficient for its energy needs, but ensuring it’s done in a way that reduces climate-harming emissions and becomes increasingly reliant on clean energy sources.  </p><p>Around 60% of India’s 1.4 billion population is expected to live in its cities by 2050, and with more than <a href=\"https://connectkaro.org/2024/10/03/open-e-bus-blueprint\">one in four people using buses daily</a>, one key way to achieve energy independence is by expanding bus networks into India’s smaller cities.</p><p>India currently faces a major shortfall in urban bus services, especially in smaller cities. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs <a href=\"https://mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/Service_level.pdf\">recommends 60 buses per 100,000 people</a>, yet many cities have fewer than 10. Nationally, only about <a href=\"https://asrtu.org/resource/front/uploads/STUs%20Fleet%20Book%202024.pdf\">47,650 buses serve its urban residents</a>. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities (like Delhi and Mumbai), which represent only a quarter of India’s urban population. In contrast, <a href=\"https://shaktifoundation.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Annex-1-National-Investment-program-for-bus-based-public-transport-systems-in-India.pdf#page=31.07\">cities with populations between 300,000 and 4 million remain largely underserved</a>, with many lacking organized public bus systems. Closing this gap is critical to ensure that growing cities outside of megacities, have access to reliable, inclusive and sustainable transit.</p><p>Well-established electric bus networks, which can complement the country’s rail networks and citywide metro systems, can play a massive and cost-effective role.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"853\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1280\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"506\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"New electric buses are lined up in several rows.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/new-electric-buses-india_0.jpg?VersionId=saqAVspxkGz35oVlAhDUEL0yBow9_oKd&itok=zHRz04g9\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Expanding electric buses to smaller cities will help India meet its goal to be energy independent by 2047. Photo by WRI India.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Why Electric Buses — and Why Now</h3><p>India’s government first announced <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1693893\">financial support to cities for over 20,000 buses</a> in 2021 as a part of its Union (national) budget. However, at the time, this support was limited to the procurement of traditional gas- or diesel-fueled buses due to lower operational costs in 2021. Among India’s transport sector, <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=102799#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20All%20India,UVs)%20and%203%2Dwheelers.\">which consumes nearly 70% of India’s diesel</a>, buses already account for nearly 10% of it.</p><p>As lower costs were realized in electric bus operations, a new strategy was adopted in August 2023 by India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs that prioritized electric buses with equity, sustainability and efficiency of India’s bus system. <a href=\"https://mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/PM-eBus-Sewa-Guidelines-Part-I.pdf\">The PM-eBus Sewa Scheme</a> allocated $2.4 billion to deploy and operate 10,000 electric buses across 169 cities. This program also extends beyond the typical one-time financial assistance for bus purchases and assists with operational costs for 10 years as part of a public-private partnership model that includes bus depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure.</p><p>India’s government then <a href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-pm-electric-drive-revolution-in-innovative-vehicle-enhancement-pm-e-drive-scheme-with-an-outlay-of-rs-10900-crore-over-a-period-of-two-years/\">approved the scheme</a> in September 2024, which included incentives for more than 14,000 electric buses across nine major cities with populations exceeding 4 million people.</p><p>Currently, 10,000 electric buses have been deployed in more than 50 cities and 20,000 electric buses are in various stages of procurement.  </p><p>This brings the current commitment to 30,000 electric buses, a significant step toward cleaner urban transport. To fully realize India's 2047 vision for energy independence and sustainable mobility, continued expansion and strategic deployment of an even larger electric bus fleet will be crucial, particularly in bridging service gaps in smaller cities.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Buses crowd into a Karnataka bus station.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/crowded-bangalore-bus-station_0.jpg?VersionId=B1xaiyeNeiuBhx0_2_ZE1SQzvTNCcgrD&itok=_s8m11N9\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Buses crowd into a Bengaluru station during morning rush hour. Sixty-one percent of India's buses serve just nine megacities. Photo by iStock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>To develop a more inclusive and effective electric bus program, emerging economies can learn from India's experience in expanding electric bus networks to smaller cities while balancing developmental and sustainability goals:</p><h4>Creating Inclusive Access</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>In India and many developing countries, infrastructure investments tend to concentrate in the largest cities. While this may improve conditions within those metros, it can deepen disparities with smaller urban areas that receive less attention.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>By targeting underserved smaller and medium-sized cities, resources can be divided more equitably. For example, the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme promotes more geographically balanced economic development and expands access to essential services.</p><p>Research shows that countries with a strong system of secondary cities tend to experience lower regional disparities — and <a href=\"https://www.citiesalliance.org/newsroom/news/cities-alliance-news/top-ten-reasons-focus-secondary-cities\">higher national productivity</a> — offering lessons for fast growing nations like India.  </p><p>Another way to apply an equity lens to transit investments is by looking at economic opportunities for women. Women make up 48% of the population in cities eligible under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme yet often face limited transportation options. Electric buses offer safer, cleaner and more affordable mobility.</p><p>To reassure the safety of public buses and encourage more female ridership, operator contracts now include a minimum target of 25% female representation in the workforce. As one female electric bus driver from Mumbai noted: “If a woman is driving an e-bus, then more women passengers are encouraged to travel by the bus.”</p><p>The initial rollout of 10,000 electric buses is estimated to generate between 45,000 and 55,000 new jobs. Greater gender parity among electric bus staff can also broaden women’s employment options while improving rider confidence — especially for women who travel alone.</p><h4>Extending Financial Support to Operational Expenses</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>Cities often struggle to cover the operational expenses required for reliable electric bus service. In fact, many public transit agencies struggle to recover full operating costs.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>Extending grants to cover operating costs was a key part of the success behind the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme. It extended financial support beyond capital expenditure to include operational expenses, infrastructure upgrades such as charging stations and technological platforms for smoother operations. This resulted in more efficient and reliable bus networks, while ensuring sustainability of their long-term operations.</p><h4>Reducing Financial Risks</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>Many bus operators are small — owning fewer than 100 vehicles — and have lower credit ratings, which translates to higher interest rates, higher costs and the potential of payment defaults. Under the current Gross Cost Contract model, operators bear the burden of upfront capital cost of electric buses for public transit agencies with monthly payments.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>Extending payment security mechanisms can boost the confidence to bus operators and manufacturers that they’ll receive timely payments from public transit agencies. The PM-ebus Sewa Scheme introduced a <a href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-pm-ebus-sewa-payment-security-mechanism-psm-scheme-for-procurement-and-operation-of-e-buses-by-public-transport-authorities/\">Payment Security Fund</a> that will make interim payments through an implementing agency in case of defaults by the public transit agencies.</p><h4>Building Institutional Capacity</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>The nationwide rollout of electric buses is a significant undertaking requiring collaboration across departments, ministries, transportation authorities and private stakeholders. New tools, skills and capabilities, due to the nascent stage of the industry, will be needed. Meanwhile, it’s further challenged by the varying levels of knowledge and awareness throughout the government.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>Capacity building and knowledge sharing focused on how to address new technologies, maintenance and infrastructure upgrades should be prioritized in the development and implementation of electric bus programs. Developing standards can help streamline this work.  WRI India collaborated with the government of India to develop the PM-ebus Sewa Scheme, establishing guidelines for deployment and a framework for demand aggregation to ensure uniform bus specifications, data standards, operational performance, procurement processes, payment guarantees, infrastructure evaluation, and safety standards. A project management unit within the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs was also created to implement and monitor the program, along with a dedicated team with specialized expertise that will facilitate smoother and more efficient roll out of the electric buses over the next two years, paving the way for expansion of the program beyond 2026.  </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Electric Buses in India are lined up at a charging station.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/electric-buses-charging-station-india_0.jpg?VersionId=Fi7XyLtsZXcSUbnaNYVFutaGQHWY5W0v&itok=mnEbC4Tv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Electric buses are lined up at a charging station in Lucknow, India.

These are cities that have historically lacked organized, affordable and clean public transit options. The adoption of electric buses will reduce dependence on fossil fuels and could reduce millions of tons of emissions over a decade, based on lifecycle estimates. Moreover, expanding the public transport network will grant better access to education, health services and jobs — outcomes that matter most in smaller urban areas where walkability and job density are lower.</p><p>However, the successful adoption of electric buses on a nationwide level requires concerted efforts that overcome challenges including financing, declining transit ridership, and grid resiliency and capacity.</p><p>In countries like India, where a majority of buses are owned by small-scale operators owning less than 100 buses, the higher cost of electric buses poses financial hurdles. Solutions could include demand aggregation to take advantage of economies of scale while purchasing electric -buses and establishing more conducive financing and lending ecosystems for small operators.</p><p>In addition, the mere deployment of more buses will not be enough. With <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e9c8cfe-6d31-4201-b807-8d304e1e4fa9\">public transit ridership remaining stagnant</a> globally over the past decade, cities must leverage technology and data to improve planning, routing and scheduling of buses to improve reliability and encourage behavior change among passengers. Moreover, bus network expansion must be paired with improved last-mile connectivity, including safer pedestrian infrastructure and better street design — especially in smaller cities, where these supporting systems are often weakest.</p><p>Lastly, an increase in electric buses means an increase in electricity demand. However, India is still largely dependent on fossil fuels for its electricity generation, with only <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/india-renewable-energy\">25% of its electricity produced from non-fossil fuel sources.</a> As a result, while electric buses play a critical role in reducing tail pipe emission, to ensure a reduction in total emissions, a larger part of the electric grid must be fueled by renewable sources, a transition process that is still likely to take decades.  </p><h3>The Road Ahead</h3><p>Over the past three years, India has laid the foundation to scale electric bus adoption. The PM-eBus Sewa Scheme advances cleaner, more inclusive mobility by focusing on underserved cities, women’s employment and long-term reforms.</p><p>To deliver on its promise, continued investment in planning, grid upgrades and local capacity is essential — ensuring electric buses support both development and climate goals. WRI India, in an effort to continue this momentum, is working to expand the scheme to 50,000 electric buses nationwide by 2027. To truly reshape India’s mobility landscape, this expansion must continue to focus on smaller cities — where the gaps are greatest and the opportunity for inclusive development is the strongest. With the right mix of policy, investment and local capacity, India’s electric bus transition can redefine public mobility — not only for megacities, but for every city on its growth journey.</p><p><em>WRI India’s </em><a href=\"https://wri-india.org/profile/chintan-daftardar\"><em>Chintan Daftardar</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://wri-india.org/profile/aparna-vijaykumar\"><em>Aparna Vijaykumar</em></a><em>, and </em><a href=\"https://wri-india.org/profile/avinash-dubedi\"><em>Avinash Dubedi</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p><p><em>This article is a part of WRI’s  </em><a href=\"https://wrirosscities.org/our-work/project-city/fedex-embarq-mobility-and-accessibility-program\"><em>Mobility and Accessibility Program</em></a><em>, which enhances global mass transit via local capacity building and action.

(May 21, 2025) </strong>— Global forest loss surged to record highs in 2024, driven by a catastrophic rise in fires, according to new data from the University of Maryland’s GLAD Lab, made available on World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch platform. Loss of tropical primary forests alone reached 6.7 million hectares — nearly twice as much as in 2023 and an area nearly the size of Panama, at the rate of 18 soccer fields every minute.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">For the first time on our record, fires — not agriculture — were the leading cause of tropical primary forest loss, accounting for nearly 50% of all destruction. This marks a dramatic shift from recent years, when fires averaged just 20%. Meanwhile, tropical primary forest loss driven by other causes also jumped by 14%, the sharpest increase since 2016. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Despite some positive developments, particularly in Southeast Asia, the overall trend is heading in a troubling direction. Leaders of over 140 countries signed the </span><a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230418175226/https:/ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Glasgow Leaders Declaration in 2021</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">, promising to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030. But we are alarmingly off track to meet this commitment: Of the 20 countries with the largest area of primary forest, 17 have higher primary forest loss today than when the agreement was signed.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The consequences of forest loss in 2024 have been devastating for both people and the planet. Globally, the fires emitted 4.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions — releasing more than 4 times the emissions from all air travel in 2023. The fires worsened air quality, strained water supplies and threatened the lives and livelihoods of millions.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Elizabeth Goldman, Co-Director, WRI’s Global Forest Watch said:</strong> \"This level of forest loss is unlike anything we've seen in over 20 years of data. It's a global red alert — a collective call to action for every country, every business and every person who cares about a livable planet. Our economies, our communities, our health — none of it can survive without forests.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">While fires are natural in some ecosystems, those in tropical forests are mostly human-caused, often set on agricultural land or to prepare new areas for farming. In 2024, the hottest year on record, extreme conditions fueled by climate change and El Niño made these fires more intense and harder to control. Although forests have the ability to recover from fire, the combined pressures of land conversion and a changing climate can hinder that recovery and raise the likelihood of future fires.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Top Countries for Forest Loss</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Brazil, the country with the largest area of tropical forest, accounted for 42% of all tropical primary forest loss in 2024. Fires, fueled by the worst drought on record, caused 66% of that loss — an over sixfold increase from 2023. Primary forest loss from other causes also rose by 13%, mostly due to large-scale farming for soy and cattle, though still lower than the peaks seen in the early 2000s and in the Bolsonaro era. The Amazon experienced its highest tree cover loss since 2016, while the Pantanal suffered the highest percentage of tree cover loss in the country.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Mariana Oliveira, Director Forests and Land Use Program, WRI Brasil said: </strong>“Brazil has made progress under President Lula — but the threat to forests remains. Without sustained investment in community fire prevention, stronger state-level enforcement and a focus on sustainable land use, hard-won gains risk being undone. As Brazil prepares to host COP30, it has a powerful opportunity to put forest protection front and center on the global stage.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Bolivia's primary forest loss skyrocketed by 200% in 2024, totaling 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres). For the first time, it ranked second for tropical primary forest loss only to Brazil, overtaking the Democratic Republic of Congo despite having less than half its forest area. More than half the loss was due to fires, often set to clear land for soy, cattle, and sugarcane, which turned into megafires due to heavy drought. Government policies promoting agricultural expansion worsened the problem.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Stasiek Czaplicki Cabezas, Bolivian researcher and Data Journalist for Revista Nomadas, said:</strong> “The fires that tore through Bolivia in 2024 left deep scars — not only on the land, but on the people who depend on it. The damage could take centuries to undo. Across the tropics, we need stronger fire response systems and a shift away from policies that encourage dangerous land clearing, or this pattern of destruction will only get worse.\" </span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In Colombia, primary forest loss increased by nearly 50%. However, unlike elsewhere in Latin America, fires were not the primary cause. Instead, non-fire-related loss rose by 53%, owing to instability from the breakdown in peace talks, including illegal mining and coca production.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Joaquin Carrizosa, Senior Advisor, WRI Colombia said: </strong>“In 2023, Colombia saw the biggest drop in primary forest loss in 20 years, proving that when government and communities work together, real change is possible. The rise in primary forest loss in 2024 is a setback, but it shouldn’t discourage us as a country. We need to keep supporting local, nature-based economies – especially in remote areas – and invest in solutions that protect the environment, create jobs and foster peace.\"</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In 2024, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo (ROC) saw the highest levels of primary forest loss on record. In the ROC, primary forest loss surged by 150% compared to the previous year, with fires causing 45% of the damage, worsened by unusually hot and dry conditions. Like the Amazon, the Congo Basin plays a crucial role as a carbon sink, but the rising fires and forest loss now threaten its vital function. In the DRC, poverty, reliance on forests for food and energy and ongoing conflict driven by rebel groups have fueled instability and led to increased land clearing, further driving forest loss.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Teodyl Nkuintchua, Congo Basin Strategy & Engagement Lead, WRI Africa said:</strong> “The high rates of forest loss in the DRC reflect the tough realities our communities are facing — poverty, conflict and a deep reliance on forests for survival. There’s no silver bullet, but we won't change the current trajectory until people across the Congo Basin are fully empowered to lead conservation efforts that also support their rural economies.”</span></em> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Dr. Matt Hansen, Professor, University of Maryland; Co-Director, Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) Lab said: </strong>\"We’re seeing unprecedented forest loss from fire in the few remaining ‘High Forest, Low Deforestation’ countries, like the Republic of Congo. This new dynamic is outside of current policy frameworks or intervention capabilities and will severely test our ability to maintain intact forests within a warming climate.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">However, it's not all bad news. In Southeast Asia, there are signs of progress. Indonesia reduced primary forest loss by 11%, reversing a steady rise between 2021 and 2023. Efforts under former President Joko Widodo to restore land and curb fires helped keep fire rates low, even amid widespread droughts. Similarly, Malaysia saw a 13% decline and fell out of the top 10 countries for tropical primary forest loss for the first time.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Arief Wijaya, Managing Director, WRI Indonesia said</strong>: “We're proud that Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world to reduce primary forest loss. But deforestation remains a concern due to plantations, small-scale farming and mining — even within protected areas. We hope the current administration keeps the momentum going\". </span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The rise in forest loss also extended beyond the tropics. The world saw a 5% increase in total tree cover loss compared to 2023, adding up to 30 million hectares — an area the size of Italy. This increase was driven in part by the intense fire seasons in Canada and Russia, marking the first time that major fires raged across both the tropics and boreal forests since GFW’s record-keeping began.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Combatting Forest Loss</strong></span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Peter Potapov, Research Professor, University of Maryland; Co-Director, Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) Lab said: </strong>\"2024 was the worst year on record for fire-driven forest loss, breaking the record set just last year. If this trend continues, it could permanently transform critical natural areas and unleash large amounts of carbon — intensifying climate change and fueling even more extreme fires. This is a dangerous feedback loop we cannot afford to trigger further.\"</span></em> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Rod Taylor, Director, Forests and Nature Conservation, WRI said</strong>: “Forest fires and land clearing are driving up emissions, while the climate is already changing faster than forests can adapt. This crisis is pushing countless species to the brink and forcing Indigenous Peoples and local communities from their ancestral lands. But this isn’t irreversible — if governments, businesses, and individuals act now, we can stop the assault on forests and their custodians.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To meet the global goal of halting forest loss by 2030, the world must reduce deforestation by 20% every year, starting immediately. In contrast, 2024 marked an 80% increase in tropical primary forest loss. To combat this loss, the world needs action on multiple fronts: stronger fire prevention, deforestation-free supply chains for commodities, better enforcement of trade regulations and increased funding for forest protection — especially Indigenous-led initiatives.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Achieving this will require political will, national strategies tailored to local realities and greater support from wealthier nations to ensure forests remain standing — and are valued more alive than lost.</span> <br /><br /><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Kelly Levin, Chief of Science, Data and Systems Change, Bezos Earth Fund said:</strong></span></em><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Countries have repeatedly pledged to halt deforestation and forest degradation. Yet the data reveal a stark gap between promises made and progress delivered — alongside the growing impacts of a warming world. These findings should jolt us out of complacency. The Bezos Earth Fund is proud to support this vital tool for showing where we stand and ensuring action is grounded in evidence.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>About the annual Tree Cover Loss data analysis </strong></span> <br /><span lang=\"EN-US\">World Resource Institute’s Global Forest Watch provides annual tree cover loss data analysis, showing when and where forest loss occurred around the world.

      "title": "Adaptation Finance: 10 Key Questions, Answered",
      "link": "https://www.wri.org/insights/adaptation-finance-explained",
      "pubDate": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:00:00 EDT",
      "description": "<p>People around the world are feeling the effects of climate change in the form of severe floods, long-term droughts, worsening forest fires, intensifying storms, extreme heat and more. It's essential that communities invest in reducing and avoiding these impacts. For example, improved building methods can be the difference between a house withstanding a storm or crumbling to rubble.</p><p>The critical question is: How do we pay for it?</p><p>This is where <strong>adaptation finance</strong> comes in.</p><p>Particularly in low-income countries, adaptation finance is sorely needed to help make people — and the infrastructure and ecosystems they rely on — more resilient to the impacts of climate change. Yet with each passing year the gap between the adaptation finance needed and what is available grows.</p><p>Closing this gap is essential as climate change continues to escalate. But there are varying definitions about what counts as adaptation finance, as well as different means of providing and tracking funds. Here, we answer key questions:</p><h3>1) What Is Adaptation Finance?</h3><p>Adaptation finance is aimed at helping communities reduce the risks they face and harm they might suffer from climate hazards like storms or droughts. It pays for things like strengthening housing and infrastructure to withstand extreme weather; developing drought-tolerant crops; creating social safety nets (like cash, food or insurance to help with recovery from climate-related disasters); or improving access to climate information for better management of climate-related risks.</p><p>Adaptation finance includes funds flowing from developed to developing countries as well as finance that governments — in both developing and developed countries — invest to build resilience to climate impacts within their own borders. Adaptation finance can also come from private sources, such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/philanthropy-adaptation-finance-developing-countries\">philanthropies</a>, corporations and financial institutions. Businesses are increasingly investing in adaptation to protect their operations, supply chains and markets from exposure to climate-related risks.</p><p>Adaptation finance often overlaps with development finance, as investments aimed at reducing communities' economic or social vulnerability often also enhance resilience to climate change, in addition to other benefits. However, for funding to be classified as adaptation finance, it must be explicitly intended to enhance <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction\">resilience to actual or expected climate risks</a>.</p><p>For example, funding a new road may boost a community's resilience by making it easier for people to access markets, hospitals and assistance during extreme weather. To count as adaptation finance, however, the road needs to be deliberately built with climate impacts and the needs of vulnerable people in mind. A vulnerability analysis could reveal the need for a more durable road so people living in informal settlements can safely evacuate ahead of severe storms. And the road would need to be situated where it will not be directly exposed to storm surges and erosion, or elevated so that it remains passable when flooding occurs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cars on a partially submerged highway after a flood.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/typhoon-yagi_0.jpg?VersionId=Svwj3PbQmymQnTxB6Z6e7rF.FfCtehjt&itok=UJVRTL2A\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A partially submerged highway in Thailand's Chiang Rai province following Typhoon Yagi in 2024. Adaptation finance pays for activities that enhance resilience to climate impacts, such as building elevated or more durable roads that can better withstand floods and storms.

For example, the <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024\">UNEP Adaptation Finance GAP Report</a> estimates that developing countries need between $215 and $387 billion per year by 2030. The <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change#:~:text=Research%20by%20the%20IMF%20and,per%20year%20in%20coming%20decades.\">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) estimates that adaptation costs exceed 1% of GDP per year in about 50 low-income and developing economies. This rises up to 20% of GDP for small island nations exposed to acute climate hazards such as tropical cyclones and rising seas.</p><p>However, these are only broad estimates. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact amount of adaptation finance needed, as this requires assessing context-specific risks, clearly distinguishing adaptation from general development, and more accurate data collection. Uncertainties about future climate trajectories also complicate estimates, as adaptation finance needs depend in part on how successful we are at curbing global temperature rise.</p><h3>3) How Much Adaptation Finance Is Available?</h3><p>Even with fairly limited data, it's clear there's not enough adaptation finance available to meet countries' needs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2024/\">Climate Policy Initiativ</a>e (CPI) estimates that $68 billion was spent around the world on adaptation on average between 2021 and 2022. Much of this was international finance: According to <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/286dae5d-en/1/3/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/286dae5d-en&_csp_=46b868d4f630525e4ccc5f67e501847f&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book\">OECD</a>, developed countries delivered $32.4 billion in adaptation finance to developing nations in 2022.</p><p>These funding levels are many times less than what's needed — and the gap is set to increase as climate change impacts intensify. In total, the gap between current adaptation finance and what's needed in developing countries is estimated at <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/46497/AGR2024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\">$187-$359 billion per year</a>.</p><h3>4) Who Is — and Is not — Receiving Adaptation Finance?</h3><p>Evidence shows that available finance is not reaching those most vulnerable to climate impacts, who often have the fewest resources with which to adapt. According to <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-new-collective-quantified-goal-on-climate-finance_7b28309b-en.html\">OECD</a>, low-income countries received less than 10% of all climate finance provided and mobilized by developed countries between 2016 and 2022. Data from the four major multilateral climate funds — Adaptation Fund, Climate Investment Fund, Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility — also indicates that fragile and highly vulnerable countries <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/publications/climate-finance-sustaining-peace-making-climate-finance-work-conflict-affected-and-fragile-contexts\">are receiving less finance</a> than other nations.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21596160/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>One potential reason for this is that accessing adaptation finance often requires significant institutional capacity. While funding requirements vary based on the type of finance involved, they are often complex, requiring the staff, data and know-how to structure bankable adaptation initiatives. Least developed countries often lack these resources, despite having the highest need for adaptation finance. High costs of capital, driven by factors like currency and political risks, further limit access to finance.</p><h3>5) Why Does Climate Mitigation Receive More Funding than Adaptation?</h3><p>While adaptation finance has increased in recent years, it still represents <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf\">less than 10%</a> of global climate investments. The majority goes to climate change mitigation: efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and halt rising temperatures.</p><p>There are several reasons why mitigation receives more finance than adaptation. Mitigation's focus on GHG emissions not only makes it easier to define, it also makes it easier to invest in. Activities like installing solar panels or manufacturing electric vehicles bring a more immediate and certain financial return than many adaptation initiatives, which focus on building long-term resilience to extreme events that may happen further in the future. Nations may also be more inclined to invest in mitigation internationally given the contribution to global emissions reductions.</p><h3>6) Why Is Adaptation Finance Difficult to Track?</h3><p>Adaptation finance can be tricky to define and track, in large part because adaptation is highly context specific. Unlike mitigation finance, which targets a narrower set of solutions to reduce GHG emissions, adaptation requires a broad array of activities tailored to particular climate risks faced by specific locations.</p><p>There are also varying methods for tracking adaptation finance. Two of the most widely used approaches — <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/environment-development/Revised%20climate%20marker%20handbook_FINAL.pdf\">OECD DAC Rio Markers</a> and <a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/20cd787e947dbf44598741469538a4ab-0020012022/original/20220242-mdbs-joint-methodology-climate-change-adaptation-finance-en.pdf\">MDB Joint Methodology for Tracking Adaptation Finance</a> — offer guidance to financial institutions and countries providing adaptation finance. While their methodologies differ somewhat, both focus on identifying whether an investment has supported climate resilience, and if so, to what degree.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/colombias-climate-finance-tracking-system-registers-6-billion-worth-action\">Some countries</a> have developed their own approaches to tracking adaptation finance and budget expenditures. These often draw from the two methodologies mentioned above but make modifications to suit national circumstances. As a result, adaptation finance provided or received by countries is not always easily comparable.</p><p>Even with methodologies in place, tracking adaptation finance is complicated. It requires funding and capacity to execute, which organizations aren't always resourced for. Moreover, spending on adaptation may occur across different units of the organization, creating a cross-cutting challenge requiring additional coordination.</p><p>Adaptation finance from the private sector is even more difficult to track because, unlike public funding, governments do not maintain centralized accounting systems for private investments. As a result, virtually no country systematically monitors how much private funding is spent on adaptation within or outside its borders.</p><h3>7) Are Developing Countries Receiving Financial Support for Adaptation?</h3><p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) governs the process by which countries come together to cooperate on climate action. Under the UNFCCC, developed countries committed to help developing countries — which contributed least to the climate crisis but often suffer the worst impacts — finance their adaptation efforts.</p><p>This commitment has led to the adoption of key climate funds (such as the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund) to channel international finance to developing countries. Developed countries also agreed under the UNFCCC to double adaptation finance from 2019 levels to roughly $40 billion by 2025. <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-in-2013-2022_19150727-en/full-report/component-2.html#chapter-d1e103-47ec524116\">As of 2022</a> (the latest data available), they had reached $32.4 billion, putting them on track to realize this goal.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Farmers among the plots of a community garden.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/climate-adaptation-farmers-gambia_0.jpg?VersionId=PR5jMfF98tm6Z.ipLo0vneTPFIMry_hg&itok=aFUEAJVB\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>In Gambia, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) helps farmers develop methods that are more resilient to climate impacts like rising temperatures and erratic rainfall. International support is an important source of funding for developing nations to pursue climate adaptation. Photo by UNEP/Flickr</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Most recently, at the 2024 UN climate summit (COP29), countries agreed to a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ncqg-climate-finance-goals-explained\">New Collective Quantified Goal</a> (NCQG) on climate finance. Parties committed to deliver $300 billion — with efforts to reach $1.3 trillion — for climate action in developing countries by 2035, aiming for a balance between mitigation and adaptation finance. The NCQG also acknowledges the need to improve the quality of adaptation finance, particularly the need for grant-based resources and highly concessional (affordable) finance that does not exacerbate existing debt burdens.</p><h3>8) How Much Adaptation Finance Comes from the Private Sector?</h3><p>While private sector finance for adaptation is especially difficult to track, the data that is available shows it's particularly limited. For example, of the climate finance that the CPI has been able to track, <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf\">approximately 90%</a> of adaptation finance was provided through public actors.</p><p>There are several reasons for this. Adaptation projects often bring broad social benefits, but clear financial returns for private investors may be difficult to discern. Many vulnerable communities are also located in areas perceived as too risky for private investment, including areas suffering from conflict or other forms of instability. Other times, private investments in resilience are not made simply due to uncertainty about which adaptation options to invest in or a lack of long-term planning, technical capacity and data.</p><p>Private investment in adaptation needs to be scaled up, as public funding alone will not be enough to close the adaptation finance gap and meet the large and growing need for climate resilience. Private companies finance, build and maintain vital infrastructure, supply chains and markets. It is essential that they integrate climate resilience into their investment decisions and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/private-sector-climate-adaptation-finance\">explore innovative financial instruments</a> to expand collaboration with the public sector. Governments can help by creating incentives and risk-sharing mechanisms to accelerate private investments in adaptation-related activities.</p><h3>9) How Is Adaptation Finance Being Provided?</h3><p>The majority — <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf\">around 76%</a> — of adaptation finance to emerging market and developing economies (excluding least developed countries) is provided in the form of non-concessional finance. Least developed countries, for their part, tend to receive a majority of their funding in the form of grants. Some countries have opted to turn down loans for climate-related activities to avoid adding further debt to their balance sheets. Any efforts to scale up adaptation finance should also aim to ensure that the right type of funding is matched with the right types of projects.</p><h3>10) What Is the Relationship between Adaptation Finance and Finance for Loss and Damage?</h3><p>Funding for <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loss-damage-climate-change\">\"loss and damage\"</a> — climate impacts that go beyond what people can adapt to — is an important discussion point in climate negotiations. Finance for loss and damage and for adaptation are closely related, as both aim to help communities deal with the costs associated with climate impacts. The main difference between the two is that adaptation finance is intended to help communities <em>prepare for and reduce potential impacts</em>, while loss and damage finance primarily pays for <em>losses that occur despite investments in resilience</em>. Investing in climate adaptation can help reduce loss and damage costs down the line.</p><h3>Next Steps for Scaling Adaptation Finance</h3><p>Growing adaptation finance will require stronger political commitments and more institutional capacity in both the public and private sectors. Better data on the economic and social risks posed by climate change, as well as on the financial and economic returns of adaptation projects, is also essential to increasing investments. This information would help countries, donors and the private sector agree on adaptation priorities, track adaptation finance and integrate adaptation priorities into national planning.</p><p>The 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil presents a crucial opportunity to elevate the case for adaptation finance, building on recent momentum to secure stronger commitments and bridge the global finance gap. In Belém, the current and previous COP hosts will present a roadmap for reaching the NCQG's $1.3 trillion target, which parties hope will provide clear guidance on scaling up adaptation finance. Negotiators will also decide on a set of indicators to track progress on the Paris Agreement's <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-goal-on-adaptation-explained\">Global Goal on Adaptation</a>. Including credible finance-related indicators will be essential for holding parties accountable to their adaptation goals and driving real change for those on the front lines of the climate crisis.</p><p>At COP30 and beyond, countries must scale up adaptation finance to support those already affected by climate change and prepare for the impacts yet to come. Doing so is a strategic investment that, via broad social, economic and environmental benefits, will contribute to global stability and prosperity.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The past few years have seen increased global attention and investment in carbon capture technology as a way to capture the emissions causing climate change before they enter the atmosphere. Policies like the EU's <a href=\"https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/industry/sustainability/net-zero-industry-act_en\">Net Zero Industry Act</a>, the <a href=\"https://carboncapturecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45Q-primer-Carbon-Capture-Coalition.pdf\">45Q tax credit</a> in the U.S. and Denmark's <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/policies/14803-danish-ccus-fund\">CCUS Fund</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/indonesia-unveils-ccs-regulations-to-spur-industry-growth/\">emerging regulation</a> in Indonesia, are all helping to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS).</p><p>Yet even as the pipeline of CCUS projects grows year over year, progress remains far below what climate models indicate is needed due to stubbornly high costs, regulatory challenges, and insufficient policy and financial support.</p><p>Today CCUS captures around 0.1% of global emissions — around <a href=\"https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Global-Status-Report-6-November.pdf\">50 million metric tons</a> of carbon dioxide (CO2). Climate scenarios that limit warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), show CCUS capturing around 1 billion metric tons of CO2 by 2030 and several billions of tons by 2050.</p><p>But not everyone sees CCUS as part of the climate solution. While certain countries are moving ahead with CCUS deployment, others are skeptical of its use. Some <a href=\"https://www.ciel.org/organizations-demand-policymakers-reject-carbon-capture-and-storage/\">NGOs</a> and <a href=\"https://climatejusticealliance.org/ccus-is-not-a-real-solution/\">other stakeholders</a> oppose CCUS, arguing that it creates a moral hazard and that it's only a band-aid over what they see as the real problem: ending use of fossil fuels. They point to a mixed record of success, high costs, and the potential for disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities among reasons to not rely on the technology.</p><p>This article addresses key questions around the role of CCUS, including where the technology is today, in which sectors it will be most useful, and how much of the total mitigation need it can provide to help meet global climate targets.</p><h3>1) What Is Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS)?</h3><p>Carbon capture technology combined with utilization (sometimes referenced as \"use\") or <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-carbon-sequestration\">sequestration</a> (sometimes referenced as \"storage\") is a way to reduce CO2 from emissions sources (such as power plants or industrial facilities) using <a href=\"https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/resources/publications-reports-research/technologycompendium2024/\">different technologies</a> that separate CO2 from the other gases coming out of a facility. The CO2 is thus captured before entering the atmosphere. Then it is either permanently stored underground or incorporated into certain types of products, such as concrete or chemicals.</p><h3>2) Is Carbon Capture the Same as Carbon Removal?</h3><p>No, CCUS is not the same as carbon removal. While CCUS captures carbon emissions at their source, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/carbon-removal/insights\">carbon dioxide removal </a>(or just \"carbon removal\") removes CO2 that is already in the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removal includes <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-ways-remove-carbon-pollution-sky\">a range of approaches</a>, from familiar things like tree restoration to newer technological approaches, like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\">direct air capture</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/carbon-mineralization-carbon-removal\">carbon mineralization</a>. Another type of carbon removal is bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, where biomass is combusted and carbon capture technology is used to capture those emissions before they enter the atmosphere. Even though this process involves carbon capture at an emissions source, it can result in carbon removal, because the captured CO2 originally came from the air via photosynthesis in the biomass that was combusted.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1725\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1380\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1057\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"832\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"498\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The differences between carbon capture and carbon dioxide removal\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2023-11/23-11-03%20CCS%20v%20CDR_Insights-V2.png?VersionId=b3V2kVCWVwWVbxBQsuZqvg6r5rQYd.5b&itok=EYDfzRzu\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>While CCUS and carbon removal differ on where CO2 is collected, both CCUS and some types of carbon removal require somewhere to sequester the captured CO2.</p><p>Captured CO2 — either from emission sources or from the air — can be pumped underground into certain geological formations where it is permanently sequestered. Or, or it can be used in products ranging from concrete to chemicals to synthetic fuels. If used this way, the duration of sequestration depends on the product: For example, if CO2 is used to produce synthetic fuel, it would be re-emitted when the fuel is combusted. But CO2 used in concrete would be sequestered permanently.</p><p>CCUS is one of many ways to reduce emissions and plays a different role from carbon removal in long-term and net-zero climate plans developed by countries or companies. Emissions reductions — including CCUS and many other options — should make up the vast majority of mitigation in those plans. But carbon removal can be used to counterbalance a much smaller portion of emissions (both CO2 and other greenhouse gases) that are too hard to abate with other means. In the longer term, carbon removal is also needed to achieve and sustain net-negative emissions to reduce the excess CO2 in the atmosphere that is causing harmful climate impacts.</p><p>Notably, the term \"carbon management\" can be used to include both CCUS and carbon removal. This can be misleading, because along with playing different roles in reaching net-zero, CCUS and carbon removal have different risks, benefits and social and environmental impacts.</p><h3>3) Which Sectors Could Use CCUS? Which Sectors Need CCUS the Most to Decarbonize?</h3><p>The two sectors where CCUS could be deployed are power and industry, which represent large \"point sources\" of emissions. Whether it makes sense to use CCUS in those sectors will depend on costs, the feasibility of other decarbonization options, and other project- and location-specific factors.</p><p>In the industrial sector, production of materials such as cement, steel and chemicals will likely need CCUS to fully decarbonize in the near term. This is because other decarbonization approaches do not exist or are in earlier stages of development. Current <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/industry\">production methods</a> for these industrial products include chemical reactions that inherently release CO2, leading to \"<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-why-cement-emissions-matter-for-climate-change/\">process emissions</a>,\" as well as fuel combustion for high temperatures that causes \"thermal emissions.\" CCUS can be used to abate both process emissions and thermal emissions, making it a particularly impactful decarbonization option for industry if scaled.</p><p>While a number of CCUS projects are <a href=\"https://www.industrytransition.org/green-cement-technology-tracker/\">being announced</a> in the industrial sector, the application is still nascent. Heidelberg's cement CCUS project in Brevik, Norway reached mechanical completion <a href=\"https://www.globalcement.com/news/item/18164-heidelberg-materials-brevik-carbon-capture-facility-ready-for-testing-and-commissioning\">in late 2024</a> and will become the world's first commercial-scale carbon capture cement plant when commissioned.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1073\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A cement plant fitted with infrastructure for carbon capture.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/ccus-cement-plant_0.jpg?VersionId=x0LhyxLzwyXLPSbV.p55QtcxjMvXuHp9&itok=diRdSyHO\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Heidelberg's Brevik Norway CCUS cement plant. Photo by NGR Kartheek/WRI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>CCUS can also be used in oil and gas refining (another part of the industrial sector) to reduce emissions associated with the production of fuels used in heavy industries, transportation and power. However, the current rates of oil and gas use are incompatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C, the target set by the Paris Agreement to ensure the world avoids the worst impacts of climate change — and using CCUS on refineries should not be a reason for that to continue. Lowering emissions associated with production does not reduce the emissions from these fuels when they're ultimately combusted.</p><p>Within the power sector, the IPCC and other credible modeling by <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/c036b390-ba9c-4132-870b-ffb455148b63/WorldEnergyOutlook2024.pdf\">IEA</a> and <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/urgent-deployment-of-existing-technology-can-get-world-close-to-net-zero-bloombergnefs-new-energy-outlook-2024-shows/\">BloombergNEF</a> indicate that power plants retrofitted with CCUS are one option for the clean, firm power which can complement solar and wind that are likely to predominantly supply the grid. (Other options for clean, firm power include hydropower, geothermal, hydrogen, nuclear and long-duration storage.) The actual deployment of CCUS will depend in part on its costs when fully commercialized, along with individual country resources and circumstances.</p><p>In these sectors, it's crucial to note that the use of CCUS should not be seen as a license to perpetuate the use of fossil fuels — particularly in the power sector, where many other options are commercially available today. CCUS could play an indispensable role in the industrial sector but isn't a silver bullet. Overall, the use of CCUS will need to be accompanied by a steep decline in the production and use of fossil fuels, along with other decarbonization options to address remaining emissions.</p><h3>4) How Much Carbon Dioxide Is CCUS Currently Capturing?</h3><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Global-Status-Report-6-November.pdf\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/ccus-projects-database\">reports</a> — and depending on the source — there are around 50 operational CCUS projects globally, with about 44 under construction and more than 500 in some stage of planning. Operational projects are capturing about 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year (MtCO2/yr). If all projects in development were complete, estimated total CCUS capacity would be between <a href=\"https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Global-Status-Report-6-November.pdf\">416</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/ccus-projects-explorer\">520</a> MtCO2/yr, which is around 0.9%-1.1% of today's <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?chartType=area&end_year=2020&start_year=1990&ap3c=AGWoPUjYwsW-aScAAGf306HiFeWAfa7iKUa86DHcwL_HgtgvkQ\">global greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p><p>Currently, North America leads in operational projects. Most of these applications are in the natural gas processing and ethanol industries, where capturing CO2 is relatively less expensive than in other subsectors. Other regions, such as Europe and the Middle East, also have a handful of operational projects. And a growing number of new projects have been announced in Europe, East Asia, the Middle East and Oceania/Australia.</p><p>Projects in the development pipeline are increasingly focused on blue hydrogen (where natural gas is used to produce hydrogen and then CO2 emissions are captured), as well as applications in industrial sectors like steel, cement, bioenergy, ammonia and refining.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>5) How Much CCUS Is Needed to Reach Net Zero, and What Portion of the Total Mitigation Need Is This?</h3><p>The IPCC, IEA and others find that CCUS can play a critical but limited role in addressing the climate crisis. Their analyses show that CCUS can be a complementary tool to reduce emissions where eliminating fossil fuel use or other emissions are not feasible.</p><p>The 2023 <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/13dab083-08c3-4dfd-a887-42a3ebe533bc/NetZeroRoadmap_AGlobalPathwaytoKeepthe1.5CGoalinReach-2023Update.pdf\">IEA Roadmap to Net Zero</a> estimates that in order to reach net-zero in the energy sector by 2050, CCUS would need to contribute about 8% of the total CO2 mitigation of energy sector emissions. This includes around 1 gigaton of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030 (out of a total of 15 GtCO2 abated by that date) and 5 GtCO2 in 2050 at net zero. Notably, this roadmap only considers energy-related CO2 emissions — total GHG emissions across all sectors are <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf\">around 59 GtCO2e</a> and need to be roughly halved by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. Considering this fuller picture, the role of CCUS would likely be a smaller percentage of total mitigation.</p><p>The IPCC's <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/\">Sixth Assessment Report</a>, which examined over 200 mitigation scenarios that could limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, found that there are no scenarios in which CCUS would allow continued use of fossil fuels at current levels, let alone expanded oil and gas production. IPCC scenarios show a wide range of potential deployment of carbon capture technology: CCUS applied to fossil fuels reduces CO2 emissions by 0-5 GtCO2 by 2030 with a median of 1 GtCO2. By 2050, that range is 0-13 GtCO2 with a median of 2-3 GtCO2. This means that by 2050, roughly 6% of the mitigation needed to reach net zero could come from CCUS.</p><p>The IPCC recognizes that CCUS faces \"technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers\" such that current rates of CCUS deployment are far below those in most scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees C. At the same time, the number of CCUS projects in the pipeline has increased by several hundred each year. If all of the announced projects come online, capture levels could increase 8 to 10 times over.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>6) What Are the Risks and Concerns Associated with CCUS?</h3><p>Two key concerns around scaling up CCUS technology are: (1) slow adoption of CCUS technology, and (2) a fear that using CCUS will perpetuate the use of fossil fuels and continue negative health and social impacts of emitting facilities.</p><h4>Technological challenges</h4><p>While carbon capture has been in use <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-clean-energy-transitions/a-new-era-for-ccus\">since the 1970s</a> in the U.S. (almost entirely for natural gas processing and for using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery), its adoption has been slow. There are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142152100416X#:~:text=The%20high%20failure%20rate%20of%20projects%20drains%20the%20social%20resources,an%20unsustainable%20cycle%20of%20innovation.\">not many examples</a> to date of its successful application, and <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/ill-fated-petra-nova-ccs-project-nrg-energy-throws-towel\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/billion-dollar-kemper-clean-coal-energy-project-000015/\">high-profile projects</a> have been abandoned or shuttered. Unlike many other clean technologies (such as solar photovoltaic), CCUS systems can't be mass produced because they are specifically designed to match the facility that's capturing the CO2. CCUS projects are also complex to coordinate because each step of the process — capture, transport and sequestration — is often owned and operated by a different company.</p><p>Additionally, each CCUS system has high upfront costs (often <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142152100416X\">upwards of $1 billion</a>) that can be prohibitive for project developers, combined with a riskier revenue structure compared to other clean technologies. However, costs are <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/is-carbon-capture-too-expensive\">expected to decline</a> as more projects come online, the technology improves and financing costs fall.</p><p>Furthermore, today's carbon capture systems do not capture 100% of emissions. Most are <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage\">designed to capture 90%</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00095-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435121000957%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#secsectitle0130\">reported</a> <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/carbon-capture-crux-lessons-learned\">capture rates</a> are lower in some cases. Additional energy is also required to power the capture system — depending on the application it can be <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Chapter_06.pdf#page=40\">13%-44% more</a>. Access to suitable geologic sequestration sites may also be needed, and in some cases, these can be far from capture sites, requiring CO2 transport.</p><p>Transport and geologic sequestration of CO2 present their own risks — mainly of CO2 leakage. While CO2 in high concentrations from a pipeline leak could cause asphyxiation risk under certain circumstances, CO2 is not flammable like leaks from oil and gas pipelines. The environmental and health impacts of potential CO2 leakage are site specific and merit further research and testing to minimize them. Strong regulatory policy is also needed to set high standards for site characterization, monitoring, transparency and emergency response.</p><h4>Concerns about perpetuating fossil fuel use</h4><p>For some groups, a major concern associated with CCUS is its potential <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/article/carbon-capture-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-false-climate-solution\">to lock in fossil power production</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ciel.org/organizations-demand-policymakers-reject-carbon-capture-and-storage/\">other fossil-dependent processes</a>. Associated with this, CCUS can be <a href=\"https://climatejusticealliance.org/ccus-is-not-a-real-solution/\">seen to perpetuate</a> the negative health and environmental impacts caused by emissions intensive facilities — and act as a band-aid over these polluting industries, which disproportionately harm vulnerable communities that have historically borne higher levels of air pollution and toxic emissions.</p><p>Recent research shows that carbon capture systems can <a href=\"https://carboncaptureready.betterenergy.org/analysis/\">reduce</a> (but not eliminate) harmful pollutants. But in many cases, community-based organizations and other advocates would prefer a facility to be shut down and investment to focus instead on cleaner production processes, such as renewables in the power sector.</p><p>In the U.S., where CCUS has recently <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/oced/carbon-capture-large-scale-pilot-programs\">received</a> <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/oced/carbon-capture-demonstration-projects-program\">billions</a> of dollars in government funding, the types of facilities that could be retrofitted with CCUS are often located in communities that have already borne the negative environmental and health impacts of living near power or industrial facilities. While there is evidence that CCUS <a href=\"https://carboncaptureready.betterenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Carbon-Capture-Co-Benefits.pdf\">can help reduce non-CO2 pollutants</a> along with capturing CO2, many environmental justice groups are <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/08/22/down-your-throat-biden-pushes-ccs-on-polluted-places-00110876\">concerned</a> that CCUS is being pushed on them without consultation, and that CCUS will be used as a way to prolong a facility's lifetime and continue the local harms it causes.</p><h3>7) What Are Some Ways to Deploy CCUS Responsibly?</h3><p>Responsible deployment of CCUS technology must focus not only on ensuring that the technology is effective at reducing emissions, but also that its application minimizes harm to people and the environment and maximizes benefits to them.</p><p>Robust governance and regulatory frameworks are needed to facilitate safe and effective deployment of CCUS where it is needed to reach climate goals. Regulatory frameworks should address issues such as permitting, liability and long-term monitoring as well as supportive infrastructure, such as pipelines and pore space ownership, for geologic sequestration sites. Regulatory frameworks should also require strategies to quantify, transparently share and minimize negative environmental and social impacts, such as emission of air pollutants. Some of this work is already underway in the U.S., including guidance to promote responsible development and permitting of CCUS projects and state-level regulatory frameworks, starting with <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/california-carbon-dioxide-removal-policies\">California</a>. In Europe, the European Commission has developed a <a href=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-capture-use-and-storage/legal-framework-safe-geological-storage-carbon-dioxide_en\">CCS Directive</a> that establishes a legal framework for safe and effective geologic sequestration of CO2.</p><p>Any plan to implement CCUS must involve meaningful engagement with and buy-in from the local communities around existing facilities where project developers plan to add CCUS. A critical early step in any community engagement process is understanding community perspectives on the project and sharing information on expected local environmental and health impacts.</p><p>One outcome of this engagement process can be development of a legally binding <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/community-benefits-agreements-us-clean-energy\">community benefits agreement</a>. These agreements lay out specific benefits the community will receive in exchange for supporting a project — such as local jobs or other types of investment. Community benefits plans, which can lead to community benefits agreements, are required in the vast majority of U.S. government funding for carbon capture and carbon removal projects.</p><p>Retrofitting a facility with CCUS does not always make sense as the first decarbonization option for technical and financial reasons. But some CO2 emission sources, particularly those in heavy industry (such as cement process emissions), have few other options. Generally, from an economic standpoint, it makes sense <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-clean-energy-transitions/ccus-in-the-transition-to-net-zero-emissions\">to focus CCUS technology</a> on facilities that are younger, efficient, and located near suitable options for CO2 sequestration or use. The ability to acquire the relevant permits and coordinate across different owners of CO2 transport and sequestration infrastructure are also critical to consider.</p><p>Companies using or planning to use CCUS at their facilities should adhere to relevant regulatory frameworks; monitor and report the environmental impacts of the technology; engage with local communities; and commit to project agreements, including community benefits agreements. These companies should also demonstrate their commitments towards responsible decarbonization by implementing other decarbonization technologies and practices in addition to CCUS. Along with verifying carbon removal, third party auditors could also be used to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of CCUS projects to provide greater transparency and accountability.</p><h3>What's Next for CCUS?</h3><p>CCUS will likely need to play some role in helping meet net-zero goals. The ultimate level of scale-up required is uncertain and will depend on many factors, including how quickly other decarbonization options are developed and commercialized in different sectors, the level of policy and financial support provided, and how public perceptions shift in the coming years.</p><p>At the same time, it is important to <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-carbon-capture-distraction/\">separate</a> the technological feasibility from the policies, regulations and incentives that drive where and how CCUS is applied. Ensuring that the needed applications of CCUS do not perpetuate fossil fuels, or local harms related to power or industrial facilities, will be critical to making it a viable option to support reaching net zero.</p><p>While there have been <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/on-earth-day-we-finally-have-a-president-who-follows-science/\">mixed</a> <a href=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/05/01/100-days-of-trump-2-0-carbon-management-and-negative-emissions/\">signals</a> about continued U.S. federal support for CCUS, other countries continue to move forward with policy support and project development. <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/03/carbon-capture-storage-essentials-uptake/\">Regional hubs</a> in the <a href=\"https://ccushub.ogci.com/focus_hubs/aramco-jubail-ccs-hub/\">Middle East</a> and <a href=\"https://norlights.com/\">Northern Europe</a> are consolidating CCUS infrastructure within high emitting regions and spurring cross-border collaboration. As CCUS advances, these leaders must ensure that it is not used to avoid or slow down the process of phasing out fossil fuels, which is imperative to meeting our collective climate goals.</p><p><em>Editor's note: This article was originally published in November 2023.

The <a href=\"https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230921-Pathways-to-Commercial-Liftoff-Chemicals-Refining.pdf\">U.S. Department of Energy estimates</a> that, combined with oil refining, chemical production is responsible for about 8% of the U.S.’s gross domestic product. Of that output, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/chemicals/121924-commodities-2025-modest-recovery-in-us-chemical-volumes-expected-in-2025\">28% is exported</a> at an estimated projected value of $175 billion throughout 2025.</p><p>Chemical production’s large role in the U.S. economy and the exports that sustain it make it a vital industry. Yet, it must adapt to growing pressure internationally for goods that are produced with zero or few emissions despite expectations that both U.S. chemical demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expected to grow approximately <a href=\"https://climateprogramportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20230921-Pathways-to-Commercial-Liftoff-Chemicals-Refining.pdf\">35% in a business-as-usual scenario</a>.</p><p>For the U.S. to remain competitive, retain access to important foreign markets and reduce its trade deficit in line with the Trump Administration’s goals, its chemical manufacturers must modernize and reduce emissions. A standardized carbon accounting framework is fundamental to maximizing investments in innovative, low-carbon technologies.</p><h3>Carbon-Based Trade Policy</h3><p>International action to reduce greenhouse gases is increasingly including emissions-intensive industrial products like cement, steel and chemicals. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/clean-industrial-manufacturing-climate-trade-policies\">Carbon tariffs</a> on imports are a tool that can monetize a country’s industrial innovation and carbon advantage while inducing other countries to reduce their emissions. Fundamentally, the various forms of carbon tariffs work by levying fees on imports that exceed a set emissions-intensity threshold, such as tons of CO2 per ton of steel.</p><p>The most prominent such measure is the <a href=\"https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/news/eu-reaches-landmark-provisional-agreement-ets-reform-and-new-policies-meet-2030-target\">EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</a>, which would levy a fee on carbon intensive imports based on the EU’s carbon price. Other countries have carbon policies that could be expanded to include imports. Examples include <a href=\"https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/news/china-expand-national-ets-cement-steel-and-aluminum-2024#:~:text=China%20to%20expand%20national%20ETS%20to%20cement%2C%20steel%20and%20aluminum%20in%202024.&text=The%20Work%20Plan%20for%20the%20inclusion%20of,the%20first%20compliance%20deadline%20scheduled%20for%202025.\">China’s Emissions Trading System</a> and <a href=\"https://en.vneconomy.vn/vietnam-targets-power-steel-cement-for-carbon-market-trial.htm\">Vietnam’s carbon market</a> — which will soon cover domestic cement, steel and aluminum — and <a href=\"https://earth.org/what-countries-have-a-carbon-tax/\">27 additional countries</a> that have carbon prices or taxes.</p><p>If the EU’s pioneering carbon market serves as a model for other countries, incorporating relatively simpler commodities like steel and cement open the door for <a href=\"https://normative.io/insight/eu-cbam-explained/\">chemicals’ inclusion later</a>, given the sector’s emissions. Globally, chemical production emits <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-024-00047-z\">1.3 billion to 2.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)</a>  per year, or up to 2.5% of all emissions; it comprises about <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-huge-climate-problem-of-cement-steel-and-chemicals-visualized\">15% of industrial emissions</a>, after steel and cement. As one of the largest chemical producers in the world, the U.S. share in chemical trade and emissions is substantial, as is its need to modernize.</p><h3>Chemical Sector Emissions in the U.S.</h3><p>A recent estimate suggests that the production life cycle of petrochemicals—chemicals derived from fossil fuels— emit <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/petrochemicals-emissions/\">306 million to 343 million metric tons of CO2e</a>  in the U.S. Multiple pathways have emerged to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/resources-defossilized-chemical-production-united-states\">reduce emissions from petrochemicals</a>. However, reducing emissions from chemical production is expensive and can add an estimated <a href=\"https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Net_Zero_Industry_Tracker_2024_Primary_Chemicals.pdf\">55% “green premium”</a> or additional cost for foundational precursor chemicals. To meet <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/crafting-robust-us-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism\">international pressure</a> for low emission chemicals and maintain its prominence as the global innovation center, the U.S. must work with producers to reduce emissions.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1045\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"836\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"640\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"504\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"302\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chemical Emissions Accounting Feedstocks\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/00-25-insights-chemical-emissions-accounting-feedstocks.png?VersionId=B4bKB_d53aBQRa1n7OiYkbeDgfjgGM03&itok=qVsvTiqs\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>A range of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/next-generation-us-policies-industrial-innovation\">supportive policies</a>, including grants and incentives, were passed during the Biden Administration to derisk and encourage investment in low-emission industrial technologies and processes. A keystone policy is the Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP), which awarded seven projects up to $500 million to manufacture low-emission chemicals. For example, a project is under negotiation for $200 million to <a href=\"https://ir.lanzatech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/technip-energies-and-lanzatech-selected-us-department-energy\">recycle CO2</a> from chemical production to make new chemicals.</p><p>These policies to spur innovative industry — many of which were created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — are also creating tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investments across the country, particularly in areas that have been harmed by deindustrialization. However, their economic gains are being lost or are uncertain due to federal cutting of <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/what-it-means-to-cut-the-office-of-clean-energy-demonstrations/\">vital industrial programs</a>.</p><h3>Satisfying Growing Demand for Low-Emission Chemicals</h3><p>Notwithstanding the demand for low-emission products from countries with current or future carbon tariffs, there is growing voluntary demand from producers to make more sustainable products and from companies to purchase those products. For example, the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) enables and collects corporate commitments to reduce emissions. Over <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard\">half of its 11,000 members</a> are targeting supply chain emissions, all of which nearly guaranteed to contain chemical products.</p><p>However, these companies must understand the emission intensity of chemicals (i.e. GHG emissions per unit of product), including emissions along the value chain.  But due to the fragmented nature of the industry this foundational information is often inaccessible and makes tracing emissions of 70,000 different end-use products notoriously complex.</p><p>To assist businesses and consumers intent on purchasing less carbon-intensive chemical products and design effective policy to reduce emissions, the U.S. needs globally aligned robust frameworks to monitor, report and verify data.  This includes standardized frameworks to measure emissions across the value chain, develop industry average and low-emissions benchmarks for chemical production and report the emissions intensity of primary and end-use chemical products.</p><h3>Scoping out the Problem</h3><p>To reduce their products’ emission intensity, companies must know and eliminate the emissions from the facility making the product (Scope 1), the electricity they purchased (Scope 2) and all purchased goods and services up the supply chain and from use and disposal (Scope 3). And if down-stream suppliers want to sell low-emissions products, they must account for the emissions from the value chain of that product.</p><p>Current U.S. federal law only requires facilities that emit more than 25 kilotons CO2e to report their Scope 1 emissions to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting\">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. The EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding determined that GHGs like CO2 fall under the agency’s regulatory purview, and challenges to this have been <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/overview-epa-endangerment-finding\">rejected by the Supreme Court</a> several times. However, the Trump administration has ordered the EPA to reconsider this rule, which would <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-epa-greenhouse-gas-reporting-climate-crisis\">effectively eliminate</a> the requirement for nearly all facilities to collect and report this data. Additionally, certain public companies were required to disclose their total Scope 2 emissions in their Security and Exchange Commission filings until the Trump administration <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5138697-sec-rejects-climate-disclosure-rule/\">struck the rule</a>. There are no existing or previous requirements for companies to measure and disclose Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>This does not mean Scope 2 and Scope 3 data or efforts to collect it do not exist. Accounting frameworks designed by the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope3_Calculation_Guidance_0.pdf\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a> (GHGP) and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/71206.html\">International Standards Organization</a> (ISO) guide multi-sector efforts like the <a href=\"https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/guidance_docs/pdfs/000/003/504/original/CDP-technical-note-scope-3-relevance-by-sector.pdf\">Carbon Disclosure Project</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globalreporting.org\">Global Reporting Initiative</a>, through which companies can voluntarily reduce their direct (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scopes 2 and 3).</p><p>GHGP and ISO also underly sector-specific emission measurement frameworks and benchmarking. <a href=\"https://www.tfs-initiative.com/app/uploads/2024/03/TfS_PCF_guidelines_2024_EN_pages-low.pdf\">Together For Sustainability</a>, a coalition of chemical companies, published carbon intensity accounting recommendations that align with the GHGP and ISO rules. Similarly, the Science Based Targets Initiative has developed draft guidance for chemical companies to set <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/SBTi-Chemicals-Sector-Guidance-Consultation-Draft.pdf\">emission reduction targets</a>.</p><p>Additionally, there are <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/life-cycle-databases\">databases for product life cycle assessments</a> (LCA) and also the <a href=\"https://www.lcacommons.gov/\">Federal LCA Commons</a>, which is a repository of LCA methodologies that includes chemicals and petrochemicals. But these data are often secondary, used when data directly provided by an emitter are unavailable and produced using unharmonized standards and methodologies.</p><h3>Emissions Accounting and Complex Value Chains</h3><p>Measuring and accounting for greenhouse gas emissions can be done at the company-, facility- and, ideally, the product-level. Currently, the Clean Air Act requires high emitting facilities to collect and report their emissions to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Companies aggregate facility-level (Scope 1) and Scopes 2 and 3 emissions, where possible, to estimate their corporate emissions.</p><p>Companies or third parties use life cycle assessments to estimate a product’s carbon intensity by measuring emissions along its manufacturing process. For product-level data in the industrial sector this is typically “<a href=\"https://browningday.com/news/lca-stages-matter-when-tracking-embodied-carbon/\">cradle-to-gate”</a> emissions (A1 to A3 of a life cycle), which includes extracting and processing raw materials, transportation of the feedstock and fuels, and processing of the feedstock including direct or indirect emissions (from purchased electricity, for instance). </p><p>For chemical products, carrying out LCAs often requires making difficult determinations about how to account for and attribute emissions among numerous products created through multiple manufacturing processes. In addition, life cycle assessments require establishing boundaries to determine a product’s emissions.</p><p>An even more complete picture than cradle-to-gate is cradle-to-grave (feedstock to disposal) or cradle-to-cradle (feedstock to recycling) emissions accounting approaches, which include many other emissions and accounting variables typically out of the producer’s control.</p><p>Including the disposal or recycling stages requires more considerations, some of which are <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/renee-sharp/plastics-industrys-latest-deception-mass-balance\">heavily debated</a>. Tracing the carbon intensity of a single product grows in difficulty with the number of processing stages, coproducts and disaggregation in the supply chain; this is further obfuscated by a lack of transparency and inconsistency in accounting methods.</p><p>Each production stage typically occurs in separate, specialized facilities that can produce a diverse number of goods depending on demand fluctuations. Ideally, each facility would use standardized measurement systems and securely transmit primary data across the supply chain. Realistically, uncertainty likely dominates as each facility could use different standards to measure Scope 1 (e.g. direct metering, mass balance, stoichiometry) and Scope 2 emissions and allocate co-products (mass, economic or energy balances).</p><p>If facilities do not publicize product-level emissions or disclose their production technologies, secondary data such as public LCAs or aggregated data can be used. However, this introduces uncertainty. Secondary data resources may vary and there is no strong incentive to use systems with greater granularity, such as <a href=\"https://climatetrace.org\">ClimateTRACE</a> and other initiatives. Emissions from feedstocks are an additional complicating factor, as fugitive methane emissions are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25017-4\">frequently underestimated</a> or ignored. Additionally, lower-carbon alternative feedstocks like biomass and captured CO2 have complex emissions profiles that can range from negative to positive emissions depending on many factors.   </p><p>Shorter, simpler supply chains reduce the number of Scope 3 variables. For example, one study examining <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-024-00047-z#ref-CR18\">carbon accounting uncertainty</a> for primary chemicals assessed 19 different ammonia production pathways with four feedstocks. In contrast, they assessed 63 pathways for ethylene with 14 feedstocks and a larger range of carbon intensities. Ammonia requires fewer processing facilities than ethylene, reducing the number of stages where carbon intensity data must be calculated. And most ammonia goes toward a single use.</p><p>As a result, setting emission standards for ammonia is more straightforward than most primary chemicals. This shorter, more integrated supply chain is conducive to policy that relies on life cycle assessments and emission benchmarks. For example, Japan has enacted a <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/energy-transition/061424-japan-tightens-low-carbon-ammonia-standards-to-align-with-europe-us#:~:text=Under%20the%20revised%20standards%2C%20the,fossil%20fuel-based%20gray%20ammonia.\">low-carbon ammonia standard</a> and the European Union includes ammonia as the first primary chemical included in its <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/CBAM%20Guidance_EU%20231121%20for%20web_0.pdf\">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</a>.</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Case Study: Ammonia and Ethylene</strong></p><p><em><strong>Ammonia</strong></em></p><p>Synthetic ammonia fertilizer is the foundation for the modern agricultural system.

Ethylene is produced in the same reactor as other primary chemicals, the ratios of which depend on the facility design and daily market fluctuations. The branching paths continue through polymerization and final plastic conversion.  </p></div><h3>Existing and Proposed Standards Frameworks</h3><p>Ethylene and other primary chemicals that face similar accounting difficulties lack harmonized standards, making it difficult to set decarbonization policies. However, some organizations have worked to design harmonized approaches that could be incorporated into policy.</p><p>The “general standards” are foundational frameworks that sector-specific organizations use to develop standards for their industries. The chemical sector-specific standards propose methods to estimate, track and communicate product carbon intensity and emission reductions. Most, if not all sector-specific standards, will indicate that their proposals comply with general frameworks set by, for example, ISO and GHG Protocol.</p><p>The Industrial Transition Accelerator developed a similar summary of standards for <a href=\"https://3stepsolutions.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/assets/custom/010937/PDFs/ITA-Mapping_the_Landscape_of_Low-Emissions_Product_Standards(2024).pdf?CID=f6689e4b-614f-48ba-a43f-ac58fe5e2452\">ammonia and methanol</a> that have broad uptake in policies across multiple countries and regions. </p><table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><caption><strong>Emissions Accounting Frameworks </strong></caption><thead><tr><th>Guidance</th><th>Description</th><th>Key Guidance Contribution for Chemicals</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>General Standards Frameworks (Economywide)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ISO <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/66453.html\">14064</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/71206.html\">14067</a></td><td>Overarching principles frameworks that guide how companies, projects and third parties manage emissions and data.</td><td>ISO standards series sets the overarching frameworks for accounting and verifying GHG emissions and product carbon intensity.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/Intro_GHGP_Tech.pdf\">GHG Protocol</a></td><td>Provides precise measurement and calculation methodologies that comply with ISO principles.</td><td>Scope measurement guidance is applicable to the chemical sector.

This is partially due to the relative simplicity of their supply chains which produce far fewer different products for which emissions must be accounted than the chemical sector. This, in combination with the public sector’s outsized share of demand for cement and steel, facilitates development of emissions reporting frameworks alongside <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/green-procurement-initiatives\">green procurement programs</a>.</p><p>There’s an opportunity for policymakers and companies to work together to codify proposed or similarly interoperable and harmonized standards for the chemical sector. Although the Trump administration abolished the Buy Clean program, a pivotal purchasing program to drive clean cement and steel production, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/states-are-moving-forward-with-buy-clean-policies-despite-trump-reversal\">some states</a> have passed their own Buy Clean programs and U.S. producers will still face international pressure to reduce emissions for exports.</p><h4>Maintain and Amend Reporting Requirements</h4><p>It would disadvantage U.S. competitiveness for the Trump administration to follow through on its efforts to eliminate or hamper emissions reporting. This data is the bedrock for future action and should be collected for U.S. chemical companies to innovate ahead of competitors.</p><p>Assuming the databases are maintained, some of the information that polluting facilities report to the EPA — emission volumes, process units and fuel use — are publicly available, while other data — feedstock types and volumes and amount of product — are classified as Confidential Business Information (CBI). While CBI rules protect producers by keeping vital information away from competitors, these rules also complicate attempts by third partis to calculate Scope 3 emissions or estimate product carbon intensity.</p><p>GHGRP’s public interface could add reasonable measures of transparency that enable third parties to estimate or verify production emissions while also protecting producers’ confidentiality. One simple way to do this would be to list the main products manufactured in a chemical facility.</p><p>Currently, facilities are not required to list their products, but some can be inferred. For example, chemical plants may list an ethane cracker or ethylene processing unit among its emission sources. This reveals that the plant produces ethylene, but these typically produce other chemicals as well that should also be listed — without accompanying production volumes — to improve clarity within the chemical supply chain.</p><h4>Codify National Emissions Averages for Primary and Key Intermediary Chemicals and Plastics</h4><p>Congress recently <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/4-us-congress-bills-related-carbon-border-adjustments-2023\">introduced several bills</a>, some with bipartisan support, that would similarly address industry’s exposure to climate-based trade measures. Fundamental to these bills is the need to compare the carbon intensity of industrial commodities produced in the U.S. to that of other countries. <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1863/text\">The PROVE IT Act,</a> most explicitly, would require the U.S. to study and publish average emission intensities for key commodities, including petrochemicals and plastics.</p><p>While averages are subject to uncertainty and could differ substantially by facility, they could provide a workable benchmark for policy that protects domestic producers and reduces emissions. U.S. chemicals have been estimated to hold a <a href=\"https://clcouncil.org/reports/chemicals_advantage.pdf\">carbon advantage</a> over many of its competitors. These national average emission intensities for primary products would serve as placeholder values to help downstream producers in estimating their products’ emissions intensities in the absence of specific product data. To reduce errors from remaining uncertainty, the benchmark could be <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5669037/v1\">set slightly above</a> the estimated average.</p><p>Over time, policy could work to incorporate more specificity in their design, ideally with frameworks that align with international systems. Part of that work includes increasing transparency in how existing emissions are currently reported at facilities.</p><h4>Establish a Framework for Assessing and Communicating Chemical Product Carbon Intensity for Demand-Side Policy</h4><p>National averages and improving GHGRP’s reporting transparency are important first steps to developing and improving carbon intensity’s data accuracy. These should be foundational to enshrining standards for carbon accounting, tracking and reporting through <a href=\"https://www.environdec.com/pcr/the-pcr\">product category rules</a> (PCRs) and environmental product declarations (EPDs) for chemical products.</p><p>EPDs are akin to nutrition labels for commodities and materials, disclosing a product’s global warming potential and other environmental impacts. PCRs are the rules that producers must follow when creating an EPD, outlining methodologies, definitions and scopes for covered products. In concert, EPDs and PCRs harmonize and standardize how producers measure and disclose their emissions, which unlocks policy opportunities (e.g. public procurement, advance market commitments) that benefit compliant and high-performing manufacturers.  </p><p>The Inflation Reduction Act authorized $250 million for the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/key-information-epas-environmental-product-declaration-epd-assistance-program\">EPA’s EPD Assistance Program</a>, which sought to develop EPDs and PCRs for construction materials and to feed into the now defunct federal Buy Clean Program. A similar program could develop a <a href=\"https://www.tfs-initiative.com/news/tfs-becomes-associated-partner-in-the-chem-x-project-2\">Digital Product Passports</a> for chemical products, whereby an agency works with industry or a coalition like <a href=\"https://www.tfs-initiative.com/\">Together for Sustainability (TfS)</a> to adopt proposed rules on scope, methodologies and metrics. Oregon’s rule on <a href=\"https://www.packagingdive.com/news/life-cycle-assessments-epr-oregon-ecomodulation-plastic/735584/\">Extended Producer Responsibility</a> uses cradle-to-gate LCAs on packaging and could serve as a model.</p><p>An ambitious version of this could be geared toward specific products like the most highly-produced plastics. But given the heterogeneity of final products and their hundreds of minute additives, initial efforts could be more effective by defining the scope around primary chemical production — putting a carbon label on chemicals like ammonia, ethylene or benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) based on consistent emissions accounting principles. This reduces the number of upstream factors to incorporate while the system matures, emphasizes the production stage where the highest percentage of emissions are concentrated and involves some of the largest companies that are more likely to be able to afford, finance or incorporate emission reduction technologies in the near-term.</p><p>Downstream purchasers can cite the percentage of reduced emissions that came from their less carbon-intensive primary chemicals. Over time, more downstream facilities and products can be included in the EPD’s scope, such tools like <a href=\"https://miq.org/miq-highwood-index/\">the MiQ-Highwood index</a> for methane emissions.</p><h3>How the U.S. Can Become Global Data Champions</h3><p>U.S. dominance in innovative manufacturing relies as deeply on data as it does on the people putting steel in the ground to build new, advanced facilities. Manufacturers developing cutting-edge technology to compete with new international carbon tariffs and satisfy demand for cleaner, reliable materials must be able to agree on how to measure the carbon in their supply chains. By working with industry, policymakers can champion data infrastructure, leading the charge to enact frameworks that will guide manufacturing and trade and avoid being left behind by foreign competitors.</p>",
