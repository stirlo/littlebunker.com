      "description": "<p>In the southern Brazilian Amazon, seed collectors carefully search the forest floor. They move among the trees, mindful not to harm surrounding plants as they bend and crouch to gather native seeds from the soil and fallen fruit.</p><p>They are part of the <a href=\"https://www.sementesdoxingu.org.br/\">Xingu Seeds Network (ARSX)</a>, an association in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso that brings together about 700 Amazonian seed collectors. Launched in 2007 by the Instituto Socioambiental (Socio-Environmental Institute, or ISA) and Indigenous leaders, the network helps locals sell seeds to organizations and landowners, who use them in forest restoration projects.</p><p>So far, nearly 1,000 families from more than 100 Indigenous villages and local communities have taken part in the initiative. They have gathered seeds from over 220 species, generated over 8.5 million reais ($1.7 million) in income and contributed to the restoration of 27 million trees on 11,000 hectares of previously degraded land. More than 390 metric tons of native seeds have been sold so far, setting an unprecedented record in the Amazon.</p><p>It is a prime example of how an “Indigenous bioeconomy” — developed and sustained by Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities in the Amazon — can provide economic opportunities while also preserving biological, cultural and social diversity.</p><p>“[ARSX has] shown Brazil and the world that it is possible to give value to a standing forest,” said Rodrigo Junqueira, executive secretary of ISA. “[It] has demonstrated that it is possible to price seeds and develop an economy around them without excluding people or stakeholders from the process.”</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Defining Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities</strong></p><p><strong>Indigenous peoples</strong> are ethnic groups with a history of settlement in the Americas dating back roughly 10,000 to 15,000 years. They have their own languages, political and governance systems, justice structures and distinct approaches to territorial management and stewardship.</p><p>As recognized by <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/mma/pt-br/assuntos/povos-e-comunidades-tradicionais/povos-e-comunidades-tradicionais-EN\">Brazilian legislation</a>, <strong>traditional peoples</strong> identify as culturally distinct groups. They maintain ways of life closely tied to nature and their own social organization, and they use knowledge, innovations and practices passed down through generations. Among them are <strong>quilombolas</strong>, traditional Afro-Brazilian communities formed by rural Black communities with their own historical trajectories, specific territorial relations and Black ancestry linked to the period of slavery; and <strong>ribeirinhos</strong>, traditional riverine communities, especially in the Amazon, whose ways of life are closely connected to the river and the surrounding forest.   </p></div><h3>An Indigenous Bioeconomy for the Amazon</h3><p>As deforestation and degradation in the Amazon draw increasing global attention, interest is growing in building an Indigenous-led bioeconomy. About <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/vision_amazon/living_amazon_initiative222/protected_areas_and_indigenous_territories/\">2.7 million Indigenous Peoples</a> live in the Amazon, and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-could-bioeconomy-amazon-look\">research shows</a> that they are effective land stewards, with forest loss rates <a href=\"https://alerta.mapbiomas.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/RAD2024_28_10.pdf\">30 times lower</a> than in comparable forest areas managed by others.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/bioeconomy-amazon-concepts-limits-and-trends-proper-definition-tropical-forest-biome\">bioeconomy is a concept</a> with competing and often contested definitions that reflect different economic and political priorities. Within this context, the Indigenous bioeconomy offers a distinct model for the Amazon — one rooted in Indigenous governance and ancestral knowledge that generates income while keeping the forest standing. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-center \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1200\" />\n              <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1200\" />\n              <source height=\"804\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"633\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"379\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A Tikuna woman chops Brazil nuts at the local Tikuna market in Tabatinga, Brazil\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/a-tikuna-woman-chops-brazil-nuts-at-the-local-tikuna-market-in-tabatinga-brazil.png?VersionId=aPt8i9J8JH3ppiyTfE56IT1AV_L_H_oI&itok=qmOX5b9R\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>An Indigenous Tikuna woman chops local Brazil nuts at the local Tikuna market in Tabatinga in the Brazilian Amazon. Photo by All Media Vagalume/WRI Brasil</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Rather than treating nature as a commodity, it recognizes the interdependence of land, people, animals, plants and ecosystems. It prioritizes diverse, forest-based production that sustains livelihoods and protects biodiversity. Economic activities are aligned with the forest’s natural rhythms — not the other way around — and territorial governance is strengthened to maintain the ecological integrity of Indigenous lands. </p><p>“A true bioeconomy presupposes diversity, recognition and the appreciation of the peoples who hold and sustain it,” said Junqueira, noting that Indigenous approaches avoid replicating extractive models that concentrate income and exclude forest communities. </p><p>Data from WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/new-economy-brazil-amazon\">New Economy for the Amazon</a> report shows that pursuing a deforestation-free, low-carbon pathway could create an additional 312,000 jobs in the region by 2050 and boost the Brazilian Amazon’s annual GDP from that year onward by at least 40 billion reais ($8.2 billion). It could also contribute an estimated 226 billion reais ($50 billion) to Brazil’s overall GDP. Beyond these quantifiable benefits, investing in the Indigenous bioeconomy can offer lasting value, from ecosystem services across multiple traditional service sectors to food security for Indigenous and traditional peoples. It can also help address systemic exclusion and strengthen Indigenous leadership and authority over territorial governance.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-center full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Handicrafts at the local Tikuna market in Tapatinga, Brazil\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-01/handicrafts-at-the-local-tikuna-market-in-tapatinga-brazil.jpg?VersionId=0YAjWlT05QQtLOCW5DUgPP088ZCQA6bl&h=2e3eca71&itok=dc_P1cSq\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Handicrafts are another example of products that stimulate the Indigenous bioeconomy.

These elements not only set it apart from conventional forest-based industries, but they are also key to ensuring that a bioeconomy delivers benefits for people, nature and the climate. Grounded in climate justice, they address historical and structural inequities by securing Indigenous and traditional peoples’ decision-making power, land tenure and fair participation in sustainable economic activity. </p><h4>Reciprocity. Production that Values Ecosystems</h4><p>Clearing land for crops, cattle, logging or mining has long dominated the Amazon’s economy. This model prioritizes production, often degrading forests and land while excluding the people who depend on them. In contrast, reciprocity is a key element of the Indigenous bioeconomy, where production, exchange and trade sustain both people and the forest, including animals, plants, rivers and other parts of the ecosystem. Collective benefit takes precedence over individual profit, with income generated from activities that maintain biodiversity and tree cover.</p><p>In the Xingu River Basin in the southern Amazon, for example, <a href=\"https://concertacaoamazonia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Volume-3_Bioeconomia-indigena-1.pdf\">the Ikpeng gatherers</a> never collect all the seeds they find along the trails, recognizing that some must be left to allow trees to grow and produce seeds for future generations.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://concertacaoamazonia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Volume-3_Bioeconomia-indigena-1.pdf\">the Baniwa communities</a> make traditional handicrafts, from ceramics to woven baskets, using sustainably gathered materials and techniques that preserve the forest by following seasonal cycles and material availability, while also supporting their livelihoods. This kind of ancestral knowledge about native species and their seasons helps keep harvesting in the Amazon sustainable.</p><h4>Redistribution. Benefits that Circulate Rather Than Concentrate</h4><p>Wealth generated from natural resources in the Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01387-7\">typically left the region, while environmental and social harm remains</a>. For example, large-scale monoculture soy production has caused the disappearance of plant species important as medicines and food staples for Indigenous people.</p><p>In the Indigenous bioeconomy, redistribution means resources and benefits are shared fairly, ensuring economic gains are equally circulated rather than concentrated. It helps promote local economic stability, social cohesion and solidarity. It also strengthens collective well-being, not only of people but also of “more-than-humans” — a term reflecting the Indigenous view that people are not at the top of a hierarchy but are part of a deep interconnection with other beings, tied to spiritual beliefs about nature, ancestors and sacred places.</p><p>Redistribution can take shape through initiatives like <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2024/02/in-brazils-soy-belt-community-seed-banks-offer-hope-for-the-amazon/\">community seed banks</a>, which promote sharing resources rather than concentrating them. By exchanging seeds with other communities, these banks help restore species that have disappeared in some territories, using seeds from areas where they still thrive.</p>\n\n      \n\n    \n    \n<div class=\"embedded-entity embed--block-type--in-this-series has-border-background-color\">\n      <h3 class=\"embed-block__title\">Related</h3>\n  \n  \n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-featured-items field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/forests\" hreflang=\"en\">Forests</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-could-bioeconomy-amazon-look\" hreflang=\"en\">What Could a “Bioeconomy” in the Amazon Look Like?</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            November 14, 2022\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Aerial view of Amazon River\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2022-11/shutterstock_335594075.jpg?VersionId=YgrYWc9hyfamaFainDFBQRmp0IR9.W9Z&h=fa04d214&itok=zkZT5MX6\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/equitable-development\" hreflang=\"en\">Equity & Governance</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-forest-pledges-must-center-forest-communities\" hreflang=\"en\">For New Global Forest Pledges to Succeed, They Must Center Forest Communities</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            November 7, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Two men paddling a boat to collect acai berries in the Amazon Rainforest.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2025-10/hero.jpg?VersionId=p0_HVQTmmiqg2cvczygn3wwU6SgYdOo0&h=f2fcf546&itok=-3WavJWe\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n<h4>Recognition. Centering Indigenous Governance and Land Rights</h4><p>The Indigenous bioeconomy is inseparable from the forest ecosystem and Indigenous expertise. It places ancestral knowledge at the center of sustainable production while working together with modern science to help communities manage natural resources and develop new products and services.</p><p>Central to this approach is recognition: Indigenous and traditional peoples must have secure land rights, the authority to decide how resources, knowledge, intellectual property and data are managed, as well as how value is created and shared, based on their free, prior and informed consent. Without recognition, communities remain vulnerable to the appropriation of their practices and innovations as economic activities unfold in their territories.</p><p>“Without territory, there is no bioeconomy,” said Junqueira. This is because without land recognition and governance authority, Indigenous populations face logging, land grabbing and restrictions that prevent them from managing the forest they protect. Community-led practices, such as selective harvesting, cannot shape markets or production systems without secure rights and decision-making power.</p><p>The Jiquitaia chili pepper, <a href=\"https://www.landrightsnow.org/the-women-behind-baniwa-jiquitaia-pepper/\">harvested and sold by Baniwa Indigenous women</a> in Alto Rio Negro in the northeastern Amazon, shows what recognition looks like in practice. Produced using traditional knowledge and harvesting methods developed over generations, the chili is commercialized according to the Baniwa women themselves, ensuring Indigenous authority over how the product is managed, valued and brought to market. It is a key example of connecting traditional stewardship with market opportunities while preserving the forest and reinforcing Indigenous control over land, knowledge and value creation.</p><h4>Respect. Production that Honors Culture, Knowledge and Heritage</h4><p>Respect for Indigenous peoples, their practices, sacred land and spiritual beliefs is essential, as the Indigenous bioeconomy requires accepting economic models and definitions beyond a basic capitalist or market system. In this approach, products and services are not the end, but a means of safeguarding ways of life, systems of knowledge and heritage.</p><p>Respect is expressed clearly in Indigenous food systems, which connect forest conservation, livelihoods and collective well-being. Climate change, deforestation and market pressures are disrupting these systems, contributing to the loss of Indigenous staples, shifts toward ultra-processed foods and increased malnutrition and food scarcity. By supporting forest-based livelihoods, agroforestry, fisheries and local value chains rooted in ancestral knowledge, the Indigenous bioeconomy helps restore access to nutritious, culturally appropriate foods while generating income without forest loss. Sustainable harvesting practices also protect ancient monumental constructions (geoglifos) and sacred natural sites (kymyrury), unlike large-scale clearing of land for farming and ranching.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-center full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Amazon market food in Tabatinga, featuring everyday staples of the local diet, including cassava flour, tapioca, bananas and garlic.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-01/amazon-market-food-in-tabatinga-featuring-everyday-staples-of-the-local-diet-including-cassava-flour-tapioca-bananas-and-garlic.jpg?VersionId=vZWTWcNpMdddgSGiagTly1c4f7eHYD2k&h=2e3eca71&itok=13OzFRNW\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Amazon market food in Tabatinga, featuring everyday staples of the local diet, including cassava flour, tapioca, bananas and garlic.

The process is valued because it integrates ancestral knowledge, community practices, technologies and diverse ways of producing and sharing resources. Maintaining the close connection between the way of doing things and its consequences for the social division of labor is what makes production meaningful.    </p><h4>A Path Forward for the Indigenous Bioeconomy </h4><p>In the Amazon, where <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/strategies-amazon-rainforest-climate-action-brazil\">social inequalities and environmental pressures create complex challenges</a> for sustainable development, the Indigenous bioeconomy offers a viable way forward.</p><p>Rooted in reciprocity, redistribution, recognition and respect, it is an approach that links economic opportunity with land stewardship and a commitment to collective well-being.

      "pubDate": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:00:00 EST",
      "description": "<p>Roughly two-thirds of the ocean lies outside any single country's jurisdiction. These vast waters, known as the \"high seas,\" hold huge importance to the health of the planet, housing rich biodiversity and natural resources that are vital for both the climate and economies. Yet a comprehensive framework to govern and safeguard the high seas has been missing — until now.</p><p>After nearly 20 years of negotiations, governments, ocean advocates and others finally secured a global treaty to protect and sustainably use the ocean areas that lie beyond countries' jurisdictions. The \"High Seas Treaty\" — formally known as the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en\">BBNJ agreement</a>) — was ratified in September 2025 and officially enters into force on Jan. 17, 2026. From this date, ratifying countries are legally bound by the agreement to support conservation and sustainable management of high‐seas biodiversity.</p><p>While this marks a major milestone, several key aspects of the treaty still need to be ironed out. Detailed compliance and implementation procedures are expected to be finalized at the treaty's first summit — the \"Conference of Parties,\" or \"BBNJ COP\" — within the next year. These discussions will cover critical issues, like the designation of high seas marine protected areas; how to assess the environmental impacts of ocean activities that happen beyond national jurisdictions; and how to fairly share benefits from marine genetic resources.</p><p>In the lead-up to this landmark summit and the treaty's full rollout, here's what to know.</p><h3>Why the High Seas Treaty Matters</h3><p>The ambition of the High Seas Treaty has always been immense. It seeks to facilitate international coordination on activities within Earth's largest public common, covering around half the planet's surface.</p><p>The high seas host a diverse array of marine life, from microscopic plankton to colossal blue whales. Alongside supporting global fisheries and food security, they are home to valuable natural resources that countries and companies are ever-more eager to explore and exploit. For example, marine genetic materials are increasingly sought after to support pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and other innovations.</p><p>Without a binding global treaty, the high seas have been governed patchwork style through regional fisheries agreements, shipping conventions, and scattered marine protected areas which cover <a href=\"https://mpatlas.org/countries/HS/\">less than 1%</a> of the high seas. This leaves critical gaps in protecting marine biodiversity and ensuring that developing countries also benefit from discoveries made in international waters.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About Sustainable Ocean Plans</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\"><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/sustainable-ocean-plans\">Sustainable Ocean Plans</a> are comprehensive \"umbrella frameworks\" that unify all of a country's ocean-related policies, plans and mechanisms and help align them with international frameworks and best practices. All 19 member countries of the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/high-level-panel-sustainable-ocean-economy\">Ocean Panel</a> have agreed to producing an SOP. The <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance</a> is a further collection of coastal and ocean nations that have agreed to implement SOPs, including the Republic of Korea and Panama.</p></div><p>The High Seas Treaty will fill regulatory gaps, complement national efforts and enable coordinated conservation measures on the high seas, all of which will be critical for achieving international <a href=\"https://globalgoals.org/goals/14-life-below-water/\">climate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/gbf\">biodiversity</a> goals. It will also help guide regional cooperation and link seamlessly to countries' <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/sustainable-ocean-plans/\">sustainable ocean plans</a>, through which 21 nations have pledged to sustainably manage 100% of the ocean areas under their jurisdiction.</p><p>Together, these measures will come together to create a more cohesive system of ocean stewardship spanning from coastlines to open ocean.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two divers swim near colorful coral reefs.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/coral-reef-high-seas_0.jpg?VersionId=dz33TQ2qAdQictZslfe_Ehf3w7B5jxG9&h=62bc044e&itok=eQ9bfSJ_\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The ocean is full of rich natural resources, like genetic material from coral, that countries and companies are looking to use for everything from pharmaceuticals to new technologies.

MPAs are typically clearly defined geographical spaces that are recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.</p><p>Some MPAs <a href=\"https://www.ospar.org/work-areas/bdc/marine-protected-areas/mpas-in-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction\">already exist</a> on the high seas. For example, six MPAs were established in the Northeast Atlantic in 2010 with a total area of 286,200 square kilometers (110,502 square miles). The <a href=\"https://www.asoc.org/campaign/ross-sea-mpa/\">Ross Sea MPA</a> was established in 2016 to protect a total area of 1.5 million square kilometers (600,000 square miles) in the Southern Ocean.</p><p>The treaty will also establish a pathway for proposing new zones for protection via a consultation process, supported by scientific evidence.</p><h4>2) Marine genetic resources</h4><p>The treaty will establish rules for sharing financial and non-financial benefits from the commercial application of genetic material sourced from high-seas marine organisms, such as bacteria, corals or deep-sea sponges. This material can be used in medicine, cosmetics, food and biotechnology; innovations with <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/ocean-human-health/\">huge potential benefits</a> for human health and wellbeing.</p><h4>3) Capacity building and transfer of marine technology</h4><p>The High Seas Treaty also supports technology and knowledge sharing — particularly to low-income countries that need these resources to advance conservation and sustainable ocean management and ensure they can participate fully in high-seas governance.</p><h4>4) Environmental impact assessments</h4><p>Some countries and companies are proposing activities such as <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/marine-carbon-dioxide-removal/\">marine carbon dioxide removal approaches</a> in areas beyond national borders. The treaty will create a standard process for these actors to conduct assessments that can be shared transparently and follow international standards.</p><h3>What's Not Included in the Agreement?</h3><p>The High Seas Treaty is designed to work within the parameters of existing legal instruments, frameworks and bodies, such as Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and existing fisheries agreements. For example, RFMOs will maintain responsibility for setting quotas and fishing rules under their jurisdiction.</p><p>While the High Seas Treaty will not directly regulate fisheries management, it <em>will </em>shape how fisheries operate on the high seas. This means influencing the environmental standards that fisheries must meet and encouraging a more joined‐up, ecosystem‐based approach to managing ocean resources. This will require closer coordination between fisheries bodies and new High Seas Treaty institutions, along with more data sharing and scientific input.</p><h3>Which Countries Have Ratified the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>As of Jan. 15, the High Seas Treaty has been ratified by 83 parties, who are now legally bound to it. These are also the only countries that will have a say at the treaty summit (BBJN COP) later this year. Countries that have signed but not yet ratified the treaty are not currently legally required to fulfil its requirements. However, they <em>are </em>committed to refraining from activities that contradict the treaty's objectives.</p><p>Countries that were among the first to ratify the treaty included island states such as Palau, Cuba and the Maldives; European Union members including France, Portugal and Spain; and other nations, such as Chile, Norway and South Korea.

Photo by the European Commission.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>What's Next for the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>The High Seas Treaty coming into force is only the first step toward its implementation. For the treaty to be effective, parties need to agree on a strong underlying framework and governance structures that will support its rollout.</p><p>Efforts are already underway. The BBNJ Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) is working to shape treaty operations and prepare for the first BBNJ COP (the date of which has yet to be set). Two preparatory meetings were held in April and August 2025 at the UN Headquarters in New York. The final meeting will be held in the same place from March 23-April 2, 2026.</p><p>These meetings give governments and negotiators an opportunity to develop recommendations that will shape critical elements of the treaty. This includes:</p><ul><li>Forming governing structures.</li><li>Outlining the roles and responsibilities of institutions, such as those that provide data and scientific and technical advice.</li><li>Creating tools and mechanisms to ensure equitable implementation of the treaty.</li><li>Establishing systems to ensure funding and technical knowledge is distributed so all member states can fully participate.</li></ul><p>So far, discussions at these meetings have focused on the operational logistics of the treaty's key bodies. This includes the Scientific and Technical Body, which will advise on science, environmental impact assessments and marine protected areas, and the Clearing House Mechanism, which will serve as a hub for sharing data. Discussions have also centred around financial rules and mechanisms to ensure active participation from all willing governments, such that all goals outlined in the treaty can be reached.</p><p>The last preparatory meeting will aim to see key recommendations finalized, with the intention of bringing these forward and hopefully getting them adopted at the first BBNJ COP. For meaningful implementation of the treaty to begin, is critical that this last meeting is constructive and reaches consensus. Only with the right governing and financial mechanisms in place can the High Seas Treaty go from a landmark agreement to a fully functioning international treaty that protects the global ocean.</p><p>Management of the ocean needs to be as interconnected as the ocean itself. By connecting national actions with a robust global treaty, the world can ensure a resilient, equitable and thriving ocean for generations to come. This treaty is a milestone in the international drive to protect and sustainably use the ocean as a shared resource. Now, nations must turn this into effective action with a robust management and governance framework.</p><p><em>Editor's Note: This article was originally published on June 5, 2025 and updated on Jan. 15, 2026, to reflect the High Seas Treaty coming into force.</em></p>",

Two things were abundantly clear: For one, there’s no such thing as climate-friendly beef, despite labels claiming otherwise. Secondly, some producers are making progress on animal welfare and certain environmental metrics. But while there are technical ways to reduce beef’s emissions, market constraints and the lack of credible, verifiable labels mean that sourcing genuinely lower-emissions beef remains out of reach for most buyers in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>In short? <strong>The only way to guarantee you’re lowering the climate impact of your beef is to buy less of it.</strong></p><p>Here, we answer common questions about beef’s environmental impacts and what food purchasers <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/beef-purchasing-food-service-considerations-companies-balancing-climate-and-other-priorities\">can realistically do</a> — now and in the future — to reduce their climate footprint.</p><h3>Why does beef have such a high environmental footprint compared to other meats?</h3><p>For one, beef cattle take longer to mature (about 1.5-2 years) than other animals like pigs (5-6 months) and poultry (1.5-2 months). They also produce fewer offspring. As a result, they require significantly more feed — and land to grow it. More land per unit of meat means <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered\">greater resource use and higher environmental impacts</a> per gram of protein or kilogram of meat.</p><p>When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions specifically, the climate impact of beef comes from four main sources.</p><p>First are <strong>agricultural production emissions</strong> from actions like applying fertilizers, storing manure and using tractor fuels. This also includes emissions from the production of feed, fertilizers, pesticides and other materials used on the farm.</p><p>Ruminant animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats also have a unique digestive process that generates methane through <strong>enteric fermentation</strong>, primarily released through belching. This adds to their relatively high agricultural production emissions.</p><p>Then there are the emissions produced through beef processing, transportation and other post-farm activities. These are added to the production emissions to arrive at the total <strong>agricultural supply chain emissions</strong>.</p><p>Lastly, natural ecosystems like forests are often converted into pastures to raise cattle and farms to grow animal feed. The loss of these ecosystems’ carbon-storage potential is known as a <strong>carbon opportunity cost</strong>. The importance of accounting for the carbon opportunity cost of agricultural land use is increasingly recognized. When doing so, it typically accounts for the largest portion of beef’s overall climate impact.</p><p>The combination of agricultural supply chain emissions and carbon opportunity cost make up the <strong>total carbon costs</strong> of beef production.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1610\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"1352\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1036\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"816\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"488\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Total carbon costs of U.S. beef production.\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/total-carbon-costs-of-us-beef-production_0.png?VersionId=uX7rFUfQPd5CeK8pF4kvBtWFE4DE_Hzq&itok=NnT64Thl\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Are certain types of cattle farming better for the climate than others?</h3><p>Both location and farming methods can reduce the climate impacts of beef production, but they offer very limited opportunities at this time.</p><p>We’ll start with location.</p><p>Ruminant animals like cattle can graze on land that is too arid, rocky or hilly for crops or forests to grow, such as native grasslands. In these cases, well-managed grazing can offer significant benefits — such as providing livelihoods for millions of pastoralists and preserving <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/grassland-benefits\">native grasslands</a>, which are important for carbon storage, water provision and more.</p><p>The problem is that only <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912416300013\">37% of land</a> used globally to graze or feed cattle and buffalo is unsuitable for crops. The rest occurs on land where, from a climate perspective, it would be far more efficient to grow food crops — or where forests or other natural ecosystems could be restored. As a result, producing beef in the U.S. and Europe requires more than 3 times as much cropland per kilogram of edible protein as producing milk, eggs, pork and chicken — and 7 times more than producing beans.</p><p>Meanwhile, global demand for beef <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/beef-and-buffalo-meat-production-tonnes?tab=line\">continues to rise</a>, making it unrealistic to limit its production only to land unsuitable for crops or forests.

Indeed, emissions per kilogram of beef production have been declining for decades as farmers find ways to raise cattle more efficiently, using less land and fewer resources. Continued efficiency gains, grazing optimization, improved disease management, feed additives, and changes in animal breeding and genetics <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751731119003100\">can further reduce emissions</a>.</p><p>However, while some of these emissions-reducing technologies <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/reducing-agricultural-methane-new-solutions\">already exist</a>, adoption can be challenging due to costs and other constraints.

They can improve animal welfare, reduce antibiotic use, and boost soil health and on-farm biodiversity. But from a climate perspective, they generally require more land than conventional agriculture, resulting in higher total carbon costs per gram of protein.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/better-meat-sourcing-climate-environmental-impacts\">previous WRI research</a> found that the total carbon costs associated with grass-fed beef were more than double those of feedlot-finished beef, per kilogram. Organic beef’s total carbon costs were 28% greater than conventional beef.</p><p>Less research has explicitly studied regenerative grazing systems, which tend to focus on improving soil quality. But since many regenerative practices overlap with those in grass-fed or organic systems, the same emissions and land use concerns apply, though they can offer soil health and climate resilience benefits.</p><p>All of this said, practices used in conventional and alternative systems aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive, and both systems have room to improve. In conventional systems, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=105076\">introducing rotational grazing practices</a> prior to feedlot finishing could improve soil health and potentially help draw down carbon into soils. Grass-fed or organic operations could implement practices to improve productivity and reduce animal disease, which could lower land occupation and total carbon costs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"925\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"740\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"567\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"447\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"267\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cutting up beef in a slaughterhouse\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/beef-processing_0.jpg?VersionId=4waTpz8TigOpT0EqWUGCSKwFT_FYhHdu&itok=yjcp3JtB\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>While lower-emissions beef exists, it's very hard to find and purchase given market and other constraints. Photo by ASA studio/Shutterstock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Where can companies and individuals buy beef produced with the best practices to reduce emissions?</h3><p>Right now, it’s tricky.</p><p>Beef suppliers and purchasers often lack access to information on the production practices that most influence land occupation and emissions. For example, beef cattle typically live on multiple farms throughout their lives, with most emissions occurring when the calf is still nursing and grazing on pasture with its mother. Most large beef suppliers do not know where cattle were raised prior to the feedlot or slaughterhouse.  </p><p>This lack of supply chain transparency combined with a dearth of market-ready and traceable low-emissions options means that purchasers in the U.S. cannot yet identify which beef is produced using lower-emissions practices, relative to national or regional averages.  </p><h3>What about labels touting lower-emissions beef?</h3><p>In the U.S., labels are beginning to offer certified “carbon neutral” or “net zero” beef. These claims are largely based on carbon offsetting — either purchasing investments in renewable energy or counting carbon removals from growth of nearby trees. Only one of five labels we reviewed mentioned strategies to directly reduce production emissions.</p><p>It’s currently impossible to independently verify any claims made by these emerging labels. None of the U.S. labels we reviewed provide publicly available data (such as peer-reviewed life cycle assessments or other accounting analyses) to reflect their cattle’s full lifespan. Further data is also needed to evaluate each certification’s impacts on yields (or meat production per hectare) to understand the effect on total carbon costs.</p><p>Filling these data gaps is necessary to both verify labels’ claims and help purchasers find legitimately lower-emissions beef alongside their other animal welfare and sustainability goals.</p><p>But let’s be clear: While there are ways to lower beef’s emissions and credibly demonstrate that, it is highly unlikely that beef could ever be truly “net zero” in its climate impact.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1051\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"841\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"644\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"304\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Beef cattle lined up at a livestock market\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/cattle-market_0.jpg?VersionId=b__3zodH9OuiCO_n8L3z6w9_zCjT7onl&itok=toe5MwIs\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Beef cattle at a livestock market.

Food service companies can reduce their emissions by shifting toward <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/food-service-playbook-promoting-sustainable-food-choices\">plant-forward meals</a> with more diverse protein sources, such as legumes, nuts, seeds and alternative proteins. <br /> </li><li><strong>Balance priorities.</strong> Food purchasing organizations aiming to meet animal welfare, antibiotic use, or other sustainable sourcing commitments may wish to source grass-fed or organic beef. To meet climate commitments while doing so, they’ll need to source <em>even less</em> beef to offset any higher emissions from these alternative systems. Our report provides scenarios quantifying how much less beef is needed to meet multiple priorities at once.<br /> </li><li><strong>Engage producers to adopt climate-friendlier practices. </strong>Work directly with existing producers and suppliers to adopt practices that reduce emissions. Funding or partnering on projects that reduce emissions may help drive scale and adoption. <br /> </li></ol><p>Although labels that verify lower-emissions beef are not yet widely available, they may be in the future as data and supply chain traceability improve. In the meantime, food purchasing organizations <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/beef-purchasing-food-service-considerations-companies-balancing-climate-and-other-priorities\">can still make progress</a> on reducing their total emissions and help create a market for more sustainable and lower-emissions beef. While achieving carbon-neutral beef is likely unfeasible, reducing beef-related emissions as much as possible is an important tool in the climate toolbox. At the same time, efforts to support lower-emissions practices must go hand-in-hand with reducing overall demand for beef.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Not long ago, the idea of harvesting almond shells and sewage sludge to lock away climate-harming emissions might have sounded like something out of a science fiction movie. Today, it’s not only possible — it’s happening.</p><p>A new wave of startups is turning agricultural waste and forest residues into permanent carbon dioxide removal using a process known as biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS). These BiCRS startups sell carbon credits to companies seeking an efficient and verifiable tool for achieving climate targets. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/04/1048832/un-climate-report-carbon-removal-is-now-essential/\">Reducing emissions alone</a> won’t be enough <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/net-zero-ghg-emissions-questions-answered\">to reach net-zero</a> and climate-related goals, so carbon dioxide removal is becoming an important long-term method for achieving them.</p><p>The concept behind BiCRS is simple: As plants and trees grow, they soak up planet-warming carbon and store it in their stems, leaves, roots and wood; this carbon-rich organic material is known as biomass. Usually, biomass carbon gets released back into the atmosphere when plants and trees decompose or are burned. But BiCRS interrupts that cycle, capturing and permanently storing the carbon underground, preventing carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere.</p><p>In recent years, new research and BiCRS companies have proliferated, finding novel ways to supplement the increasing challenges the planet faces to reduce emissions. Globally, BiCRS is gaining momentum; in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/11/19/council-greenlights-eu-certification-framework-for-permanent-carbon-removals-carbon-farming-and-carbon-storage-in-products/\">recent legislation</a> established a framework for carbon removal certification and an EU-wide registry (to be implemented in 2028), while <a href=\"https://mission-innovation.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-27-BiCRS-Mapping-Explanatory-Document-v2.0-for-publication-2.pdf\">other countries</a> (like <a href=\"https://www.icef.go.jp/wp-content/themes/icef_new/pdf/roadmap/icef2020_roadmap.pdf\">Japan</a> and <a href=\"https://natural-resources.canada.ca/science-data/science-research/research-centres/integrated-biocarbon-sequestration-pathways-negative-emission-technologies\">Canada</a>) are investigating how to scale these technologies. In the U.S., there are a growing number of companies (one <a href=\"https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/carbon-removal-map-insight\">February 2025 report</a> counts 40, the highest of any country) dedicated to turning biomass wastes and residues into carbon removal and storage.</p><p>Among them are Corigin, Charm Industrial, Graphyte and Vaulted Deep. These innovative companies, which we profile below, illustrate different approaches to using waste or residue biomass and storing it underground to fight back against a warming planet.</p><h3>Corigin Solutions: Storing Carbon with Almond Shells</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.corigin.co/\">Corigin Solutions</a>, located in Merced, Calif., is aiming to turn agricultural waste from a carbon source to a carbon sink by collecting waste from the roughly 1.5 million acres of almond and other fruit orchards in California’s Central Valley.</p><p>The magnitude of waste after harvest is massive. For example, roughly <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/business/agriculture/article254616382.html\">3.8 billion pounds</a> of almond shells are leftover in the region annually.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-right half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"768\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"512\" />\n              <source height=\"768\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"512\" />\n              <source height=\"683\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"683\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"683\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A for\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/corigin-almond-shells_0.jpg?VersionId=IrDPcSVwOAI5yEZrlWFMAXGAPT65CBiv&itok=dZTl-x2V\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Corigin Solutions vaporizes 8 tons of almond shells every day to create biochar and bio-oil. Photo by Corigin Solutions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Every day, Corigin converts 8 tons of almond shells into usable products farmers can purchase <a href=\"https://wcngg.com/2024/07/11/trial-aims-to-show-biochar-contributions-to-soil-tree-health/\">to improve soil health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.corigin.co/coriphol-outdoor-results/\">increase plant growth</a> and <a href=\"https://nationalnutgrower.com/article/the-value-in-shell-waste\">reduce the need for fertilizers</a>, while also sequestering some of the waste underground. The company uses a process called pyrolysis, in which the agricultural waste is heated to 887 degrees Fahrenheit without oxygen in a closed, controllable chamber. During this process, the shells vaporize and then cool, leaving behind a charcoal-like substance, called biochar, and a type of oil, called bio-oil.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.corigin.co/corigin-home-copy/\">So far</a>, Corigin has produced 60 tons of what they call Corichar (their biochar product) for farmers and 18,000 liters of bio-oil for carbon storage. The process is relatively <a href=\"https://nationalnutgrower.com/article/the-value-in-shell-waste/\">efficient</a>, with each ton of biomass returning an 80% product yield broken down equally into biochar, Coriphol (their liquid fertilizer product) and bio-oil. Currently, there is some <a href=\"https://www.carbon-direct.com/insights/what-is-biochar-a-carbon-removal-solution-gaining-ground\">uncertainty</a> over the long-term durability of biochar’s carbon sequestration, so Corichar is not credited for carbon removal, but rather sold as a soil additive for farmers.</p><p>The company is currently using only a <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/business/agriculture/article254616382.html\">small portion</a> of almond shells, but is looking to scale up and <a href=\"https://nationalnutgrower.com/article/the-value-in-shell-waste/\">expand to other types of agricultural wastes</a> from walnuts, rice and citrus. Though the cost of bio-oil carbon dioxide removal is high, Corigin’s methods can provide alternative uses for agricultural waste, which is normally burned, and support a green business opportunity supporting local farmers and the community in Merced at large.</p><h3>Charm Industrial: Flipping the Script on Oil Extraction</h3><p>Charm Industrial is taking advantage of retired and abandoned oil wells left behind by oil and gas companies. Instead of pumping oil <em>out </em>from deep below the ground, Charm is returning carbon-rich oil generated by biomass from forestry and agricultural residues back underground to be sealed away.</p><p>Like Corigin, Charm relies on pyrolysis to turn residue biomass into bio-oil, but their approach to this is a bit unorthodox. Instead of one central facility, Charm is developing mobile pyrolizers, which are small enough to be transported to feedstock locations, enabling a faster market response and ability to reach locations without access to biomass processing. Each pyrolyzer produces <a href=\"https://charmindustrial.com/blog/charm-duo\">0.5 metric tons of bio-oil</a> for each metric ton of biomass. Given the high cost of transporting biomass over long distances, this is a particularly important innovation for the BiCRS industry.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-right half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"400\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Bio-oil is poured from one container into another.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/charm-industrial-bio-oil_0.jpg?VersionId=ggYt0Yu9ktB9f7HBQBRFiarrLDv6sEGW&itok=tL7I5Arr\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Charm Industrial creates bio-oil using residues likes logs and branches from wildfire mitigation projects. Photo by Charm Industrial. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Charm currently uses residues, like branches and small logs from wildfire mitigation projects in western U.S. forests, but Charm is also testing other feedstocks, such as corn stover (the leaves, stalks and cobs left over after corn is harvested) and certain invasive species that are otherwise problematic for ecosystems. These feedstocks are turned into bio-oil on-site, which can then be much more easily transported to their injection sites.</p><p>Charm, like many other BiCRS companies, uses a third-party carbon registry, Isometric, to independently scrutinize their feedstocks to ensure that the carbon removal does not have unintended negative impacts on the climate or environment. As of 2025, Charm has sequestered almost 12,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).</p><p>The startup received <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/charm-industrial-raises-100m-in-series-b-ramp-up-bio-oil-sequestration/\">$100 million in initial funding</a> in 2023 and has since <a href=\"https://time.com/6328318/charm-industrial-peter-reinhardt-carbon-capture/\">attracted carbon removal purchases from major companies,</a> including <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/frontier-signs-53m-in-carbon-offtake-agreements-with-charm-industrial/\">tech giants</a> and large banks. While there are still challenges for ensuring that carbon credits equate to real, permanent carbon sequestration, Charm focuses on <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/the-logic-behind-the-ledger-charm-shares-the-structure-of-their-reliable-cdr-reporting/\">transparency</a> in its operations and is the first company to receive a <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/isometric-issues-first-ccp-labeled-credits-after-icvcm-approved-its-methodology/\">higher-standard label</a> by Isometric.</p><p>By using abandoned oil wells as injection sites, Charm is repurposing existing infrastructure for new, greener uses. For neighboring communities, each injection site employs eight to 10 people and can operate for up to 10 years, depending on reservoir properties.</p><p>There are some <a href=\"https://time.com/6328318/charm-industrial-peter-reinhardt-carbon-capture/\">doubts</a> about how bio-oil injection can scale; however, Charm’s fast and flexible approach makes it possible to deliver immediately on substantial carbon capture.</p><h3>Graphyte: Finding a Simpler Storage Process</h3><p>Graphyte, a carbon removal company in Arkansas, is using a <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/graphyte-secures-30m-funding-for-innovative-carbon-removal-tech/\">simple, physical process</a> to compress residues from local sawmill and rice hulls from local agriculture and then burying them underground. First, the biomass is dried extensively and condensed into solid blocks to reduce water and oxygen. Next, these bricks are sealed in a polymer barrier and stored in heavily monitored underground pits. While the barrier is designed to keep moisture and microbes away to prevent decomposition, the material of the barrier and how it performs long-term is undisclosed.</p><p>Unlike Charm and Corigin, this process doesn’t involve chemical transformation, keeping it simple, accessible and low-cost. Therefore, Graphyte can easily expand the feedstock types they use and deliver carbon removal quickly. After receiving $30 million in funding last year, Graphyte is expanding, expecting to remove nearly <a href=\"https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2024-08-05/worlds-largest-carbon-removal-plant-sets-its-roots-in-pine-bluff\">50,000 tons</a> of CO2 by early 2026. The company is also planning to open several more facilities in 2026 and 2027.</p><p>Because of their speed and simplicity, Graphyte is currently able to <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/exclusive-worlds-largest-carbon-removal-plant-is-about-to-open/\">sell carbon credits</a>, at $150/ton, an already-low number that may decrease as they expand. Graphyte’s first customer, <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/11/28/airline-strikes-deal-to-bury-carbon-in-biomass-bricks-00128744\">American Airlines</a>, purchased 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide removal in 2023.</p><p>Biomass burial is by far the simplest method, but the process is still very new and research is not as developed as other carbon dioxide removal methods. However, there are already standard practices and approaches to life-cycle assessments or monitoring, reporting and verification methods, which are common practices used to assure carbon removal is actually happening. Graphyte, whose <a href=\"https://registry.isometric.com/project/prj_1J4P33N6W1S0RKE2#removal-method\">carbon credits</a> are issued by Isometric, adheres to <a href=\"https://registry.isometric.com/protocol/subsurface-biomass#sources-and-reference-standards--methodologies\">their BiCRS protocol</a>. Burial projects must be careful to evaluate the potential tradeoffs from disturbing large swaths of land. Graphyte minimizes land use impacts by using only degraded land for carbon storage, such as their Arkansas project which is sited on an old gravel mine.</p><h3>Vaulted Deep: Locking Away Waste</h3><p>Across the U.S., cities, agricultural areas and industrial facilities face growing volumes of organic waste, such as sewage and agricultural by-products, that don’t have safe methods for long-term disposal. Vaulted Deep is tackling some of these challenges by collecting and injecting wastes deep underground, locking away emissions and contaminants, such as PFAS (synthetic compounds known as “forever chemicals”) that can be harmful to human health.</p><p>Since 2023, the Houston-based company has diverted sludge away from disposal methods that pollute land and potentially impact groundwater. The sludge gets turned into a pumpable slurry and locked into a layer of rock deep below groundwater in a manner that does not cause seismic activity. </p><p>Because there is minimal processing, Vaulted’s methods are energy-efficient and can operate with a variety of feedstocks, such as excess manure or paper sludge. At Vaulted’s flagship Great Plains facility in Kansas, the company repurposes old salt caverns for its safe geologic storage and provides a new reliable disposal solution for municipalities like the City of Derby and for nearby farmers who make more manure than can be productively applied to land.</p><p>In 2024, Vaulted Deep signed a <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/vaulted-deep-delivers-carbon-removal-to-frontier-in-record-time/\">large deal with the conglomerate Frontier</a>, a group of large companies created to pool investments into carbon removal efforts, and secured a little over $30 million in venture capital funding. In July of this year, Vaulted also secured a 12-year <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vaulted-deep-signs-deal-with-microsoft-to-remove-carbon-via-waste-management-infrastructure-302507387.html\">deal with Microsoft</a> to sequester almost 5 million tons of CO2, indicating the tech company is making a strong bet on Vaulted scaling up to deliver on these credits.</p><p>To date, Vaulted Deep has sequestered over 32,000 tons of CO2.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1051\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"841\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"644\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"304\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A worker at Vaulted Deep's Great Plain facility inspects equipment.\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/vaulted-deep-great-plains-facility_0.jpg?VersionId=iJHtmJZEym10Em68h76z0nPM7FTbLMGs&itok=-7p8aJJ0\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>At Vaulted Deep's Great Plains facility, the company turns sewage and agricultural by-products into a substance that can be locked into a layer of rock deep below groundwater.

However, there is still a long way to go to supplement slowing or inadequate global emissions reductions.</p><p>The absence of sufficient policy support in the U.S. has made scaling carbon dioxide removal an uphill battle. Moreover, the lack of a singular standard and protocol for verification increases confusion among carbon market buyers. This is especially important considering the controversy in recent years about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe\">low-integrity carbon credits</a> issued by non-reputable companies that has shaken confidence in the carbon market.</p><p>Additionally, industrywide, there is a long lag between purchase of carbon removals and delivery of climate impact. Of the 4 million tons of carbon sequestration that’s already been purchased by companies, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/is-carbon-removal-critical-save-planet-or-just-hot-air-2023-10-02/\">only 2.6% of these credits have been delivered</a>. The sector is still relatively new and many carbon removal technologies are complex. Most buyers have long timelines for carbon removal delivery, expecting sequestration to occur over many years. All carbon dioxide removal technologies carry a risk of contracting removals that never materialize.</p><p>BiCRS companies, however, benefit from relatively shorter timelines due to their ability to start storing carbon relatively quickly, compared to larger, more technologically intensive approaches like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\">direct air capture</a>.</p><p>Underlying all these concerns is the bigger question of who should be buying carbon credits in the first place. Some fear that <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/separate-climate-targets-carbon-dioxide-removal\">over-reliance on carbon dioxide removal</a> will take momentum away from necessary emissions reductions, and many argue that it should be reserved for only the hardest-to-abate sectors where emissions reductions are extremely challenging, like heavy industry or aviation.</p><p>Instead, large tech companies with deep pockets, who are trying to achieve their climate goals while opening up energy-intensive data centers, have been the major carbon credit buyers, which reflects the current high costs of credits. Moreover, the long timelines of delivery entail risks of companies claiming climate credits before they are actually realized. Policy support can make participation in carbon removal markets easier for buyers, like the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildeluna/2025/07/22/the-uk-just-created-a-regulated-market-for-carbon-removals/\">UK’s plan</a> to expand their emissions trading market to include carbon removals, but guardrails are needed to ensure BiCRS is deployed responsibly. As BiCRS scales, research and policy around appropriate guardrails must continue and evolve to avoid claims of greenwashing, which could discredit the industry.</p><p>There may also be some unintended consequences to BiCRS and climate impacts of diverting wastes from existing uses must be considered. Many BiCRS companies, including the ones highlighted, could face competition from other sectors who also use wastes and residues. Moreover, facing the challenge of reaching net-zero goals, sectors ranging from transportation and energy to chemicals and heavy industry are all prospecting how they can use biomass materials. This demand for biomass resources, without coordination, will likely far outstrip the sustainable supply, and could drive up prices.</p><p>Despite the many challenges, the emerging BiCRS sector is helping accelerate progress on carbon removal, offering simple ways to lock away the carbon stored in organic waste. The variety of approaches show flexibility, and a potential to scale to make meaningful contributions to mitigate climate change, especially in helping offset emissions from sectors that are difficult to decarbonize.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://africa.wri.org/initiatives/circular-food-systems-rwanda\">Circular Food Systems for Rwanda</a> (CIRF) project held its annual learning event from Oct. 21-Oct. 23, 2025, in Kigali, Rwanda. The main objective was to reflect on lessons and envision next steps as the project prepares to conclude in December 2026. During the event, CIRF partners and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) shared key achievements from the project, including increased revenues and new jobs created through the development of circular products. CIRF's multi-stakeholder policy platform also influenced circular food systems policy, resulting in Rwanda's adoption of two International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards on circularity and the inclusion of circular economy principles in three key government strategic documents, including the Fifth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (STA5).</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">CIRF's Impacts on Small Businesses</p><p class=\"secondary\">Through CIRF's support, 11 SMEs developed new circular products, such as pellets, compost and bakery items; 10 created new income streams by selling circular products; and nine reduced operational costs. In addition, 73 new direct jobs were created linked to circular product development through the adoption of circular business models.</p></div><p>WRI and partners are now preparing to scale CIRF's impact across Africa, establishing a replicable model for transformation through an initiative called <a href=\"https://africa.wri.org/initiatives/accelerating-circular-economy-food\">Accelerating the Circular Economy for Food</a> (ACE4Food). As the project moves from pilot stage to a multi-country initiative, the aim will shift from supporting individual enterprises to engaging government institutions and influencing policies, markets and value chains. This makes systems-level measurement essential to understand whether transformation is taking place, avoid unintended trade-offs and reinforce change across value chain actors.</p><p>With scale in mind, a key question that emerged throughout the learning event was how to capture, reflect and report on the systemic impact of projects such as ACE4Food. The puzzle remains: <strong>How do we really know if food systems are becoming more circular?</strong></p><p>It's a question that many organizations are beginning to ask, and there's no easy answer. CIRF tracks impact mostly at the level of individual businesses, capturing valuable but narrow insights. What's often missing from these types of projects are practical ways to measure the system-level impacts of circularity, such as reductions in waste and emissions, policy change, improved nutrition and more resilient communities.</p><h3>Inside our Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Impact Session</h3><p>To explore these measurement challenges more intentionally, we convened peers and funders for a dedicated MEL discussion during the CIRF learning event. Monitoring and evaluation experts unpacked challenges, shared best practices, and explored how to move toward a more aligned and meaningful way of measuring circular food systems.</p><p>The panel included MEL experts from IKEA Foundation, Resonance, WRI, IITA and SNV.</p><p>The panel of experts discussed challenges such as the resource-intensive nature of collecting quantitative data on waste and emissions; the disproportionate burden placed on entrepreneurs and small farmers in terms of data collection and sharing; and the difficulty of attributing results to specific interventions or projects.</p><p>Most panel participants acknowledged the difficulty of finding the right balance between individual and systems-level impact measurements. Current efforts are concentrated on policy changes, with the future aim of broader systemic evaluation.</p><p>Key obstacles include the lack of collective measurement frameworks and user-friendly tools across programs. There is also uncertainty around how to track complex changes, like market dynamics and policy adoption. Participants discussed practical solutions, including building SME capacity for self-monitoring, leveraging multi-stakeholder platforms to influence government policy alignment (particularly with Rwanda's nationally determined contribution), and shifting from attribution to contribution models that harvest outcomes and signs of change.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Farm workers tending compost heaps. \" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/rwanda-farmers-cirf_0.JPG?VersionId=p7xwXsRgnpfzdLIzvGeVnIvaIjYEBs8a&itok=Yyvym4KB\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Workers tending compost heaps at Elim Plus Farm in Nyagatare, Rwanda.

The process typically starts by collecting stories of change across stakeholders and then verifying those changes. At the individual level, these might be changes in knowledge, behavior, skills or business metrics. At the system level, they may include shifts in relationships, rules, dynamics or broader patterns. The next step is to identify how a specific intervention contributed to the change.</p><h4>Contribution analysis</h4><p>This approach mirrors the outcome-harvesting process but is anchored in a theory of change. Contribution analysis examines whether an intervention followed the expected pathway and contributed to the expected outcomes. For systems-level change, contribution pathways are more complex, often requiring documentation of behavioral or relational shifts and consideration of alternative explanations, including political turnover or other external forces.</p><h4>Market systems framework</h4><p>A market systems framework is a way of understanding how a market actually functions by looking beyond individual actors to the wider set of relationships, exchanges, incentives, and formal or informal rules that shape a value chain. Rather than focusing only on outputs or short-term results, it helps identify who interacts with whom; what motivates different actors; and how power, information and resources flow through the system. This approach often draws on tools such as outcome harvesting to document what has changed over time and social network analysis to reveal patterns of collaboration and influence. By paying attention to small, incremental shifts in behavior, coordination and decision-making, a market systems framework supports sense-making in complex environments and helps practitioners understand how broader change is emerging, even before large or visible outcomes take place.</p><h3>What Signals of Systems Change Might Look Like</h3><p>Based on these approaches, we asked one central question: <strong>If a food system is becoming more circular, what are the tangible results?</strong></p><p>Our panel outlined several early \"signals\" that can hint at whether circularity is beginning to take root in a system long before major policy milestones or market shifts appear:</p><ol><li><strong>Changing behaviors and norms: </strong>Many systemic changes begin with people, rather than policies. Signals might include growing consumer interest in circular products, farmers becoming more aware of circular practices, or knowledge-sharing spreading organically through communities. These changes often show up first in attitudes and relationships before hard numbers.</li><li><strong>Environmental practices as the default:</strong> Early indicators of environmental transformation are often subtle, like more farmers adopting waste-to-value practices, improvements in water use and recycling, or local experimentation with regenerative inputs. These shifts point to a system in which circularity is no longer a niche idea but part of routine practice.</li><li><strong>Market evolution:</strong> Economic signals, like increased commercialization of circular products, new financing models, or financial institutions showing stronger understanding of circularity, suggest the market is beginning to reward circular behavior. These signals don't require massive industry overhauls; they often start as small but telling adjustments in incentives.</li><li><strong>Governance and policy alignment: </strong>The strongest signals of systems change often appear in the enabling environment. This includes circularity showing up in the language of public officials, broadening participation in multi-stakeholder platforms, or new policy proposals aligned with circular economy goals. These signals are often incremental and difficult to capture before formal policies are enacted, which can create challenges in identification.</li><li><strong>Multidimensionality: </strong>Genuine systems change must show coherence across social, environmental and economic progress rather than spikes in one area. It's important not to over-index on one domain (for example, economic growth) and miss unintended trade-offs.</li></ol><p>Each indicator on its own does not confirm systems transformation. But in combination, they help practitioners sense whether circularity is beginning to take root and where reinforcing interventions may be needed. These indicators also reflect the reality that systems change is often detectable long before it can be conclusively measured.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Waste recycling bins at a farm.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/cirf-waste-separation_0.JPG?VersionId=XMfwHzFGz.lQyNfV8Iqpr3CYVGJ59ye8&itok=RnGrfOxA\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Waste recycling bins at Elim Plus Farm in Nyagatare, Rwanda.

The discussion built on the success of circularity projects at the SME and policy level in Rwanda and reflected on the larger ambition of systems transformation. It is clear that the tools and frameworks to measure circularity at scale are not currently accessible in the project but are beginning to develop.</p><p>Ultimately, answering the initial question - \"How do we really know if food systems are becoming more circular?\" - will require collaboration and shared learning. Measuring systems change, rather than only individual outcomes, will be essential to understanding whether this work is contributing to real transformation.</p><p>Several questions remain to help frame further work:</p><ul><li>What does systemic change look like in a specific context?</li><li>What would demonstrate proof of transformative change in agri-food systems?</li><li>What tools and lenses can help monitor the systems-level outcomes and impacts of circular interventions?</li></ul><div>With so many interventions working toward similar goals in the same region, we want to continue exploring how best to align, coordinate, and accelerate circular food systems transformation.

      "description": "<p>As the U.S. federal government continues to roll back crucial environment and climate legislation, California’s climate leadership is more important than ever — including its policies to scale up <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-ways-remove-carbon-pollution-sky\">carbon dioxide removal</a> (CDR), which includes a suite of technological processes that remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. CDR is necessary to address greenhouse gas emissions from hard to abate sources, which along with deep emissions reductions, can achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>As the <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/04/23/california-is-now-the-4th-largest-economy-in-the-world/\">fourth largest economy</a> in the world and an engine of innovation, California has the economic and entrepreneurial capacity to incubate a large enough CDR industry to drive lower costs and learning-by-doing, increasing the likelihood that other states or national governments will adopt similar policies. California also has a comprehensive climate policy framework that will ensure that CDR <em>supplements</em> —rather than substitutes for — deep emissions reductions.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>California's Climate Legislation</strong></p><ul><li>* The <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1279\">2022 Climate Crisis Act</a> requires at least an 85% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2045.<br /> </li><li>* California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) 2022 <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/ab-32-climate-change-scoping-plan/2022-scoping-plan-documents\">Scoping Plan</a> lays out a path for 85% emissions reductions and includes CDR targets (7 million tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030; 75 million tons annually by 2045) to neutralize the remaining hard-to-abate emissions.<br /> </li><li>* As part of <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB905\">SB 905</a> implementation, work is underway at CARB to develop protocols for how CDR projects are conducted and measured.<br /> </li><li>* <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB840\">SB 840</a> allocates $85 million for fiscal year 2026-2027 from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for climate-focused projects that advance California’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045.<br /> </li><li>* <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1207\">AB 1207</a> extends California’s Cap and Invest program to 2045.</li></ul></div><p>In September, the California legislature passed a <a href=\"https://www.catf.us/2025/11/balancing-climate-ambition-affordability-reflecting-californias-2025-legislative-session/\">substantial package</a> of climate and energy legislation, which included an unmistakable signal of support for CDR via a bill known as the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB643\">Carbon Dioxide Removal Purchase Program (SB 643)</a>, which saw nearly unanimous legislative support. SB 643 would have established a $50 million grant program to fund innovative, verifiable CDR projects in California no later than 2035. It would have also mandated matching private sector funds, ultimately creating a $100 million program.</p><p>However, when SB 643 reached Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, he vetoed it. While still recognizing the importance of CDR to achieving the state’s net-zero goals, he <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SB-643-Veto.pdf\">noted</a> that SB 643’s program could be implemented using funds allocated under a previously passed bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB840\">SB 840</a>, which allocates $85 million for climate-focused innovation and deployment projects that advance California’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. This legislation expands on the state’s suite of climate policies helping define the role of CDR.</p><p>Although it was surprising and disappointing to have SB 643 vetoed, California policymakers have other tools that can and should be used to achieve the goals of the legislation.</p><h3>Directing State Funds Toward CDR Sends an Essential Demand Signal</h3><p>Outside of the<a href=\"https://autl.assembly.ca.gov/system/files/2025-07/sb-643-caballero_0.pdf\"> overwhelming bipartisan legislator support</a> for SB 643, numerous private sector stakeholders, including CDR project developers and environmental non-government organizations, showed support. Leading voluntary carbon market buyers were encouraged by the prospect of high-quality carbon credits funded by the program.  </p><p>This highlights an innovative ecosystem ready to build and the momentum echoes the positive market response observed from the U.S. Department of Energy’s $35 million <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/fecm/funding-notice-carbon-dioxide-removal-purchase-pilot-prize\">CDR Purchase Pilot Prize</a> launched in 2023 — the first instance of government policy to directly purchase CDR credits. Even without a mandate, at least one private sector buyer, Google, made a <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/pledge-to-support-carbon-removal-solutions/\">public pledge</a> to match 100% of the prize awards, setting off a broader wave of demand signals, which in turn enabled project developers to raise capital. Although this program is no longer active, the Department of Energy had selected <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-dioxide-removal-purchase-pilot-prize-phase-1-semifinalists\">12 companies</a> as semi-finalists in mid-2024, most of which were California-based, further demonstrating the state’s leadership for CDR know-how and project development.</p><p>Without an immediate, reliable demand signal backed by public funds, California faces a real risk that its homegrown companies will relocate out of the state or stall in the so-called “valley of death” between innovation and commercialization. Industry experts agree the voluntary carbon market alone cannot scale CDR solutions sufficiently by mid-century, in part because the vast majority — 80% — of voluntary credits to date have been <a href=\"https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards\">contracted by a single corporate buyer</a> — Microsoft. Public policy-driven demand is indispensable for meeting California’s climate goals and demonstrating leadership that other states can emulate.</p><h3>California Must Act Now</h3><p>Newsom’s support for this year’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/19/governor-newsom-signs-historic-package-of-bipartisan-legislation-saving-billions-on-electric-bills-stabilizing-gas-market-and-cutting-pollution/\">climate legislation package</a> underscores the strategic importance of <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/10/carbon-management-coming-soon-to-california-governor-newsom-signs-legislation-paving-way-for-climate-pollution-cutting-technology/\">carbon management</a> (which includes CDR) to California’s economy. A back-of-the-envelope estimate (assuming about $100/ton of carbon dioxide) suggests CDR could become an $8 billion industry in California by 2045, if the state achieves the ambitious goal of removing 75 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The California Air Resources Board (CARB), the state's environmental regulator, is charged with deploying pathways and market mechanisms to realize this abatement wedge with high-quality CDR — an imperative that calls for proactive use of currently available funds in the <a href=\"https://www.caclimateinvestments.ca.gov/about-cci\">Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund </a>(GGRF) for climate technology innovation under SB 840 to signal demand immediately.</p><p>If the California budget allocated a portion of the GGRF slated for climate innovation technologies explicitly toward CDR procurement, it would provide a necessary market foundation. The legislature could require that this immediate demand signal be matched by private investment, unlocking capital for developers and yielding valuable lessons to inform ongoing protocol and regulatory development. In 2026, the legislature should consider multi-year appropriations to ensure there is continuous funding available to support CDR deployment, building on any funding already allocated in fiscal year 2026-2027.</p><p>In implementing a CDR program through the GGRF, CARB should follow the guidelines that were included in the vetoed SB 643 bill, including supporting a diverse portfolio of high-quality CDR approaches, ensuring that CDR results in long-term carbon sequestration, requiring community benefits, and ensuring that any use of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/sustainable-biomass-carbon-removal\">biomass</a> is limited to responsibly sourced wastes or residues. After all, California’s legislature overwhelmingly endorsed these safeguards when it passed SB 643.</p><p>California stands at a pivotal crossroads: Equipped with policy frameworks, legislative momentum and a vibrant CDR ecosystem, it now needs decisive and immediate public sector action to translate intent into impact. The clock is ticking toward CARB’s target to remove 7 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2030, and the state must act to meet its net-zero goals and secure its leadership in scalable, durable carbon removal.</p><p>How California leads in this space will also signal opportunity for what other states and nations can do, helping shape the global future of safe and high-quality CDR.</p><p><em>Deepika Nagabhushan is a senior policy researcher at </em><a href=\"https://project2030.blog/\"><em>Project2030</em></a><em> where she conceptualizes new approaches for carbon dioxide removal deployment in California that empower the local public and enable California to exceed its 2030 and 2045 climate targets.</em></p>",

Beans, lentils, soy, nuts, and seeds are great sources of protein and often other important nutrients such as fiber and iron while being far better for the planet than foods like beef and lamb.</p><p>\"Climate-conscious consumers and food businesses have more and more options for which protein-rich foods to prioritize. With so many good plant-based options available today, choosing less resource-intensive proteins is an easy and practical step people can take for both themselves and the climate.”</p>",
