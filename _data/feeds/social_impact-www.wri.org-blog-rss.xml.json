      "description": "<p>We face a paradox: Nature underpins the global economy — providing clean air, water regulation, flood protection, and pollination — yet remains largely invisible in most economic and financial decisions. This is not because its value is insignificant, but because nature is not seen as a critical asset that’s necessary for the economy.</p><p>The failure to fully recognize and embed nature’s value in economic and financial decisions has contributed to rapid ecosystem degradation and climate instability that now threatens economic resilience, food security, human health and quality of life.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/staff-climate-notes/Issues/2024/10/01/Embedded-in-Nature-Nature-Related-Economic-and-Financial-Risks-and-Policy-Considerations-555072\">According to the International Monetary Fund</a>, nature loss is financially material in both directions: economic activity degrades ecosystems and ecosystem decline undermines economic growth, drives inflationary pressures and threatens financial stability. For example, banks face significant vulnerability to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss because many borrowers and assets depend on — and operate in — nature-dependent sectors such as agriculture, forestry and water-intensive manufacturing.</p><p>As ecosystems degrade, costs rise, yields fall and supply chains are disrupted, reducing borrowers’ abilities to repay loans, which thereby increases systemic risk. In agriculture, the economic value of crop production is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36515549/\">12% to 31% lower</a> due to declining pollination as insects, birds and other pollinators succumb to climate change and other human-driven pressures such as land-use change, intensive farming techniques and harmful pesticides.</p><p>By embedding nature into balance sheets, countries and companies can recognize nature’s value explicitly in financial terms and better manage both physical and transition risks — strengthening economic stability while fostering more inclusive, nature-based growth. Furthermore, properly valuing nature can reduce risks that threaten overall economic and financial stability, while supporting long-term prosperity, <a href=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_IHLEG_Making-Natural-Capital-Count_fullreport-1.pdf\">particularly for emerging markets and developing countries</a> that are rich in natural capital but often lack resources and incentives to protect or leverage them sustainably.  </p><p>Experts, financial institutions and companies are increasingly exposed to nature-related risks across their operations and supply chains and are starting to recognize the need for putting nature on their balance sheets as the next frontier of risk management and long-term value creation, allowing businesses and governments to recognize, measure and manage their dependencies and impact on natural systems.</p><p>This article addresses why that matters, particularly from a private sector perspective, and introduces the Nature on the Balance Sheet Initiative, a coalition formed by the <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/\">Capitals Coalition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelandbankinggroup.com/\">The Landbanking Group</a>, <a href=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/\">Systemiq</a> and the <a href=\"https://cgc.ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/\">Center for Global Commons</a>, which seeks to make this transition possible. WRI is collaborating with <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/project/nature-on-the-balance-sheet/\">the Nature on the Balance Sheet Initiative</a> as part of its broader efforts to identify and advance innovative nature-finance mechanisms and investment vehicles aimed at scaling finance for nature.</p><div class=\"callout aligncenter\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Key Terms for Natural Capital Accounting</strong></p><p><strong>Natural Capital</strong>: The stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources that combine to yield a flow of benefits (i.e., ecosystem services) to people. The term highlights that nature is a form of capital asset, comparable to produced capital (roads, buildings) and human capital (knowledge, skills).</p><p><strong>Ecosystems</strong>: Both living components (plants, animals, microorganisms) and the physical environment that interact to provide services to people. In accounting terms, ecosystems are treated as assets described through ecosystem extent and condition accounts.</p><p><strong>Ecosystem Services</strong>: The flows of <em>benefits</em> that people obtain from ecosystems. These are typically classified into: provisioning services (e.g., food, timber, water), regulating and maintenance services (e.g., flood control, climate regulation, soil fertility, pollination) and cultural services (e.g., recreation, aesthetic, spiritual value).</p><p><strong>Nature</strong>-<strong>positive</strong>: A term used to describe an ambition that goes beyond “no net loss” or “net positive impact” toward a future where nature is visibly and measurably improved in absolute terms. While there is not yet a clear or consistent definition, “nature-positive” is best understood not as a target for individual organizations but as a shared goal to halt and reverse nature loss.</p></div><h3>Understanding Nature on a Balance Sheet: Foundations and Emerging Practice  </h3><p>Putting nature on the balance sheet is a figurative way to recognize natural capital as an economic driver in business, finance and government decision-making. It helps to illustrate the ways nature’s condition impacts financial performance and economic strategy, ultimately enhancing natural capital stocks over time.  </p><p>It systematically measures and values how companies, investors and economies depend on and impact natural systems (forests, water, soils, biodiversity, climate regulation) and incorporate those values into financial statements, risk assessments and investment decisions. Making nature-related outcomes visible enables capital allocators to better understand how these dependencies affect business performance and resilience. This, in turn, helps direct finance toward activities that generate measurable nature-positive outcomes while managing exposure to physical and transition risks, reducing the likelihood of stranded assets (economic assets that may lose their value in response to environmental concerns) and fostering more resilient value chains and economies.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Nature on a Balance Sheet Resources</strong></p><p>For practical guidance on this topic, explore the following resources:</p><ul><li>• <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Towards-a-Roadmap-for-Putting-Nature-on-the-Balance-Sheet.pdf\">The Roadmap for Putting Nature on the Balance Sheet</a><br /> </li><li>• <a href=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_IHLEG_Making-Natural-Capital-Count_fullreport-1.pdf\">Making Natural Capital Account: An Investment Agenda</a></li></ul><p> </p></div><p>Historically, natural capital accounting has focused on national and subnational public systems, based on the intellectual and methodological foundations developed over several decades. The United Nations’ System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) was first introduced in 1993 to link environmental data with national economic accounts. Meanwhile, the concept of “natural capital” gained traction in the 1990s as ecological economists such as <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2385849\">Robert Costanza and Herman E. Daly</a> argued that nature should be treated as a productive asset providing essential goods and services to human well-being and economic growth.</p><p>The SEEA Central Framework, adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 2012, became the first global statistical standard for environmental-economic accounting. It focuses on the flows of nature’s goods to the economy (e.g., inputs, products and residuals), nature’s individual assets (e.g., water, energy), as well as economic activity related to the environment (e.g., nature-related expenditures).</p><p>The SEEA Ecosystem Accounting, adopted in 2021, expanded SEEA’s measurements to include regulating and cultural functions of ecosystems, by proposing measurement of ecosystems, their condition and provision of services.</p><p>Together, they offer a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041622000092\">globally consistent approach to measuring</a> the environment-economy relationship. The SEEA has already been used to support public policy making in high-priority areas such as climate change and environmental sustainability. However, as the framework is still novel, the producers and potential users of accounts must improve the understanding of SEEA's relevance to ensure a more systematic use for <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/public-policy-uses-of-the-seea-stocks-and-flows-accounts_116778b3-en.html\">informing policies</a>.</p><p>There is now <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2024/html/ecb.ebart202406_02~ae87ac450e.en.html\">explicit</a> <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/sustainable1/en/insights/special-editorial/how-the-world-s-largest-companies-depend-on-nature-and-biodiversity\">recognition</a> that most companies, either directly or indirectly, depend on nature — for water access, soil productivity, pollination and stable climates — while also contributing to nature loss through land-use change, supply-chain impacts and emissions. High-profile financial institutions such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are beginning to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/financial-sector-nature-risks-nature-based-solutions\">integrate nature into investment decisions</a>, reflecting a growing understanding that financial performance is inseparable from the state of natural systems. This growing urgency to manage nature-related risks and dependencies is shifting attention from public-sector accounting to corporate balance sheets and capital markets. Although <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320724004786\">still nascent</a>, there is increasing recognition of the private sector’s critical role in assessing, accounting for and integrating natural capital into business and finance, and of investors’ influence in driving this transition.</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Corporate Benefits of Putting Nature on the Balance Sheet</strong></p><p>For the private sector practitioners, putting nature on the balance sheet offers the following benefits:</p><ol><li><strong>Stronger Risk Management</strong>: For instance, recording restored wetlands or forests as productive assets or disclosing liabilities for degraded land, water or biodiversity loss. Many sectors, including agriculture, energy and water-dependent industries such as artificial intelligence, rely on nature’s regulating services. Failing to account for these dependencies can leave companies exposed to both physical (e.g., resource scarcity, supply-chain disruption due to nature loss and natural disasters) and transition risks (as policies, markets and consumer preferences shift).</li><li><strong>Better Decision-Making</strong>: Embedding natural-capital metrics into accounts can improve long-term planning and inform trade-offs about land use, production and investment, enabling companies to align financial returns with ecological resilience and avoid stranded assets.</li><li><strong>Increased Revenue and Innovation</strong>: Properly valuing ecosystem services can create new income streams, such as through clear metrics and long-term value for buyers of ecosystems, biodiversity credits, nature-linked contracts and nature-based financial products (e.g., Natural Asset Companies, parametric insurance for ecosystem services) that can reduce costs, diversify revenues and strengthen resilience.</li><li><strong>Demonstrated Industry Leadership</strong>: Embedding nature on the balance sheet can signal genuine industry leadership by moving beyond commitments to measurable action. Demonstrating how nature-related performance contributes to financial outcomes positions a company as a frontrunner in transparency and accountability. This not only differentiates them in client and investor engagement but also strengthens trust among regulators, communities and supply-chain partners.</li></ol></div><h3>Demonstrating Nature on the Balance Sheet in Practice </h3><p>While the concept of adding nature to balance sheets in the private sector is still emerging, several pioneers across different sectors are already integrating natural capital value into financial and strategic decision-making. For example, Forico, a forestry company in Tasmania, used natural capital accounting and demonstrated that when ecosystem services are valued, the broader contribution is roughly <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/3-ways-to-factor-nature-into-balance-sheets/\">four times higher</a> than what appears on its conventional balance sheet. The company <a href=\"https://tnfd.global/knowledge-bank/forico-harvests-670-million-with-sustainable-forestry/\">tripled in value</a> before being acquired by three pension funds for <a href=\"https://tnfd.global/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Forico_1026_FINAL.pdf\">more than $670 million in 2023</a>.</p><p>The Nature on the Balance Sheet Initiative has been working with three early-stage projects in agriculture, mining and financial services. These pioneering efforts, which are still being implemented, provide proof-of-concept examples that other companies can learn from.</p><h4>Belterra</h4><p>Belterra, founded in 2020, works with smallholder farmers in Brazil’s Amazon and Atlantic forests to shift degraded pastureland to biodiverse agroforestry systems that improve productivity — such as for cacao production — while helping conserve critical biomes. Its model combines technical assistance, blended finance and commercial partnerships to support transitions at scale. In its first two years, Belterra has established <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_UpLink_Annual_Impact_Report_2024.pdf\">1,800 hectares of biodiverse agroforestry areas</a> and protected 18,000 hectares of land, with a target to restore 40,000 hectares of Brazilian forests by 2030.</p><p>Belterra’s practice shows that compared to monoculture, agroforestry plots show 55% less soil erosion, more than 50% less nutrient run-off, better water retention, higher biodiversity and more than 2.6 metric tons more of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestration per hectare per year compared to degraded pasture or monoculture. These ecological gains support higher long-term yields, greater climate resilience and lower environmental risk — key benefits that buyers and regulators are beginning to demand as deforestation-related regulations and ESG expectations tighten.</p><p>Building on these outcomes, Belterra is piloting an approach to quantify, verify and value in monetary terms the ecosystem service benefits associated with its cacao production. These include carbon removal, soil-water retention and improvements in species diversity and habitat quality. Modeling suggests that these services add roughly $3,600 of “nature value” per ton of cacao beyond the commodity price. By embedding this verified nature value into outcome-linked offtake contracts, Belterra seeks to reward regenerative farming, attract outcome-based funders and offer buyers a traceable, climate-aligned supply of cacao that outperforms monoculture both ecologically and financially.</p><h4>Vale Base Metals</h4><p>Vale Base Metals (VBM) is exploring how putting nature on the balance sheet can reinforce its existing commitments under the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the International Council on Mining and Metals by treating natural capital as an intangible asset that safeguards the long-term viability of mining operations. VBN is exploring how investment into nature could represent reduced risks, avoided costs and new revenue opportunities, thereby strengthening enterprise value.</p><p>The company has piloted natural capital assessment at the Carajás mining complex in Brazil, mapping landscape changes between 1986 and 2023 to understand how conservation actions have preserved value. The Landbanking Group and VBM are undertaking modeling to assess the value created by different nature investment opportunities, for example, establishment of an ecological corridor, water-body restoration, agroforestry systems on degraded pasture and riparian-zone protection.</p><h4>Manulife Investment Management</h4><p>Manulife Investment Management is one of the world’s largest natural capital investment managers, with over $11.5 billion in timber assets across 5 million acres of timberland as of 2024. An early adopter of TNFD, Manulife has piloted natural capital accounting to demonstrate how nature contributes to long-term asset performance.</p><p>Manulife’s pilot focuses on linking ecosystem services directly to asset performance and valuation. For example, in the Neches watershed in Texas, Manulife manages riparian forests, wetlands and floodplain habitats where water-regulating services are valued at several million dollars annually. By enhancing these ecosystem assets — improving wetland health and forest resilience — the company aims to reduce wildfire, flood and drought risks; and open new revenue opportunities such as payments for ecosystem services. As markets begin to reward nature stewardship, assets demonstrating measurable natural capital value could attract price premiums and interest from investors seeking climate- and nature-aligned portfolios.</p><h3>Challenges and Opportunities for Scaling</h3><p>Momentum is building as early adopters rapidly advance the technical foundations for putting nature on the balance sheet. This frontier is now focusing on overcoming four key areas that hold back wider adoption:</p><ol><li>Creating clear pathways on how to integrate natural-capital valuation into concrete business and financial decisions.</li><li>Mobilizing and activating key stakeholders — accountants, auditors and boards — to embrace the opportunities, moving past initial risk aversion and providing clarity on disclosure and fiduciary duties.</li><li>Showcasing financial returns to clearly demonstrate how natural capital valuation can translate into direct financial returns in the market thanks to the development of high-visibility proof-of-concept projects.</li><li>Aligning regulations and incentives to create a policy environment for corporate action, including phasing out negative subsidies.</li></ol><p>This progress is amplified by significant advances in nature-data technologies, such as high-resolution remote sensing, automated monitoring and environmental DNA, which have significantly lowered the cost of measuring ecosystem extent, condition and services, opening new frontiers for accountability and scale. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the enabling conditions for mainstream uptake has also improved, with recent analyses highlighting the importance of consistent standards, credible governance and access to blended finance. Integrating nature into corporate accounts not only strengthens business risk management but also enables capital markets to reward nature-positive performance and penalize destructive practices, while revealing new opportunities for inclusive growth.</p><p>More evidence and real-world proof points are needed to build investor confidence and demonstrate how natural capital valuation creates tangible financial and resilience benefits. Strengthening and scaling pilot initiatives will be essential to generate this evidence base and move toward consistent adoption at scale – a challenge and opportunity that will be at the forefront of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, which some are referring to as the “Nature COP.” If these opportunities are seized, putting nature on the balance sheet can evolve from an experimental concept into a mainstream financial lever for resilience, competitiveness and systemic change.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>MEXICO CITY (November 11, 2025)</strong> – Mexico has officially approved and presented its new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) at COP30. The <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/semarnat/documentos/mensaje-de-la-secretaria-alicia-barcena-ibarra-al-presentar-la-ndc-3-0-de-mexico-en-la-sesion-plenaria-de-la-cumbre-climatica-de-lideres?state=published\">plan</a> marks a milestone in the country’s climate policy, introducing for the first time an absolute emissions cap for 2035 that covers all greenhouse gases and sectors of the economy.</p><p>Reinforcing its contribution to the Paris Agreement’s objectives, Mexico has committed to reducing emissions to 364–404 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) unconditionally, and to 332–363 MtCO2e with international support — a level the government estimates represents a reduction of more than 50% compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The NDC includes five interconnected components — mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, enabling conditions and means of implementation, and cross-cutting themes — that together outline a pathway for inclusive, low-carbon growth and resilient development.</p><p><em>See the </em><a href=\"https://es.wri.org/noticias/declaracion-mexico-anuncia-un-nuevo-y-firme-compromiso-climatico\"><em>Spanish version</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Below is a statement from Francisco Barnés Regueiro, Executive Director, World Resources Institute Mexico:</strong></p><p>“Mexico’s new climate plan stands among the most ambitious new climate targets from a major emitter, charting a path toward a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economy. It places people and nature at the heart of decision-making and reflects the government’s intent to align climate action with economic opportunity, jobs, social equity, and sustainable growth.</p><p>\"Mexico is aiming for deep emission cuts by 2035, in line with its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 – backed by an absolute target for greater transparency and accountability.</p><p>“On adaptation, the plan strengthens actions across five strategic areas, from climate-resilient production systems and integrated water management to the protection of strategic infrastructure and cultural heritage. New components on loss and damage, as well as on climate and security, reflect the government’s focus on managing the social and economic risks of the climate crisis.</p><p>“The NDC also embeds principles of gender equality, human rights, and intergenerational equity, ensuring that climate action addresses inequality, poverty, and vulnerability. It aims to deliver a just transition that creates decent jobs and broadens economic opportunity for women, Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, youth, and others historically left behind.</p><p>“Mexico’s ambition is clear, but delivering on these goals will require deep structural transformation and a clear, sustained investment strategy that positions climate action as a driver of inclusive and sustainable growth. Success will depend on clear sectoral pathways, robust financing mechanisms, and strong implementation plans once the full NDC is released. Aligning public budgets, financial instruments, and subnational policies with this new climate plan will be critical to unlocking innovation, boosting competitiveness, and creating good-quality jobs in low-carbon sectors.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>Today, WRI joined, as a partner, the Beat the Heat (Mutirão contra o Calor Extremo) initiative, a new effort launched at COP30 led by the COP30 Presidency and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)’s Cool Coalition.</p><p><a href=\"https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/beat-the-heat-in-cities/\">Beat the Heat</a> helps accelerate the implementation of local solutions to mitigate extreme heat, which contributes to more than 500,000 deaths a year. It also aims to advance sustainable cooling mechanisms through new technical assistance and financing pathways. The initiative invites countries, cities and regions to join a collective effort to turn UNEP’s <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-cooling-pledge\">Global Cooling Pledge</a> into meaningful local action and operationalize the EPIC Facility, the pledge’s key implementation mechanism.</p><p>WRI will serve as a core analytical and technical assistance partner for Beat the Heat, lending its urban analytics and capacity-building expertise to support local action. </p><p>Through this initiative, partners have committed to supporting cities in implementing solutions using a dual approach: enabling direct access to funding for on-the-ground implementation and providing technical assistance through a suite of technical partners. New commitments at COP30 bring the number of endorsers of Beat the Heat to <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/amid-rising-heat-sustainable-cooling-can-slash-emissions-and-save\">over 185 cities as well as 83 partner organizations</a>.</p><p>“Heat is the people’s agenda,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, WRI’s Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, at the Beat the Heat launch event in Belém. “Cities are key to protecting people against heat. We need better data so we can invest at speed and scale.”</p><h3>Building Knowledge and Capacity for Cooler Cities</h3><p>WRI’s partnership on Beat the Heat builds on its extensive experience working with cities on several initiatives that support urban heat mitigation.</p><p>One of these initiatives is the Cool Cities Lab, a data platform that enables detailed analysis of local heat risk and cooling solutions. Slated to launch in March 2026, the platform will allow cities to explore fine-grain metrics, identify the neighborhoods most vulnerable to rising temperatures, and tailor action plans to effectively reduce heat risks.</p><p>The Cool Cities Lab also enables cities to model the potential heat-reduction impact of a range of local solutions, from street trees to cool roofs and shade structures. By exploring the cooling potential of different interventions, individually or in combination, cities can develop data-informed intervention plans that deliver meaningful cooling benefits. </p><p>Through the Cool Cities Lab, WRI will provide data and analysis to cities participating in Beat the Heat.</p><p>Supporting this effort is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/data-cool-cities\">Data for Cool Cities</a>, through which WRI works with urban decision-makers to accelerate the adoption of cooling measures. This initiative equips cities with the data and tools needed to plan, fund, deploy and track solutions. Data for Cool Cities supports cities in three essential ways: by providing data to fill critical information gaps; building data analysis applications that create actionable insights; and scaling solutions through a global community of practice. To date, WRI has worked as a key technical support and implementation partner with more than 30 cities in 12 countries aiming to build their resilience to extreme heat.</p><p>Another initiative, the <a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/projetos/acelerador-solucoes-calor-urbano\">Urban Heat Solutions Accelerator</a>, provides capacity building on developing urban cooling projects currently being implemented to support five Brazilian cities. By focusing on building cities’ long-term capacity to develop heat-resilience projects and establishing reliable financing mechanisms to support implementation, the Accelerator offers the potential to produce lessons and best practices that can strengthen the global Beat the Heat initiative. </p><p>WRI and Drexel University’s Climate Change and Urban Health in Latin America Project (SALURBAL) are also conducting research on how heat, in combination with social factors and multiple aspects of the built environment, influences health-related impacts in neighborhoods in Belo Horizonte and Campinas, Brazil. Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/heat-and-health-brazilian-cities\">Heat and Health in Brazilian Cities</a> project, WRI is working with community members and policymakers in both cities to guide research and <span> </span>support the design and implementation of heat adaptation measures that safeguard health and promote equity. </p><h3>Speeding Up Action for Heat-Resilient Cities</h3><p>With climate change intensifying and increasingly threatening lives and livelihoods, now is the time for cities to take meaningful action on heat.

      "description": "<p><em>Launched by the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition and partners, the initiative will help companies scale clean energy solutions, decarbonize sectors and generate green jobs across the region.</em></p><p><strong>(Belém, BRASIL) November 11, 2025</strong> — At COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition – in partnership with Global Renewables Alliance (GRA), Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and Climate Group’s RE100 initiative – today launched the Latin America Clean Energy Coalition (LACEC), a major initiative to rapidly scale corporate clean energy adoption and accelerate Latin America's transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.</p><p>The coalition brings together leading companies, energy developers, financiers, civil society and policymakers to unlock investment, accelerate breakthrough solutions and advance policies that make clean energy more affordable, accessible and scalable across the region. Together, these efforts will help Latin America move closer to reaching its goal of tripling renewables by 2030. Nike is the founding member.  </p><p>“Latin America has all the ingredients to lead the global energy transition,” said <strong>Fernando Páez, Executive Director of WRI Colombia</strong>, “With over 60% of the region's electricity already from clean sources and more than 2 million renewable energy jobs created in 2023, the foundation is strong – but much more must be done. LACEC will mobilize the private sector to turn that potential into action – helping industries decarbonize, strengthen competitiveness, and spark new job growth.”</p><p>Despite this potential, the region faces persistent challenges that slow the adoption of clean energy. Current national plans and targets are projected to deliver only half of the annual growth in renewable power needed to stay on track. Key obstacles include an energy mix overly reliant on hydropower, weak grid infrastructure, and limited cross-border interconnections – gaps that LACEC aims to address.</p><p>“Latin America’s clean energy potential is immense, but realizing it takes more than ambition – it takes action,” said <strong>Trigya Singh, Senior Manager Corporate Sourcing, Global Renewables Alliance</strong>. “Through LACEC, we're helping energy buyers, sellers and policymakers involved in sourcing renewable energy, access renewable power more easily, clearing regulatory roadblocks, and sparking a wave of clean energy projects. These projects will help boost energy security, drive sustainable growth and transform Latin America.”</p><p>Building on the successful Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) model, which catalyzed corporate renewable energy adoption across Asian markets, LACEC will serve as Latin America's hub for clean energy leadership and knowledge exchange. The coalition will help companies design and implement robust renewable energy strategies, work with governments to drive enabling policies, and coordinate finance and investment to rapidly scale clean energy projects across industrial and manufacturing sectors.</p><p>“Success in Latin America's renewable energy transition won't come from technology alone – it needs effective collaboration and strong governance,” said <strong>María Teresa Ruiz-Tagle, Executive Director, Corporate Leaders Group for Climate Action – Chile (CLG Chile)</strong>. “The region needs a clear roadmap built on public-private-civil collaboration, with smarter storage, streamlined regulations and electrifying key sectors. We're convinced LACEC can help turn these priorities into real progress across Latin America.”</p><p>LACEC will launch its work in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, with plans to expand soon to Chile and Argentina. The coalition builds on WRI's deep regional presence and proven expertise in advancing evidence-based solutions for the global energy transition, together with the industry leadership of GRA, GWEC, and RE100.

      "description": "<p><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025)</strong> — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Brazil announced the Belém 4X Pledge on Sustainable Fuels, a commitment to quadruple production and use of ‘sustainable fuels’ by 2035, along with Japan, Italy, India and others. The fuels mentioned in the pledge include hydrogen, biogases, biofuels, and e-fuels.</p><p>The pledge cites a <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/delivering-sustainable-fuels\">new report</a> by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that envisions a quadrupling of these fuels by 2035, including a doubling of biofuel production.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Janet Ranganathan, Managing Director of Strategy, Learning and Results, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“While countries are right to transition away from fossil fuels, they also need to ensure their plans don’t trigger unintended consequences, such as more deforestation either at home or abroad. Doubling biofuel production would have significant implications for the world’s land, especially without guardrails to prevent large-scale expansion of land dedicated to biofuels, which drives ecosystem loss.  </p><p>“Already today, at least 40 million hectares of cropland are used globally to grow biofuel feedstocks, an area the size of Paraguay. And the world’s land is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore\">under pressure</a> to provide more food and wood products for a population that will grow toward 10 billion by 2050. At <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00429-z\">present rates of cropland expansion</a>, an area nearly the size of India would be converted from nature to food production between 2020 and 2050. Increasing biofuel mandates would create significant extra pressure for land conversion.</p><p>“WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/global-land-squeeze-managing-growing-competition-land\">global research</a> shows that expansion of land dedicated to biofuel production is likely to have serious negative impacts on food security, nature, and climate because it competes with food production or natural ecosystems. Biofuel production on agricultural land implies trade-offs with both food production and restoring land to nature. Agricultural products are commodities in global markets, and policies that increase demand for these products will raise prices and likely lead to expansion of new cropland. Both responses are likely to have negative impacts on climate, food security, and nature. Furthermore, many models and carbon accounting frameworks undercount biofuels’ land carbon cost or miss it entirely.</p><p>“That’s why both the land and the types of biomass used for fuels matter. The pledge says that efforts to scale up fuel use must be environmentally and socially responsible. But it does not include critical caveats from the IEA report: that biofuel expansion should not further increase cropland use, and that waste and residue-based biomass potentially offer a more sustainable pathway than feedstocks grown on dedicated land—although the amounts are limited, making scalability challenging. National policies should account for these important nuances.</p><p>“All countries should develop a strategy for how best to use their limited land to advance prosperity and meet people’s growing needs for food, while achieving climate and nature goals. These strategies should align with national pledges to halt deforestation and preserve existing ecosystems. Any mandates that intensify pressure on land risk undermining those commitments.</p><p>“More locally grounded research is needed to inform these strategies. For instance, how can Brazil best use its 40 to 100 million hectares of degraded land to meet its needs for food, wood products, jobs, revenue and energy, while protecting and restoring nature and meeting climate goals? As the demands on our land grow, while the planet’s land area stays the same, evidence-based land-use planning will be essential to balance competing priorities.”</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025)</strong> — The COP30 Leaders’ Summit concluded today with major announcements and pledges from world leaders, as well as political calls to action ahead of the formal negotiations beginning on November 10.</p><p>New initiatives and commitments included the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, a major finance mechanism to protect forests; pledges for Indigenous Peoples and local communities’ finance and land rights; a pledge to quadruple 'sustainable fuels'; a Call to Action on Wildfire Resilience; and the Belém Declaration on Hunger, Poverty and Human-Centered Climate Action.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“Leaders made the journey to Belém to show that investing in cleaner, more resilient economies isn’t just about the environment — it’s about long-term security and competitiveness. They showed they are transitioning their economies with green growth at the core, even as they recognized there’s still a long way to go.</p><p>“Nature was the star of the show, and rightly so in the heart of the Amazon. While we’ve made incredible progress on renewable energy and electric vehicles, leaders are now <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-launches-tropical-forests-forever-facility\">stressing that nature</a> must also be <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-nature-opportunities-2025\">central to the climate battle</a>. Their pledges showed that action is not just about protecting trees. It’s about building an economy around standing forests that supports the people who depend on them, making sure they have <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-countries-announce-pledges-support-indigenous-peoples-afro-descendants-and-local\">land rights and access to finance</a>.</p><p>“The energy transition also took the spotlight. Some countries pledged to transition away from fossil fuels toward ‘sustainable fuels,' but they must ensure the solutions they choose don’t trigger unintended consequences like more deforestation.</p><p>“Cities took center stage at the Local Leaders Forum in Rio, where more than <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.org/cop30-local-leaders-forum/a-message-from-local-leaders-to-cop30/\">14,000 cities, towns, states, regions and provinces</a> affirmed their commitment to advancing on-the-ground climate solutions. The local level is where ambition turns into action. Stronger <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-wri-bloomberg-philanthropies-and-partners-strengthen-city-and-state-climate-action\">partnerships between national and subnational governments</a> will be key to accelerating results.</p><p>“It’s no surprise that Brazil and emerging economies across the Global South are leading the charge to unite the climate, nature and people agendas — from launching the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-launches-tropical-forests-forever-facility\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> to advancing a declaration tackling hunger and poverty. These countries are showing that development and decarbonization go hand in hand.</p><p>“As countries now move toward official negotiations, the hard work begins. Many leaders have stepped up with new <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-un-report-finds-country-climate-commitments-falling-short\">national climate commitments to cut emissions</a>. But there remains a major gap between those plans and the critical benchmark of 1.5C — both in countries’ goals and the action to achieve them. COP30 in Belem needs to confront this gap head on.</p><p>“Governments need to reaffirm the 1.5C target, the benchmark for a livable, healthy planet, and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop30-progress-country-climate-plans\">agree to a roadmap</a> that drastically accelerates implementation. Countries should also spell out clear strategies to transition major sectors and support workers, including in energy, forests & agriculture, and transport —both for the next five years and for the long-term path to net zero.</p><p>“And finally, adaptation will be a major focus. Some developing countries are calling for a new goal to triple adaptation finance by 2030. This looks possible by 2035 but only if every source steps up — from development banks and bilateral aid to new concessional finance and scaled private investment — and the system works better as a whole.\"</p>",

      "description": "<p>Nations around the world are ushering in a new decade of climate action through revised <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs), due this year. The urgency for climate action has never been greater, especially with 2024 marking the warmest year on record globally. While the urban content of NDCs is improving, it remains insufficient and doesn't reflect the increasingly urban world we live in. UN-Habitat analysis showed that only <a href=\"https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2024/06/ndc_global_report_2023_v4_watermark.pdf\">27% of the last round of pledges</a> under the Paris Agreement included strong urban content.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP) for Climate Action</a>, launched at COP28, WRI has worked to advance the subnational content of new NDCs due this year, also known as \"NDCs 3.0.\" The CHAMP initiative is a pledge by 78 countries, to date, to include subnational governments in producing new NDCs as well as incorporate strong subnational content into these plans in order to progress, finance and deliver more ambitious and inclusive climate action overall.</p><p>Through CHAMP, WRI has provided technical assistance to four countries in particular during this latest round of NDC updates, with each demonstrating how cooperation is essential for ambitious climate action:</p><h3>Colombia</h3><p>In 2024, WRI Colombia and Colombia's Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/empowering-cities-to-shape-stronger-more-inclusive-ndcs-lessons-from-colombia/\">designed and launched a strategy to involve subnational governments</a> in the NDC update process and increase national and subnational climate ambition. In partnership with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, five regional workshops were hosted in five geographies: Medellín, Bogotá, Yopal, Cali and Barranquilla. The workshops were designed for a diverse set of subnational actors — including youth; women; and representatives from secretariats, local government, and Indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups — to create a more <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-subnational-governments-are-shaping-colombias-next-generation-climate-commitments/\">inclusive process for the country's updated NDC</a>.</p><p>This year, WRI Colombia and the country's Ministry of Housing hosted a workshop to identify implementation gaps for four measures in its NDC 2.0 that showed the least progress (two mitigation measures and two adaptation measures). During the workshop, key actions were prioritized to help overcome these barriers and define the next steps for 2026, 2028 and 2030.</p><p>In addition, WRI Colombia set up a Steering Committee with members from the Ministry of Housing, the National Planning Department and the Ministry of the Environment, as well as representatives from NGOs, multilateral development banks and subnational governments, to develop a shared understanding of urban challenges in the NDC 3.0 and how to address them.</p><p>On Sept. 25, Colombia submitted its <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/NDC%203.0%20Declarativa%20Colombia%20Transformaciones%20para%20la%20Vida%20V.25.09.2025%20Gob.%20Nacional.pdf\">\"declarative\" NDC 3.0</a>. This acknowledges the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-colombia-updates-its-climate-commitments-2035\">role of subnational governments</a> in planning and implementing climate mitigation and adaptation measures and promotes governance that integrates national and subnational perspectives.</p><h3>Rwanda</h3><p>In November 2024, WRI Africa, in close collaboration with the Rwandan Environment Management Authority (REMA) and the Ministry of Environment, organized a five-day, in-person workshop to surface district priorities for Rwanda's new NDC. The event brought together 130 participants representing all 30 of the country's districts — specifically, directors in charge of planning, agriculture and natural resources — to consolidate local and regional priorities and contribute to the national NDC enhancement process. The event was followed by a three-day, in-person validation workshop ensuring adequate capture of these priorities. Findings from the consultations were synthesized into a report and submitted to REMA to inform Rwanda's NDC 3.0.</p><p>Building on this foundation, in March 2025, WRI and ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability Africa supported REMA, the Ministry of Environment and the Rwandan Local Government Association to convene a policy dialogue with district vice mayors in charge of economic development. The dialogue aimed to strengthen political support for a whole-of-government approach to NDC implementation, fostering stronger coordination between national and subnational levels. WRI and partners also participated in a workshop with the Ministry of Environment and other key stakeholders to validate the draft NDC.</p><p>On Nov. 7, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-11/Rwanda%20NDC3.0.pdf\">Rwanda published its NDC 3.0</a>. This includes a higher mitigation target and a commitment to an economy-wide 53% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, relative to business as usual. The new NDC also emphasizes building capacity at the local level by investing in training and resources for districts, and calls for identifying and institutionalizing \"climate focal points\" in all 30 districts.</p><h3>Kenya</h3><p>WRI Africa, in partnership with the Financing Locally Led Climate Action (FLLoCA) program, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry (MECCF) and the Climate Change Directorate, organized a series of virtual meetings with climate change directors from all of Kenya's 47 counties. These consultations provided a platform to present Kenya's draft NDC 3.0 and gather feedback on how county-level climate priorities had been integrated into the national process.</p><p>In February 2025, WRI Kenya, in collaboration with C40 and the Global Covenant of Mayors, convened a CHAMP National Finance Accelerator Roundtable on the sidelines of the <a href=\"https://www.shiftcities.org/event/green-resilient-urbanshift-africa-forum-2025\">UrbanShift Forum</a> in Nairobi. This brought together key stakeholders to discuss opportunities for strengthening local access to climate finance and advancing multi-level collaboration on NDC implementation.</p><p>In May 2025, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-05/KENYAS%20SECOND%20NATIONALLY%20DETERMINED%20CONTRIBUTION%202031_2035.pdf\">Kenya submitted its NDC 3.0</a>, one of the earliest countries to do so.</p><p>On Oct. 28-29, WRI Kenya and the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate hosted a High-Level Convening to advance coordination, finance and implementation of Kenya's climate commitments under its new NDC. WRI Kenya, in collaboration with the Council of Governors (CoG), NDC Partnership (NDCP) and the Government of Kenya, will also convene two multistakeholder dialogues, focused on energy and transport and water and nature-based solutions, in November 2025.</p><h3>Ethiopia</h3><p>WRI Ethiopia held a high-level NDC 3.0 kickoff workshop in March 2025 in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and Development, sector ministries, NGOs, civil society organizations and the private sector. Following the workshop, WRI and the sector ministries also conducted a review of Ethiopia's NDC implementation to date. Building on this, WRI is further assessing implementation at the subnational level, with a case study focusing on Addis Ababa and a particular emphasis on the energy sector because of its relevance to the urban environment. WRI held an additional consultation workshop in early August to better understand how subnational elements of the new NDC might be implemented and produce practical suggestions for strengthening localization of the NDC.</p><p>Led by the Ministry of Planning and Development, and in consultation with the Ministry of Urban Development and Infrastructure and 30 local authorities, WRI also developed a greenhouse gas emissions estimation for Addis Ababa. The aim is to scale this to other cities, helping to emphasize the need for city-level investments in climate action.</p><p>In September 2025, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/Ethiopia%20NDC%203.0%20Final.pdf\">Ethiopia released its NDC 3.0</a>, which includes a 2035 mitigation target and revised, more ambitious mitigation, adaptation and financing targets in comparison to its last NDC. The new NDC commits to multilevel and multisectoral engagement and implementation to ensure broad ownership and alignment of climate action.</p><p><em>Editor's note: An update was made on Nov. 10, 2025 to reflect the release of Rwanda's NDC 3.0.</em></p>",

It requires at least 20% of the fund to go directly to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://forestclimateleaders.org/news-resources/governments-aim-to-collectively-recognise-160-million-hectares-of-indigenous-peoples-and-local-community-lands-in-tropical-forest-countr/\">Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment</a>, or ILTC, is a landmark commitment aimed at securing and legally recognizing 160 million hectares of land for Indigenous, Afro-descendants and local communities, and strengthening existing laws governing community land tenure. </li></ul><p>Together, these commitments signal a growing consensus that securing forest stewards’ land rights and access to finance is essential to safeguarding the planet’s climate and biodiversity.</p><h3>Why Land Rights and Finance Are Needed</h3><p>Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities steward <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fee.2148?ref=blog.aspiration.com\">more than one-third of the world’s intact forests and biodiversity areas</a> within their territories, and deforestation rates on these lands are <a href=\"https://rainforestfoundation.org/act-for-our-planet-before-its-too-late/\">up to 26%</a> lower than the global average. While <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">about 11%</a> of lands and forests globally are formally recognized as theirs, <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">at least 1.375 billion hectares</a> of their lands remain without legal recognition by national governments.</p><p>Without formal land rights, communities are often excluded from direct climate and forest financing. This happens because funds usually go to those who are legally registered as landowners, which is often the state rather than the forest communities themselves. From 2011 to 2024, <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/publication/state-of-funding-2025/\">less than 1%</a> of international climate financing reached programs that support Indigenous and community land tenure and management, and only a fraction of that went directly to community-led organizations. Of the $1.7 billion COP26 Forest Tenure Pledge, just over 10% <a href=\"https://landportal.org/library/resources/indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-forest-tenure-pledge-annual-report-2023\">reached Indigenous and community-led organizations</a> in 2023.</p><p>As a result, these communities often lack the resources needed to effectively protect forests from incursions, encroachments and land grabs, and to invest in land management practices that support global forest goals.</p><p>When the new COP30 finance commitments begin to flow, communities lacking formal land rights could again be left behind. Even proposals such as the TFFF, which allocates 20% of its funds for direct community access, may fall short if the funding delivery mechanism isn’t clearly defined.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A dust track with logs cut down on the side with a truck loaded with logs.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/logging-in-congo.jpg?VersionId=KP1q3usaQHEPv4IE6Z3Bv1FYr0Q.bKi5&itok=ZM2uz9dp\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Logging in Congo.

While these rights don’t grant full ownership, they can establish recognized forms of forest stewardship that can provide a foundation for communities to access financing and pave the way toward formal land titles.  </p><p>These forest tenure approaches typically include legitimacy vetting, geospatial mapping and recording in information registries, and documented conservation outcomes, which can serve as important building blocks to fulfill countries’ commitments under the ILTC and Pledge 2.0.</p><p>Here are several proven approaches to forest stewardship based on customary land tenure:</p><h4>Recognizing colonial-era or ancestral land grants </h4><p>Payments for ecosystem services, or PES, programs that pay landowners to maintain forest cover typically require formal land ownership. This often excludes many Indigenous and smallholder communities. But Guatemala’s PINPEP program (National Incentives Program for Small Landowners with a Forestry Vocation) provides a different approach: It allows <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-finance-access-indigenous-peoples-local-communities-payments-ecosystem-services\">participants to join the program</a> using verified colonial-era land grants and municipal certificates of possession in lieu of formal titles.</p><p>PINPEP recognizes verified customary possession and land use, allowing communities already protecting forests to access funds without undergoing the lengthy and costly process of getting formal land titles. The results are promising: An <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf602/pdf\">evaluation of Guatemala’s PES system</a> from 2007 to 2022 found a 3.4% drop in forest cover loss in Indigenous and smallholder forests under PINPEP, compared to a 1.6% increase in forest cover loss in forests under Guatemala’s PES program for titled landowners.</p><h4>Legal recognition of Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas   </h4><p>Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, or <a href=\"https://www.iccaregistry.org/en/about/iccas---territories-of-life\">ICCAs</a>, — also known as “Territories of Life” — are ecologically critical lands and waters governed and managed by Indigenous and rural communities based on their own customs, traditions and institutions. These lands recognize communities as collective stewards rather than private owners and provide a framework through which funding and conservation support can directly reach them.</p><p>These lands include sacred forests, community-managed forest areas, pastoral lands and coastal or marine regions that demonstrate positive conservation outcomes, even if conservation is not the primary objective. They are established by the communities themselves, based on deep historical and cultural connection to the area and their use of traditional land management systems. ICCAs are subject to peer review before being designated as such and recorded in the <a href=\"https://www.iccaregistry.org/en/about/icca-registry\">global ICCA Registry</a>.  </p><p>Many countries legally recognize ICCAs, and donors are increasingly supporting them. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/en/project/support-to-indigenous-peoples-and-community-conserved-areas-and-territories-iccas-13-iv-039-global-m-iccas-support/\">German International Climate Initiative</a>, or IKI, funded ICCA development in 45 countries, while <a href=\"https://wwfcastg.wwf.ca/media-releases/wwf-canada-announces-new-fund-for-indigenous-protected-and-conserved-areas/\">World Wildlife Fund-Canada</a> has established a fund to enable First Nations, Inuit and Métis Indigenous communities to create and manage their own protected areas.</p><h4>Recognizing long-term community forest management rights</h4><p>Many countries grant long-term forest management rights to state-owned forests. While forestland remains state property, communities gain exclusive rights to use, manage and protect it. This recognition allows them to participate directly in climate fund initiatives.</p><p>There are several examples of this in practice. Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/06/05/climate-action-game-changers-the-forest-story-from-indonesia\">social forestry program, or Perhutanan Sosial</a>, grants long-term permits of up to 35 years for local and customary communities to sustainably manage state forests. A <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/528/1/012037/pdf\">study spanning from 2007 to 2018</a> found that these areas saw a steady increase in primary forest and a decrease of secondary forest converted into non-forest areas. At the same time, local livelihoods and incomes rose by up to 92% in some regions.</p><p>Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the local community forest concessions program, or CFCL, <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/redd/news/detail/zh/c/1716893/\">grants customary communities</a> within or near national forest estates perpetual user rights to as much as 50,000 hectares of land. Since early 2024, more than 166 CFCLs have been granted, covering over 3 million hectares. A study found that CFCLs have up to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210107-congo-basin-a-bold-plan-to-save-africas-largest-rainforest\">23% lower deforestation rates</a> than the national average and 46% lower than logging concessions.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A man has his hands in the earth replanting a seedling.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/reforestation-in-indonesia_0.jpg?VersionId=DT1CIF.fDn_93xpua8KyOnOG_kXLS6E5&itok=Ke0x0NIR\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Community-led reforestation in Indonesia.

These and similar land-rights approaches offer a practical, high-impact pathway toward achieving the goals set under the new COP30 forest commitments.</p><p>The three forest commitments pledged during COP30 can be transformative, but only if they lead to action that puts land rights at the center. Ultimately, fully recognizing the rights of Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities to their lands is the only way to protect the world’s forests and our shared future.  </p><p>As COP30 sets the tone for the next phase of global climate action, securing land rights and unlocking finance for those who protect forests are two of the most strategic, effective and urgent investments the world can make.  </p><p> </p><p><em>This article was originally published on Oct. 21, 2025.

      "description": "<p><span><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 6, 2025)</strong> — </span>Today at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Brazil and a group of countries committed to a voluntary <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/documents\">Call to Action on Integrated Fire Management and Wildfire Resilience</a>. It includes a framework to boost wildfire resilience through science, policy and traditional and Indigenous knowledge. This Call to Action comes as fires drove record-breaking forest loss last year, according to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-global-forest-loss-shatters-records-2024-fueled-massive-fires\">Global Forest Watch analysis</a>.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement by Rod Taylor, Global Director for the Forest Program, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“We’re entering an alarming new era as fires became the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires\">leading cause of tropical primary forest loss</a> last year for the first time on record. This Call to Action signals that governments are waking up to the fact that preventing wildfires needs to be a top priority if they are to save the forests that underpin their economies.</p><p>“It's especially notable that civil society organizations from across the tropics and conservation groups have also <a href=\"https://www.tropenbos.org/tbi-cop30/\">signaled support for this Call to Action</a>.</p><p>“Climate-fueled conditions are driving more frequent and severe wildfires, which are often started by humans either to clear land for large-scale agriculture or as a traditional land management tool. From Brazil to Bolivia, fires surged across Latin America last year at a scale we haven’t seen in recent history.</p><p>“Governments should use this Call to Action to kickstart greater investments in fire prevention, early warning systems, and building resilient response approaches. Addressing wildfire risk needs to go hand-in-hand with slashing emissions that drive hotter and drier conditions.</p><p>“The framework’s commitment to involve Indigenous and local communities — among the world’s most <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">effective forest stewards</a> but <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/extreme-wildfires-growing-threat-and-call-support-indigenous-and-community-leadership\">disproportionately affected by wildfires</a> — in building fire management and prevention initiatives is all-important. To prevent catastrophic fires, effective fire management programs should support the use of traditional controlled burns and minimize farmers’ reliance on fires to manage land when wildfire risk is high.</p><p>“Plans like the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/financing-nature-conservation-tropical-forest-forever-facility\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> (TFFF) could provide even greater incentive for governments and businesses to invest in fire preventive strategies and improve forest communities’ livelihoods — as payments to countries hinge on them keeping forests standing.”</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 6, 2025)</strong> — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, countries announced three global commitments that recognize and support the role of Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities in protecting forests with increased finance and stronger land rights.</p><p>These <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-forest-pledges-must-center-forest-communities\">landmark pledges</a> include a renewed Forest and Land Tenure pledge for $1.8 billion in funding through 2030; the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment, co-led by Brazil, Norway and Peru, which aims to secure and formally recognize 160 million hectares of land for these communities; and the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), which includes a target requiring 20% of payments to go to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Wanjira Mathai, Managing Director for Africa and Global Partnerships, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“Together these initiatives demonstrate a massive and welcome shift in recognizing the central role that Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants, and local communities play in protecting the forests that sustain us all. These pledges represent both a matter of justice for these communities, survival for our forests, and necessity for our climate goals.</p><p>“Research shows that when communities have secure land rights, forests flourish. Deforestation rates on lands stewarded by Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00815-2\">up to 26% lower</a> than the global average. These communities steward more than <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-and-local-community-land-rights-protect-biodiversity\">54% of the world’s intact forest</a>, and their lands often hold higher biodiversity and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">store more carbon</a>.</p><p>“Yet today communities lack legal recognition for <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">over 1.3 billion hectares</a> of their traditional lands, limiting their access to capital and decision-making power. That’s why the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment is so critical, as it could catalyze political momentum in more countries to set national targets for recognizing land rights.</p><p>“Stronger land rights and more direct access to finance go hand in hand. Only around 10% of the <a href=\"https://landportal.org/library/resources/indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-forest-tenure-pledge-annual-report-2024\">prior $1.7 billion Forest Tenure Pledge</a> directly reached Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This renewed pledge must ensure more direct access to finance and spur a power shift — from projects designed for communities to solutions led and owned by them.</p><p>“These commitments could be transformative, but only if governments turn these words into action.”</p>",
