India is by far the world's biggest producer and exporter of mentha oil, fulfilling <a href=\"https://www.mcxindia.com/docs/default-source/products/agro-commodities/performance-review/performance-review-2023-24---mentha-oil.pdf\">around 80%</a> of global demand. The bulk (70%) of this comes from Uttar Pradesh.</p><p>Yet what was once a stable cash crop is faltering. India's mint farmers now face stiff competition from synthetic menthol, coupled with rising production costs and high taxes. These challenges are only exacerbated by climate change, which is making harvests less reliable.</p><p>They aren't alone: Farmers and businesses around the globe are grappling with climate risks and market disruptions. But India's mint industry is also exploring solutions across the supply chain — from trade reforms to more climate-resilient crop varieties — that can offer lessons for resilience in a changing world.</p><h3>Mint: The 'Green Gold' of India's Smallholder Farmers</h3><p>Mentha farming has been a staple in Uttar Pradesh for over 40 years, particularly in the state's Barabanki region. Once a hub for opium cultivation, Barabanki leaned into mint farming in the 1980s and has been India's biggest producer since. Around the area, mint oil has earned monikers like \"ATM\" and \"green gold.\"</p><article class=\"align-left media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"717\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"500\" />\n              <source height=\"717\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"500\" />\n              <source height=\"652\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"652\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"652\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Map of India showing the locations of Uttar Pradesh and Barabanki.\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/uttar-pradesh-barabanki-map-wri_0.png?VersionId=MmgvEQxB6RQsyq1MLR3Llci2CCt0I.HR&itok=R644niNm\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>\"Mentha provides instant cash,\" says Dr. Sanjay Singh, Senior Principal Scientist at Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), a government-run research institute in Uttar Pradesh. \"There are times when farmers don't even have enough money to buy essentials. That is when a mentha farmer would sell half a kilogram of [mentha] oil from his reserve.\"</p><p>Saroj Kumari Shukla, a resident of Barabanki district, is one such farmer. She lost her husband after 15 years of marriage and had to raise her six children alone. \"I had a job, but it was not enough. Mentha came to our rescue in those days. Every time I had to pay the children's school fees, I would sell two kilograms of [mentha] oil,\" she said. \"Even though my sons couldn't study much, today my four daughters are well-educated and working.\"</p><p>For Chauhan, mint has been a dependable source of cashflow. \"Mentha brings an income in the season when no other crop grows. Its seed material, unlike chili and garlic, is also very affordable. It can be stored for [a long time] as it does not become rancid and doesn't even occupy space like other [produce].\"</p><article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://youtu.be/1o0xN4OXIkE\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch Mint: The 'Green Gold' of India's Smallholder Farmers\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Demand Is Rising — but Production Is Falling</h3><p>The global mint market <a href=\"https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-mint-market\">is projected to grow</a> from US$ 7.7 billion in 2025 to US$9.7 billion in 2030. In theory, this should be a boon not just for mint farmers, but for all those whose livelihoods are linked to the crop — from planting and harvesting to processing and exporting. \"One million people are involved in the mint supply chain in India, with 100,000 farm families and 3,000-4,000 traders just in Barabanki,\" said Dr. Singh.</p><p>But even as farmers like Chauhan and Shukla are earning well from mint, many say its glory is fading.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two images.

This year, many have shifted to sugarcane and other crops,\" he said.</p><div class=\"callout mint-callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link mint-callout-heading\"><strong>How Is Mint Oil Produced?</strong></p><p>In Uttar Pradesh, farming for mentha suckers (offshoots that grow from the base of the mint plant) begins in July-August. The crop is sown from suckers in March and harvested from May to June, fitting well between the seasons for potato and paddy, the other dominant crops in the region. Once the harvest is dried, its essential oil is extracted in locally fabricated steam distillation units owned and operated by individual farmers or farmer collectives.</p><p>Farmers sell this mentha oil to aggregators in the village who further sell it to traders, exporters and small-scale and medium industries. The oil is either exported as-is or processed into menthol crystals and byproducts like Dementholized oil (DMO), alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and menthone.</p></div><h3>What's Ailing the Mint Industry?</h3><p>Traders, industrialists, scientists and farmers largely blame synthetic menthol for downturn in Barabanki's mint production.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-right half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"571\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"451\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Clear crystals made from distilled mint oil.\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/mentha-crystals_0.jpg?VersionId=SIBnWsNkcXM5VJ3cO1HMHFS6e9IxsvOP&itok=GPpeMwFv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Menthol crystals derived from mentha oil. Photo by Ravleen Kaur</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Prices for natural mint oil can be volatile. When synthetic menthol — derived from <a href=\"https://www.betalabservices.com/natural-vs-synthetic-menthol/\">Meta-cresol, a petrochemical</a> — entered India around 2013, it offered an affordable alternative. \"Since then, many Indian companies making menthol-based products shifted to it\" said Tek Ram Sharma, a mint oil trader and chairman of essential oil company Ashri Naturals.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also included synthetic menthol in its list of substances <a href=\"https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/menthol/\">\"generally recognized as safe\"</a>. \"Since synthetic menthol is approved for use in edible products, companies would not want to spend more on natural menthol,\" said Mittal. This has pushed prices down and driven some farmers to abandon natural mentha altogether.</p><p>Synthetics aren't the only challenge. Mint faces high taxes in India. The national government charges a Goods and Services Tax of 12% on mint oil, and Uttar Pradesh charges a 1.5% Mandi tax (a tax on agricultural produce sold in markets) to mint oil traders.</p><p>In addition, many farmers rely on locally fabricated steam distillation units for producing mint oil. These are inefficient, polluting and prone to <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/mentha-boiling-tank-explosion-in-uttar-pradeshs-barabanki-claims-2-lives/711314/%22HYPERLINK%20%22https:/www.financialexpress.com/india-news/mentha-boiling-tank-explosion-in-uttar-pradeshs-barabanki-claims-2-lives/711314/%22%22HYPERLINK%20%22https:/www.financialexpress.com/india-news/mentha-boiling-tank-explosion-in-uttar-pradeshs-barabanki-claims-2-lives/711314/%22%22HYPERLINK%20%22https:/www.financialexpress.com/india-news/mentha-boiling-tank-explosion-in-uttar-pradeshs-barabanki-claims-2-lives/711314/%22\">fatal accidents</a>.

But they also face twin threats farmers around the world are increasingly grappling with: climate change and land degradation.</p><p>Mint is grown in peak summer and requires substantial irrigation. According to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sA41Ke2kor3E-tHWf7xet5GGZPSYq9pS/view?usp=sharing\">one study</a>, even when used optimally, around 10 million liters of water are required to irrigate 1 hectare (ha) of mint. By <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318430403_Crop_Water_Requirement_Water_Productivity_and_Comparative_Advantage_of_Crop_Production_in_Different_Regions_of_Uttar_Pradesh_India\">comparison</a>, it takes about 7 million liters of water to irrigate 1 ha of wheat and 5 million liters to irrigate 1 ha of maize (corn). \"As water scarcity increases, farmers in Sambal, Chanduasi and Amroha [districts in Uttar Pradesh] and in parts of Punjab and Bihar are quitting mentha,\" said Sharma.</p><p>Unlike these other regions, Barabanki has ample water thanks to its rivers and extensive canal network. But shifting weather patterns driven by climate change present their own problems.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-left half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1021\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"806\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"611\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"611\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"611\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A farmer sitting in front of his field of mint crops.\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/narendra-shukla1_0.jpeg?VersionId=c_1fiEWwPW69MWrfJNdn8I4H9AEvGjXU&itok=nXFEm1i_\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Narendra Shukla, a farmer from Tandpur in Uttar Pradesh, has seen the region's escalating challenges firsthand.

After 20 years of mint farming, soil is also polluted with chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Production has gone down while diseases have increased. We need to spray pesticides at least once a week now,\" said Sanad Verma, another farmer in the region.</p><p>Verma adds that labor rates have more than tripled — from Rs 200 (US$2.32) to Rs 700 (US$8) per day — \"because harvesting mentha and extracting oil in peak summer is a gruelling task.\"</p><p>While organic farming may help improve soil quality and yields in the long term, it is out of question for most mint farmers, who don't see monetary benefits in it. \"A small farmer needs money all the time. Nobody will pay a better price for organic oil, so there is no reason to spend extra time and labour to cultivate organic mint,\" said Ram Savle Shukla of Tandpur.</p><h3>How India's Mint Industry Is Building Resilience</h3><p>Faced with mounting challenges — some local, some global — India's mint industry is finding new ways to adapt throughout the supply chain.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Lessons for Supply Chains Around the World</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Farmers and small businesses are often on the front lines of the climate crisis. Yet large companies tend to overlook these supply chain partners in their climate risk assessments and sustainability efforts. WRI, through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-resilient-supply-chains-crest\">Climate-Resilient Employees for a Sustainable Tomorrow</a> (CREST) initiative, aims to create more resilient supply chains and help amplify the voices of the people within them. The Barabanki mint farmer is one of these voices. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-resilient-supply-chains-crest/voices-supply-chains\">Explore more stories here</a>.</p></div><p>At one end, traders and local politicians are pushing to reform taxes and trade policies that hamper the natural mint industry. In <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsPotliEng/status/1819297177027653797\">August 2024</a>, a political representative from Barabanki worked with the Indian Parliament to separate natural and synthetic menthol in the country's trade code. This is meant to help ensure that potential issues with synthetics (such as defective products) will not impact the natural mint market.</p><p>Others are working from the ground up, helping farmers build resilience to climate and market shocks.</p><p>\"Mint is CIMAP's baby. It took hard work to turn India from a mint importing country to the biggest exporter in the world. So we will do everything to sustain natural menthol in the market,\" said Dr. Singh from CIMAP.</p><p>In 2017, CIMAP introduced early mint technology (EMT). This involves training farmers to produce mint stolons (stems) in a nursery and then transplant them onto ridges to ensure minimal plant loss and damage. EMT can lower the cost of production by reducing the need for weeding, irrigation and fertilizer. By cutting water use 25%-30%, it also helps reduce pressure on limited supplies. \"We found that the cost of cultivation with EMT has come down by 20% while crop yield has gone up by 15%,\" said Dr. Singh.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Small plot of mint plants.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/cimap-fields-1_0.jpg?VersionId=_.NAuegx0d7XU1gkd.GmmeMxwGBqj6dN&h=d1cb525d&itok=F_ro7hIf\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Experimental mint varieties developed by CIMAP have shown improved climate resilience and higher yields. Photo by Ravleen Kaur</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>CIMAP is also working to develop more resilient and productive mint varieties. In 2020, it developed and distributed \"CIM-Unnati\" — a hardy and high-yielding varietal that can better withstand extreme weather while yielding 180-190 kilograms of mint oil per hectare. (Other varietals produce 120-150 litres per hectare.) Almost 90% farmers in Barabanki now grow CIM-Unnati.</p><p>Chauhan — who runs a YouTube channel called \"Mentha's new variety\" — can attest to the benefits. \"In 2020, I got 700 grams of a new variety of Menthol mint from CIMAP and made 1,000 saplings out of it. I propagated these saplings [on 0.25 hectares] of my land and got a profit of Rs 1.5 lakh (US$1,740) by selling mint suckers,\" he said. Encouraged, Chauhan started the YouTube channel to promote his enterprise. \"Farmers from far and wide come to buy mentha suckers from me.

It supports activities like vermi compost production from distillation waste; mushroom cultivation; and beekeeping. \"We are also exploring making disposable cutlery from mentha waste and aerosols from the water that comes out with oil at the time of distillation,\" said Dr. Singh. This is helping to diversify mint farmers income, boost their resilience and reduce dependency on one crop.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1183\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"946\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"725\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"571\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Woman holding a beeswax candle.\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/savitri-devi-beeswax-candl.jpeg?VersionId=nLD8JC3tjIJqoVZBgizLf.Mx8OyRTSpF&itok=6m7BquWM\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Savitri Devi, seen here holding a beeswax candle, is a member of the farmer group that CIMAP is supporting to help diversify their incomes.

And they are more securely positioned when climate extremes and other setbacks strike.</p><h3>The Way Ahead</h3><p>While large companies are increasingly focused on climate risks and sustainability, supply chain partners, such as smallholder farmers, tend to be left out of the equation. But this status quo can't continue. For truly resilient supply chains, stakeholders need to work together to ensure that everyone involved — from production through to sale — has the tools, skills and knowledge to weather climate and economic shocks.</p><p>This will require coordinated efforts from governments, research institutions and the private sector. Barabanki shows how collaboration and innovation can make a difference, with CIMAP supporting farmers directly while traders and local politicians push for market reforms. Looking ahead, more support from the government could offer new avenues for investment and improvement. For example, as Dr. Sudeep Tandon, CIMAP's Chief Scientist, points out, \"Menthol is one crop in which farmers themselves do the first level of processing. The government gives subsidies for other agricultural equipment and machinery; why can't there be a price support mechanism for menthol distillation units too?\"</p><p>Such efforts are critical for all who depend on India's mint supply chain. \"Mentha has prevented distress migration in [Barabanki] to a large extent,\" says farmer Ram Lagan Pal. \"[The] district's prosperity is only due to mentha.\" More support for resilience-building efforts can help ensure that this prosperity continues.</p><p><em>Ravleen Kaur is an independent journalist working on environmental and rural issues in India.

      "description": "<p><strong>BONN, GERMANY (June 26, 2025)</strong> — The 2025 UN climate talks concluded today in Bonn after a challenging start, with a two-day delay over the agenda cutting into negotiation time. As a mid-year checkpoint before COP30, the largely technical talks aimed to bring countries closer on core issues including adaptation, mitigation and finance. While some progress emerged, political tensions slowed momentum. <br /> <br /><strong>Following is a statement from David Waskow, Director, International Climate Initiative, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“With four months to go before COP30, leaders need to start delivering: they need to put forward strong national plans to cut emissions and transform key sectors; scale up climate finance from all sources; and urgently implement and mainstream adaptation and resilience to protect lives, economies, and security. With the 1.5°C window closing fast, every fraction of a degree — and every decision — matters.</p><p>“Persistent political tensions and competing agendas led to limited and uneven progress in Bonn. Delegates did lay essential groundwork for better measuring adaptation — a key part for planning and accountability – and made some headway on just transition issues. What’s now needed is a strong dose of decisive, coordinated action to deliver real results.</p><p>“There can be no further delays in achieving the Global Stocktake priorities set in 2023 - from transitioning away from fossil fuels to tripling renewables, doubling energy efficiency and ending deforestation. Moving forward requires bold, system-wide change across every sector, driven by all levels of government, business, and civil society, recommitting to the Paris Agreement — together.”</p><p> </p>",

Electric buses include <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-all-electric-cars-work\">battery electric buses</a>, <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-basics-phev\">plug-in hybrid electric buses</a> and <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/fuel-cell\">fuel cell electric buses</a>. So far, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">94%</a> of all electric buses are battery electric, which are expected to continue to dominate the industry.</p><p>More than <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">90%</a> of the world’s electric buses are located in China — nearly 700,000 in total. China experienced massive growth in electric buses from 2014 to 2018, a time when other countries had barely started deploying them. In 2017, Shenzhen became the first city in the world to electrify its entire bus fleet (16,000 buses). By 2023, the top 10 global <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/r2z-zero-emission-hdv-china-2023-aug24/\">cities with the most electric bus sales</a> were in China, with Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing leading the way. Outside of China, <a href=\"https://ebusradar.org/en/\">Santiago, Chile</a> is the city with the highest electric bus sales.</p><p>The European Union is home to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">17,000</a> electric buses, with most of the sales growth taking place after 2018. Several European countries such as the Netherlands, Finland and Switzerland have achieved very high rates of electric bus adoption.</p><p>India, South Korea and the United States are <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">each home</a> to more than 10,000 electric buses.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\"><noscript><img alt=\"hierarchy visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23674775/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>China: The Primary Electric Bus Player</h3><p>China started deploying electric buses more than a decade ago, becoming the leading electric bus manufacturer and market in the world.</p><p>At first, the government supported electric buses as a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">strategic industry</a>. China saw a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">competitive advantage</a> in pursuing EVs in an already saturated fossil-fuel-vehicle-manufacturing market. City buses were a good candidate for early electrification because they were a public purchase and had fixed routes with a range — on average 120 miles per day — that could operate on a single charge.</p><p>After years of unhealthy smog in China’s most high-profile cities, the desire to reduce air pollution and improve health also became a motivator. The central government began <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">evaluating local officials’</a> performances based on their progress in reducing air pollution, which created an incentive for those officials to electrify transportation. </p><p>In 2009, China began an EV subsidy program in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856422002312\">10 pilot cities</a>. Over time the program added 88 more cities. It was eventually replaced with a national EV subsidy program. The government also put in place favorable polices that <a href=\"https://zfxxgk.ndrc.gov.cn/web/iteminfo.jsp?id=19564\">lowered electricity prices</a> for charging electric buses and <a href=\"https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2015-05/22/content_2866789.htm\">gradually removed</a> its existing subsidies for diesel buses.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23676592/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Cities in China also designed their own policies to make electric buses financially viable. For example, Shenzhen provided city-level subsidies in addition to the national subsidies, which made it <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/db408b53-276c-47d6-8b05-52e53b1208e1/e-bus-case-study-Shenzhen.pdf\">36% cheaper</a> to own an electric bus than a diesel bus over its lifetime. In some cases, the city <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/db408b53-276c-47d6-8b05-52e53b1208e1/e-bus-case-study-Shenzhen.pdf\">leased</a> the buses rather than buying them outright to spread out the costs over the leasing period. </p><p>Many cities also developed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">creative strategies</a> to optimize charging and designed operations schedules to compensate for the electric buses’ shorter ranges and recharging needs. In a few examples, charging infrastructures were built that could be <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/how-did-shenzhen-china-build-worlds-largest-electric-bus-fleet\">shared</a> with electric cars. As Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu, Beijing and many other Chinese cities became <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856422002312\">electric bus leaders</a> and the industry matured, the government gradually <a href=\"https://theicct.org/subsidy-fraud-leads-to-reforms-for-chinas-ev-market/\">scaled down the subsidies</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/ze-mhdv-market-china-january-june-2024-nov24/\">Nearly 100%</a> of city buses sold in China are now electric, an impressive accomplishment, but <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/mainland-chinas-bus-production-in-the-shadow-of-covid19.html\">about half of its bus market</a> is privately-owned coach buses — used for tourism, business and intercity travel. <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/ze-mhdv-market-china-january-june-2024-nov24/\">Only 6%</a> of coach bus sales are electric. Coach buses travel longer distances, where the limited range and long charging times of electric buses can become more challenging. When looking at city and private buses together, since 2017 electric bus sales have <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">plateaued</a> at a little over half of all China’s bus sales.</p><p>For almost a decade, China’s total bus market has been <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/mainland-chinas-bus-production-in-the-shadow-of-covid19.html\">shrinking</a>. Fewer new buses may be needed because so many were deployed in a short amount of time. Also, car ownership has <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/285306/number-of-car-owners-in-china/\">increased rapidly</a> and China now has the world’s most extensive <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-high-speed-rail-cmd/index.html\">high-speed train network</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic also had an impact — urban bus ridership still <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/258560/passenger-trasportation-china-by-public-transport-type/\">has not recovered</a> to pre-2020 levels, and the economic impacts may have decreased city budgets.</p><p>Chinese electric bus companies, however, continue to show they’re a dominant force in the industry. The <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/r2z-zero-emission-hdv-china-2023-aug24/\">top 10 electric bus companies</a> worldwide are all Chinese and China’s <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a9e3544b-0b12-4e15-b407-65f5c8ce1b5f/GlobalEVOutlook2024.pdf\">exports</a> account for 30% of the electric buses sold in Europe and more than 85% of the electric buses in Latin America.</p><h3>The Netherlands: An Early Leader in Europe</h3><p>The Netherlands invested heavily in electric buses earlier than any other European country and now has more than 2,100 electric buses on the road.</p><p>In 2016, Dutch transit authorities <a href=\"https://www.interregeurope.eu/good-practices/national-administrative-agreement-zero-emission-buses-bazeb-in-2016-in-the-netherlands\">set</a> the most ambitious target in the world for all new bus sales to be zero-emissions by 2025, with the entire fleet to follow by 2030. The move, which was created as part of <a href=\"https://www.rvo.nl/files/file/2019/06/Misson%20Zero%20Powered%20by%20Holland.pdf\">the Netherlands’ national climate plan</a> to decarbonize transportation, triggered a rapid shift toward electric buses nationwide.</p><p>To facilitate the transition, public transit authorities gave <a href=\"https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bart-kraaijvanger-public-transport-zero-emissions/\">longer contracts</a> to the private electric bus companies that own and operate public transit buses in the Netherlands to help them recoup their investments (15 years instead of 8 to 10 years for diesel). Various cities and regions also provided financial support for the transition. For example, Amsterdam gave direct <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/policies/7222-amsterdam-city-subsidies-for-electric-commercial-vehicles\">subsidies</a> of up to 40,000 euros per bus (about $45,000 based on average 2019 and 2020 exchange rates <span>— </span>when the subsidies began implementation).</p><p>The country also used dynamic <a href=\"https://brainporteindhoven.com/en/business-and-innovation/cases/the-largest-electric-bus-fleet-in-europe-operates-in-brabant\">modeling</a> to plan bus schedules and routes. In some cases, it also used <a href=\"https://www.heliox-energy.com/case-studies/the-worlds-largest-opportunity-depot-charge-network\">opportunity charging systems</a> that allowed for fast charging of the batteries during stops along the route.</p><p>After reaching more than 60% of bus sales, electric buses in the Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">fell</a> in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic caused financial constraints and supply chain bottlenecks, so many electric bus purchases were <a href=\"https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bart-kraaijvanger-public-transport-zero-emissions/\">postponed</a>. Today, the electric bus transition is <a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/ondermaatse-accu-s-kapotte-laadpalen-oude-dieselvloot-neemt-duurzame-elektrische-bussen-weer-over/64387845.html\">still struggling</a> due to overloaded electric grids and technical problems with charging. While the Netherlands has made impressive progress, it is in danger of missing its ambitious targets without making big investments in electric buses and supportive infrastructure.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23790084/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The rest of the European Union has also been <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">adding</a> electric buses to its fleets. Electric buses increased from less than 2% of EU bus sales in 2018 to 19% in 2024. An important turning point came in 2019, when the EU adopted a <a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/clean-transport/clean-and-energy-efficient-vehicles/clean-vehicles-directive_en\">Clean Vehicles Directive</a> which <a href=\"https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/zero-emission-buses-europe-sept22.pdf\">set binding requirements</a> for publicly-procured buses to be clean, with escalating targets as time goes on. Then in 2024, the EU <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-29-2024-INIT/en/pdf\">released</a> a target for a 90% reduction in city bus carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and a 43% reduction in coach and intercity bus emissions.</p><p>About 70% of the EU’s buses are manufactured by European companies, including MAN and Mercedes-Benz from Germany and Solaris from Poland. Chinese companies <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a9e3544b-0b12-4e15-b407-65f5c8ce1b5f/GlobalEVOutlook2024.pdf\">grew</a> from 10% of the EU market for electric buses in 2017 to 30% in 2023.</p><h3>Chile: Home to the Leading City for Electric Buses Outside of China</h3><p>Chile has <a href=\"https://ebusradar.org/en/\">more than 2,700</a> electric buses in operation as of April 2025, the most of any country in Latin America, with <a href=\"https://ebusradar.org/en/#cities\">about 2,500</a> in its capital city. Santiago now has the <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/From-Pilots-to-Scale-Lessons-from-Electric-Bus-Deployments-in-Santiago-de-Chile?language=en_US\">largest fleet</a> of electric buses of any non-Chinese city, making up <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/en/news/chile-is-now-home-to-the-second-largest-electric-bus-fleet-in-the-world/\">more than a third</a> of its total fleet.</p><p>In 2017, Chile established a <a href=\"https://www.minenergia.cl/archivos_bajar/2018/electromovilidad/estrategia_electromovilidad-27dic.pdf\">national electromobility strategy</a> and in 2021, it announced a <a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/how-santiago-became-one-of-the-first-cities-to-electrify-public-transport-at-scale\">goal</a> of 100% bus electrification by 2035. By 2023, <a href=\"https://www.anac.cl/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Informe-Cero-y-Bajas-Emisiones-Dic23-DatosV2.pdf\">46%</a> of the buses sold in Chile were electric.</p><p>The push to clean up buses in Santiago — one of Latin America’s largest cities and home to 40% of Chile’s population — began out of a desire to reduce air pollution and reduce health impacts; the city was <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/From-Pilots-to-Scale-Lessons-from-Electric-Bus-Deployments-in-Santiago-de-Chile?language=en_US\">one of the most polluted</a> in Latin America in the 1990s.

For motorized vehicles, this means electrifying not only buses but also <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/countries-adopting-electric-vehicles-fastest\">passenger cars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2023/trends-in-electric-heavy-duty-vehicles\">heavy trucks</a>, while ensuring the electricity comes from <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/power/rapidly-scale-zero-carbon-electricity-generation\">increasingly clean sources</a>.</p><p>While buses are not the biggest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, the transition to electric buses can lead to reduced climate change, healthier air, happier riders, less congestion and improved access to jobs and services for lower-income groups. Electric buses can also serve as a test case for other high-emitting vehicle types like <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/transport/transition-zero-carbon-cars-trucks-and-buses?indicatorId=2258&tab=timeline\">heavy trucks</a>.</p><p>Leading countries like China, the Netherlands, Chile and India prove that a rapid transition to electric buses is possible and desirable.</p><p><em>Data for electric bus sales, sales share and fleet size in this article are from the </em><a href=\"http://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\"><em>International Energy Agency's Global EV Data Explorer</em></a><em>, as of April 2025.

      "description": "<p>Protecting and restoring forests <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/\">are essential</a> for curbing climate change. But while efforts often focus on conserving mature forests and planting new trees (both of which are badly needed), a critical piece of the puzzle is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01026-8\">often overlooked</a>: managing naturally regrowing forests to increase the carbon they remove.</p><p>Until now, scientists did not have a detailed picture of the carbon removal value of naturally regrowing forests. But <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02355-5\">new research</a> by The Nature Conservancy, WRI and partners shows that naturally regenerating \"secondary forests\" (which have regrown after being cleared by harvests, severe fires, agriculture or other disturbances) could be especially powerful for fighting climate change. It is the first to show where, and at what ages, they can have the biggest impact.</p><p><strong>We found that secondary forests between 20 and 40 years old can remove carbon from the atmosphere up to 8 times faster per hectare than new natural growth —</strong><em><strong> if</strong></em><strong> they're allowed to reach those older ages. </strong>The catch is that many secondary forests don't regrow for this long, whether due to human activity (such as clearing or harvest) or climate-related disturbances (like fires or pests).</p><p>These findings highlight that countries may be underestimating the value of naturally regenerating secondary forests in their climate reporting — and that protecting them, or encouraging their regrowth for longer periods, offers untapped opportunities for climate action.</p><h3>How Quickly Can Secondary Forests Remove Carbon?</h3><p>The rate at which natural forests remove carbon from the atmosphere varies with location and age. Within a forest's first 100 years of regrowth after being cleared or destroyed — the age range covered in this research — carbon removal rates generally start relatively slow, then accelerate, before slowing again. That means it may take many years before newly established forests provide their largest climate benefits.</p><p>Our new research provides the first global maps of how these carbon removal rates vary across space and time as secondary forests regenerate naturally. The maps cover any square kilometer on Earth where forests could grow. Previous estimates have not captured as much <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/vol4.html\">geographic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2686-x\">age</a> variation or did not provide <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36922608/\">global</a> coverage.</p><p>We found that naturally regenerating forests typically remove carbon fastest when they're between 20 and 40 years old. This means that older secondary forests can provide more immediate and often greater carbon removals than younger regrowing forests.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22205308/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>However, the age at which forests reach their peak carbon removal rates varies across the globe. Tropical and subtropical rainforests (such as the Amazon and the Congo Basin) and some temperate forests (such as in in the United States) capture carbon fastest at younger ages. Meanwhile, boreal forests (like in Canada and Russia), Mediterranean forests, and forested areas in tropical and subtropical savanna regions (such as the Brazilian Cerrado), reach their maximum — and generally lower — carbon removal rates at older ages.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21926583/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Maximum carbon removal rates also vary vastly by region. On average, established secondary forests at their peak removal age absorb 10% more carbon than newly growing forests. But in some areas, the difference is as large as 820%.</p><p>Carbon removal rates change most dramatically with age in tropical and subtropical wet forests, while changes were least pronounced in Mediterranean forests and woodlands. However, there is variation within each of these ecoregions, highlighting the value of knowing how carbon removal changes through time for every square kilometer of potential forest.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21926921/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Data</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">To better understand carbon removal by naturally regenerating forests, we developed a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02355-5\">global machine learning model</a> that maps carbon removal rates across naturally regenerating forests up to 100 years old. The model combines over 100,000 field plot measurements of carbon stocks at different forest ages for 66 environmental covariates and predicts carbon stocks at 1 kilometer resolution every 5 years as forests age. Then, from the carbon stock maps, we derived carbon accumulation curves. The resulting maps show how much carbon could be removed by allowing forests to regenerate without major disturbances for any forest age and any location where forests naturally occur. (Note that these maps predict what would happen if regeneration does occur, but do not show where natural regeneration could or should occur.)</p></div><h3>Many Secondary Forests Never Reach Peak Carbon Removal Age</h3><p>Knowing when forests remove the most carbon matters. The world urgently needs to scale up climate action over the next 25 years (2025-2050) to achieve net-zero emissions deadlines and protect the planet from the worst effects of climate change. This new data shows that older secondary forests are some of the most effective at removing carbon within this critical window. And it pinpoints when and where regrowing forests pack the biggest climate punch.</p><p>Yet despite their importance, naturally regrowing secondary forests are frequently ignored in climate policy — and they are under threat. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02721-8\">Across the tropics</a>, forests regenerate for an average of 7.5 years before being cut down, with only 6% reaching 20 years of regrowth. In the Brazilian Amazon, <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab76db\">half of secondary forests</a> are cleared within eight years. In Costa Rica, where the clearance cycle is one of the longest in the tropics, the average age for regenerating forest is still only <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12607\">20 years</a>.</p><p>This means that many secondary forests never reach their peak carbon removal years, undercutting their climate benefits as well as the benefits they bring to people and nature. In addition to faster carbon removals, allowing forests to regrow naturally — as opposed to more active planting — can <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-assisted-natural-regeneration-benefits-definition\">provide benefits</a> like restoring biodiversity and protecting waterbodies at much lower costs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A fire burning in the Amazon Rainforest.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-04/brazil-amazon-fire-deforestation-agriculture-jpg.jpg?VersionId=7gZzhtccKvhimLqWCovXMyQ6fi301JP7&itok=7C1RKToF\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Fire is used to clear an area in the Brazilian Amazon for agricultural use.

This new information provides valuable insights into how to prioritize forest management efforts to maximize their impact:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Secondary forests should be protected or kept growing for longer periods. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Currently, secondary forests are often not prioritized for protection. But it's now possible to quantify the carbon removals that are foregone by cutting these forests down at a young age. While keeping intact and mature forests standing remains crucial, this research shows that protecting secondary forests — or in the case of production forests, delaying clear-cutting until after the peak age for carbon removal — warrants additional attention, as they can often provide the greatest per-hectare carbon removals. Additionally, some forests do not survive to their peak carbon removal age due to windthrow, pests, fire or drought (which are natural disturbances but are exacerbated by climate change). To effectively protect secondary forests, they must be managed for resilience to these risks.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Large-scale natural forest regeneration must start now. </strong></p><p> </p><p>That way, new forests can reach the age at which their carbon removal is greatest within the window of time that carbon removal is most needed to reach climate goals. Our research shows that delaying natural forest regeneration by five or 10 years decreases potential carbon removals globally by a quarter or half through mid-century, respectively, compared to starting natural regeneration in all reforestable areas now.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Policymakers and land managers can begin to make more strategic forest management decisions. </strong></p><p> </p><p>These maps can inform where and when the returns will be greatest from regrowing forests and/or letting forests continue to grow as a <a href=\"https://www.naturebase.org/\">natural climate solution</a>. They can be combined with forest restoration opportunity maps to estimate carbon removal in new forests over specified time horizons. They can also be integrated with maps of the age of naturally regenerating secondary forests and forest loss risk maps to estimate how much more carbon these forests could capture if they are left standing over specified time horizons.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Countries can improve their carbon accounting and make more accurate climate projections. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Compared to the removal rates in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html\">greenhouse inventory guidelines</a>, which are a common benchmark, the carbon removal rates we found are 26% lower for forests under 20 years old and 18% higher for those aged 20-100 years. (Differences vary by region.) This means governments and others that rely on IPCC rates are likely underestimating carbon removals by older secondary forests. Improved estimates could be used in developing Nationally Determined Contributions, place-based conservation and more.</p></li></ul><p>Protecting secondary forests should go together with conserving mature forests (which have high carbon densities and biodiversity) and investing in restoring forests where they have been lost, which will bring long-term climate and nature benefits. In other words, it shouldn't be one or the other, but all of the above.</p><p>Conservation and restoration also need to be done in ways that benefit the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332220304255\">more than 1 billion people</a> who live near or rely on forests. Secondary forests are often used by low-income or rural communities to support their livelihoods, and their protection must consider the needs, knowledge and wishes of local communities.</p><h3>Informing More Impactful Climate Solutions</h3><p>With <a href=\"https://research.wri.org/gfr/forest-extent-indicators/forest-loss\">forests under attack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/4/xii/ms3-e.htm\">under-valued</a>, the world needs to muster every resource it can to show how much value forests provide and prioritize their protection. Maintaining existing secondary forests, protecting mature forests and enabling new forests to grow are all important for strengthening the global forest carbon sink — but these must be done while also providing food, fiber and other resources on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore\">finite land</a> for a growing population.</p><p>Mapping carbon removal rates in forests is a rapidly advancing field. More ground data is needed from underrepresented regions, which includes most of the tropics (especially in Africa). We also need a better understanding of the human and environmental factors that affect carbon accumulation in forests. This can help inform <a href=\"https://www.naturebase.org/\">where and how</a> to focus forest protection efforts to maximize <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/tackle-climate-change/climate-change-stories/reforestation-natural-climate-solutions/\">nature-based carbon removals</a> within the context of social needs and other ecosystem benefits.</p><p>These maps provide another line of evidence for the value of forests. The new information can help practitioners and decision-makers focus forest restoration and protection efforts so that they are as effective as possible in averting further climate change.</p><p><em>This article was written in collaboration with Susan Cook-Patton and Nathaniel Robinson of The Nature Conservancy.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>BRUSSELS (June 23, 2025) </strong>– Earlier this year, the European Commission announced measures to simplify the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which is set to be enforced from 30 December 2025. Since then, a number of EU member states and political groups in the European Parliament have been pushing to further weaken the regulation — most recently during the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in May 2025, and in parliamentary committee discussions this month.</p><p>These attempts include proposals to create a “no-risk” country category, which could exempt certain countries from key due diligence obligations — potentially creating a loophole for deforestation-linked goods to enter the EU market with reduced oversight; and to postpone implementation to allow more time for simplifying the EUDR.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice-President and Regional Director for Europe, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“Renewed attempts to weaken and delay the EUDR are deeply concerning and could jeopardize global efforts to combat record-breaking forest loss. The <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\" HYPERLINK \"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">latest data shows</a> that in 2024 alone, the world lost 6.7 million hectares of tropical primary rainforest, an area nearly the size of the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>The proposed “no-risk” country category would erode the foundations of the EUDR's due diligence system, which is central to the law’s credibility and impact. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\">WRI's analysis from November 2024</a> shows it could open up major loopholes and make the regulation much less effective.</p><p>While concerns about implementation challenges are understandable, it's important to acknowledge that many businesses have already taken steps to comply.

      "description": "<h3>Highlights</h3><p>The Grain Belt Express is the highest capacity transmission line to ever be planned in the United States and the first to connect four grid regions. At 800 miles, it will connect Kansas and Indiana by passing through Missouri and Illinois. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs, generate millions of dollars in tax revenues and provide billions of dollars in energy cost savings for consumers. Despite these positive economic impacts, the line has generated grassroots opposition from landowners, which has delayed the line’s development for the past 13 years. While the program has not deployed a formal community benefits framework, we chose this project to highlight the importance of early, frequent and inclusive landowner engagement and put a spotlight on how restrictive state regulatory environments can make transmission development difficult.</p><h3>Context</h3><div class=\"bullets border-small\"><ul><li><strong>Project title</strong>: Grain Belt Express</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana</li><li><strong>Sector</strong>: Transmission</li><li><strong>Developer</strong>: Invenergy (2018-Present), Clean Line Energy (2010-2018)</li><li><strong>Community benefits framework type</strong>: None.</li></ul></div><h3>About the Project</h3><p>The Grain Belt Express (GBX) is an 800-mile, 5,000 megawatt, 600-kilovolt high-voltage direct current transmission line traversing and delivering energy to Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. The project was originally owned by the merchant transmission developer Clean Line Energy before it was sold to Invenergy in 2018. The GBX line runs entirely through private land, requiring easements, including in certain cases easements acquired through eminent domain authority to secure its path.</p><p>GBX is an important transmission line for the country because of its potential to increase grid reliability, strengthen interregional transfer capability and transport large quantities of energy from the Central Plains to densely populated centers in the Midwest. By building high-voltage transmission lines like GBX, the U.S. can reduce grid congestion and improve power system reliability, especially in the face of extreme weather events and increasing electricity demand.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1700\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1360\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1041\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"820\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"491\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Proposed Route of the Grain Belt Transmission Line\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/25-6-23-gbx-transmission-line-insights.png?VersionId=RkzwayGZ1Sw4.Z5oXdyozRqVt7tpLjWB&itok=ugseeO7f\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Proposed in 2010, GBX has secured state approval from all four of the states it will pass through.<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/#footnotes\"><sup>1</sup></a> The project is broken into <a href=\"https://grainbeltexpress.com/landowners/\">two phases</a>: Phase 1 will connect Kansas to northeast Missouri while Phase 2 will connect northeast Missouri to Indiana. Invenergy has <a href=\"https://www.kcur.org/news/2025-02-11/grain-belt-express-eminent-domain-petitions-missouri-power-line\">acquired 97%</a> of the land rights for Phase 1 and construction is expected to begin in 2026. Phase 2 does not have a start date yet.</p><p>Stakeholders who will be involved with the GBX project include landowners, farm bureaus, communities adjacent to the project and county governments.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><em><strong>Research Method</strong></em></p><p class=\"secondary\"><em>The information presented in this snapshot was obtained through semi-structured interviews with 41 landowners, developers, county commissioners and state officials. Interviews were conducted anonymously, and interviewees were, in some cases, offered honoraria for their time. Additional desk research about the line’s history, siting laws and regulatory procedures related to public utility facilities such as transmission lines was also conducted.</em></p></div><h3>Community Engagement</h3><p>Clean Line and later Invenergy engaged stakeholders across a diverse set of communities and several levels of government to obtain approval to build the GBX transmission line. This included applying for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN), or an equivalent authorization, from utility regulators in the four states. In Missouri, the term Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) is used. These certificates subject prospective transmission line routes to a review process that assesses the project’s environmental impact, costs and benefits. The certificates can also grant eminent domain or serve as a prerequisite for eminent domain .</p><p>The regulatory process to obtain approval for the project has been complex and subject to several legal disputes, including efforts by counties to block the project using road-crossing regulations. When the project began, Clean Line employees said in interviews that its “understanding of Missouri state law” was that the company needed approval from every county hosting the transmission line in Missouri, a procedure they adopted in Kansas as well. In 2017, the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC) rejected the GBX project, citing a previous Court of Appeals decision that said developers needed prior consent from every county impacted by the transmission line.</p><p>After it took over the project in 2018, Invenergy secured a CCN in Missouri without needing county approvals after the Missouri Supreme Court overturned the earlier Court of Appeals decision and instructed the Missouri PSC to re-evaluate the project without the county consent requirement. The Supreme Court clarified that while counties cannot block the construction of the transmission line, they can establish rules for how the GBX line crosses publicly owned roads. In other words, Invenergy would still need to negotiate with counties to acquire the necessary road crossing assents.</p><p>Clean Line and Invenergy’s engagement with counties and state public utilities commissions have been extensive and frequent to successfully navigate the complex regulatory landscape. Early in the project development process, Clean Line hosted open houses and workshops with county commissioners along the proposed line to identify and avoid areas they preferred not be developed in routing considerations. Invenergy continued engaging with state agencies and county commissioners after acquiring the project. GBX secured approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission in October 2023 after Invenergy <a href=\"https://grainbeltexpress.com/grain-belt-express-announces-expansion-increases-energy-savings-and-local-delivery/\">increased</a> the line’s capacity from 4,000 MW to 5,000 MW and reconfigured the facility to deliver up to half of the transmitted power to Missouri, facilitated by constructing an extra 40-mile connector line in the state.</p><p>The developers’ engagement with landowners, however, has been seen to be inadequate. Though Clean Line and Invenergy have stated that they were engaging with all impacted stakeholders, the perception among some stakeholders we interviewed was that Clean Line did not engage with landowners and the broader community early in the project. One landowner explained that they first had an open mind toward the GBX project, but became an ardent opponent after being turned away from a Clean Line press conference where they expected siting would be discussed. The landowner said they were told Clean Line was not yet ready to begin engaging with landowners. This exclusion led the landowner to mobilize opponents against the project for the next decade.</p><p>In interviews, other landowners expressed a wide array of concerns, including the use of eminent domain, potential visual and property value impacts and <a href=\"https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-Grid-Projects-Get-Stuck-Report.pdf\">reduced agricultural efficiency</a>.</p><p>In Missouri, grassroots opposition groups, such as the <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/property-question-prompts-latest-challenge-to-grain-belt-express\">Missouri Landowner Alliance</a> and the <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2022/10/04/missouri-agriculture-groups-renew-criticism-of-grain-belt-express-over-new-extension/#:~:text=Missouri%20agriculture%20groups%20renew%20criticism%20of%20Grain,Express%20over%20new%20extension%20%E2%80%A2%20Missouri%20Independent.\">Missouri Farm Bureau</a> have attempted to halt the GBX project and pushed for legislation to restrict or prohibit the use of eminent domain. The effort to revoke Invenergy’s ability to use eminent domain ultimately failed. However, in 2022, Missouri passed <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/22info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=r&BillID=77169426#:~:text=For%20condemnation%20of%20any%20agricultural,150%25%20of%20fair%20market%20value.\">legislation</a> requiring developers using eminent domain for electric transmission lines to pay landowners 150% of fair market value for agricultural and horticultural land, instead of the previous 100%. This legislation, endorsed by Invenergy, does not retroactively apply to GBX, but was <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2022/05/05/missouri-senate-approves-eminent-domain-reform-that-wouldnt-kill-grain-belt-express/\">seen as a way</a> to protect the state’s landowners from  <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2022/10/04/missouri-agriculture-groups-renew-criticism-of-grain-belt-express-over-new-extension/\">future large transmission line</a> projects, while still allowing the GBX project to move forward in Missouri.</p><p>In Illinois, the Illinois Farm Bureau and other landowner groups have also challenged the GBX project in court. An Illinois state appeals court <a href=\"https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1885305/invenergy-contest-illinois-ruling-against-grain-belt-express-transmission-line#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20month%2C%20an%20Illinois%20state%20appeals,other%20groups%20had%20objected%20to%20the%20approval.\">reversed the 2023 approval</a> by the Illinois Commerce Commission of the Illinois portion of the project. The Illinois Supreme Court has taken up Invenergy’s appeal of the decision.</p><p>As this case continues to be litigated, Invenergy is obtaining the majority of easements from landowners in Kansas and Missouri through voluntary agreements. According to Invenergy, GBX has secured <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2025/02/10/grain-belt-express-files-dozens-of-eminent-domain-petitions-to-build-power-line-across-missouri/\">over 1,450 easements</a> needed for the project, with 97% of landowners in Kansas and Missouri agreeing to the deals offered by the developer. Voluntary easements are often negotiated jointly by Invenergy employees and land agents from Contract Land Staff, a hired third-party agency specializing in land acquisition. For the rest, Invenergy is compensating landowners through eminent domain as a last resort.</p><h3>Project Benefits</h3><p>High-voltage transmission projects can benefit regional electricity grids through <a href=\"https://acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ACORE-The-Value-of-Transmission-During-Winter-Storm-Elliott.pdf\">enhanced</a> grid reliability by allowing more renewable <a href=\"https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_Climate_Progress_and_the_117th_Congress.pdf\">interconnection</a> and <a href=\"https://rmi.org/insight/states-in-sync-the-western-win-win-transmission-opportunity/\">lowering</a> energy system costs, all of which the developers of GBX have claimed in its CPCN <a href=\"https://www.icc.illinois.gov/docket/P2022-0499/documents/326508/files/568271.pdf\">applications</a> and promotional <a href=\"https://grainbeltexpress.com/\">materials</a>. Additionally, transmission projects can provide a series of direct benefits to host communities.</p><p>The GBX project is expected to provide its host communities with the following key benefits:</p><p><strong>Legal and Expected Benefits:</strong> These are legally required forms of compensation, such as taxes and easement payments, that naturally result from the development of a project.</p><ul><li><em>Taxes and construction impact mitigation payments:</em> The GBX project is expected to generate significant property tax revenues for counties along its route, offering them an opportunity to invest that revenue in essential services, such as schools and fire departments. In Missouri, the GBX project is expected to provide <a href=\"https://www.grainbeltexpress.mplshdrshared.com/overview.html\">$7 million</a> in property tax revenue in the first year of operation. In Kansas, Invenergy benefits from a 10-year tax exemption on high-voltage transmission development. As a result, instead of receiving revenues through a traditional taxation scheme, Kansas counties will receive a one time “construction mitigation payment fee” in the first 10 years of operation. The counties will receive <a href=\"https://www.kcc.ks.gov/images/PDFs/presentations-and-legislative-testimony/2025_KCC_Grain%20Belt%20Express%20Presentation_House.pdf\">$7,500 per mile of transmission</a> built within the counties’ boundaries, which amounts to a total of $2.8 million in payments to Kansas local governments. After 10 years, counties will receive standard tax revenues.</li><li><em>Eminent domain and land payments:</em> Invenergy will pay landowners to site the GBX project on their land through both voluntary easements and eminent domain, both of which are based on fair market evaluations. In Missouri and Kansas, Invenergy is expected to give <a href=\"https://www.grainbeltexpress.mplshdrshared.com/overview.html\">$35 million</a> in landowner payments in each state. Invenergy will pay landowners 110% of the fair market value of their land, plus an <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dept-of-energy/the-holdouts-in-the-quest-for-a-better-power-grid\">additional $18,000</a> for each tower placed on their property, with options for upfront or annual payments. Owners of century farms that have remained in the same family for over 100 years will receive an additional premium.</li><li><em>Job creation:</em> The project is estimated to create <a href=\"https://grainbeltexpress.com/benefits/\">22,300 direct jobs</a> during the construction of the line and the new generation it is expected to enable, while operations will create 960 full-time jobs.</li></ul><p><strong>Procedural benefits: </strong>Procedural benefits are a class of optional benefits that developers often undertake to maintain goodwill with host communities and secure local and state approval<strong>.</strong></p><ul><li><em>Providing local power:</em> GBX project will deliver up to 2,500 MW of power to the line’s Missouri interconnection point, a portion of which will serve 39 community-owned utilities in cities and small towns in the state through a power purchase agreement with members of the Missouri Public Utility Alliance. The initial amount of power was increased after the project’s first CCN was rejected and developers wanted to ensure the project would satisfy the state benefits test requirements projects are subjected to during CCN review.</li><li><em>Community grant program:</em> Invenergy provides one-time grants of up to $500 to local organizations located along the route of the transmission line. These grants are intended to support community needs, including food insecurity, community development and other local initiatives. Invenergy also donates to the county fairs where its line is planned and sponsors and publicizes local events. These actions, according to interviews with Invenergy, are helpful in building trust and maintaining goodwill with the community. </li></ul><h3>Strengths</h3><p>Below are some of the project’s strengths as they relate to community engagement and providing communities with tangible benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>The GBX project has demonstrated flexibility in its route design to address specific concerns.</strong> The project has made a series of modifications and adjustments to accommodate local and state interests and minimize environmental impacts. Both project developers made significant efforts to accommodate landowner siting requests. The project added the Tiger Connector, a 40-mile-long transmission line that will connect existing power infrastructure in Callaway County, Missouri, to the GBX transmission line in northern Missouri. The project was reconfigured to make it a 5,000 MW line, with half of the power delivered to Missouri. The project is also happening in two phases, enabling a gradual and phased approach to construction and development.</li><li><strong>Project developers remained committed to obtaining site control through voluntary easements even in the face of significant landowner opposition and litigation. </strong>Invenergy estimates that it needs <a href=\"https://hpj.com/2024/09/13/as-grain-belt-express-moves-nearer-to-construction-fights-move-to-center-stage/\">1,700 parcels of land</a> to secure its route. <a href=\"https://www.kcur.org/news/2025-02-11/grain-belt-express-eminent-domain-petitions-missouri-power-line\">Ninety-seven percent of property owners</a> in Kansas and Missouri have agreed to the deals offered by Invenergy, which also said that it has voluntarily secured over 1,450 easements needed for the project. This could suggest that Invenergy is accommodating landowner siting requests and providing substantial land payments through voluntary easements. Eminent domain is being used as a last resort after all attempts to negotiate with a landowner fail. Since 2021, Invenergy has used eminent domain in <a href=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2025/02/10/grain-belt-express-files-dozens-of-eminent-domain-petitions-to-build-power-line-across-missouri/\">40 instances</a> against Missouri property owners.</li></ul><h3>Challenges and Gaps</h3><ul><li><strong>The GBX project struggled to clearly articulate and communicate tax revenue benefits for counties along the transmission line.</strong> In our interviews, we found that county officials hold widely different estimates of revenues that will accrue to counties from the GBX project. County officials in Missouri and Illinois noted that they have “tremendous difficulty” estimating tax revenues from transmission development. A former Clean Line employee who was interviewed estimated that each mile of the line would generate $330,000 to $660,000 in taxes annually based on the line’s cost ($1 million to $2 million per mile and a utility tax rate of 33%). However, these estimates were met with skepticism from county commissioners, even as they welcomed a boost in revenues. The <a href=\"https://themissouritimes.com/capitol-braces-for-grain-belt-fight-what-to-know-about-the-proposed-project/\">Missouri Times</a> reported that the Missouri portion of GBX would likely pay about $7 million in property taxes in the first year of operation. This estimate would value the line’s tax potential at $35,000 per mile, nearly one-tenth the low estimate quoted by the former Clean Line developer. The ambiguity in estimating county tax revenue benefits can give government officials and other stakeholders a reason to oppose the project.</li><li><strong>Local opposition to the GBX project stemmed from the perception that benefits are spread broadly across large regions, but costs are concentrated along the transmission line. </strong>Interviews with landowners highlighted that the overall benefits of the project to their state and the nation, including grid reliability and provision of electricity to faraway places, were often not deemed sufficient to justify the project. Instead, they were concerned about the project’s potential to scar the landscape and negatively impact rural communities. Concerns were also raised about who is eligible for compensation. For instance, landowners whose land abuts transmission easements are not compensated for transmission’s visual and <a href=\"http://greatnortherntransmissionline.com/documents/RealEstate/Noise_Factsheet_v5.pdf\">noise pollution</a> One landowner described how a family-owned bed and breakfast, whose primary appeal was its rural aesthetic, expected to lose customers because the line would be sited next to their property. The bed and breakfast would not be compensated because they were not hosting the line. Similar complaints are cited in a<a href=\"https://efis.psc.mo.gov/Case/FilingDisplay/208205\"> hearing brief </a>to the Missouri Public Service Commission. This reveals how crucial it is for transmission developers to identify and engage with all locally impacted community groups and clearly articulate local economic benefits to build support for projects. The GBX project also highlights that transmission projects that confer wide benefits but impose localized costs can often be challenging to build support for.</li><li><strong>Building support among state and local leaders before approaching landowners can spur local opposition</strong>. Grassroots opposition is more likely when landowners are not clearly notified of a project impacting them. For example, one <a href=\"https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-Grid-Projects-Get-Stuck-Report.pdf\">landowner found out</a> about the GBX project from their farm bureau president. After calling around to both their neighbors and local government offices, they found that none of their neighbors knew about the project but in some cases, county commissioners and state legislators had already agreed to the project. Community members also expressed dissatisfaction with how Clean Line <a href=\"https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-Grid-Projects-Get-Stuck-Report.pdf\">communicated with individual landowners</a>. In interviews, they contrasted the strategy adopted by oil pipeline developers, who would approach landowners individually at the beginning to start easement negotiations. Clean Line said their initial strategy was to notify landowners that the transmission line would cross their property via mail. Former employees of Clean Line acknowledged in interviews the shortcomings of this approach and shared that in their new roles with other developers they now solicit siting requests first from landowners — not county officials — to avoid grassroots opposition.</li><li><strong>Community engagement was constrained by state regulatory environments.</strong> The requirement that transmission lines (with some exceptions) receive CPCNs from each state they pass through can expose projects that prioritize early-on landowner engagement to greater risk. Ideally, developers would fully secure their line route through private easements before seeking state approval to better accommodate landowner siting requests. However, the cost and time entailed in doing so, especially on a project as large as GBX, can be prohibitive when developers have no guarantee of receiving a CPCN, which could impact whether they can complete their project. The burden of seeking CPCNs from states can also result in benefits that meet state priorities but not those of local communities, impacting host communities’ acceptance of the project. The Missouri Public Service Commission gave its approval in 2023 only after Invenergy agreed to expand the project to provide more renewable electricity within Missouri. While the Missouri spur line may have been critical for the project’s development, interviews with county commissioners and landowners revealed that this did not improve GBX’s standing with local communities.</li></ul><div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">Further resources</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://grainbeltexpress.com/benefits/\">Invenergy’s Grain Belt Express Benefits Page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-Grid-Projects-Get-Stuck-Report.pdf\">The Harvard Salata Institute’s Case Study of Grain Belt Express</a></li></ul></div><p class=\"secondary\"> </p><p class=\"secondary\" id=\"footnotes\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\"><sup>1 </sup>GBX’s state approval is under appeal in Illinois having once before been granted and appealed by farming interest groups.

Despite the current political environment, <a href=\"https://weinrebgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-CSO-Report.pdf\">many remain committed</a> to advancing sustainability-related initiatives.</p><p>Yet companies often have a hard time moving from pledges and planning to real action. The private sector currently contributes <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2023\">just 18%</a> of all nature-positive investments, leaving much room for growth.</p><p>There are many reasons for this disconnect: Reporting and disclosure processes can be a burden. Incentives are often misaligned. Large-scale corporate financing for nature is still in its early stages, and some companies simply aren't sure where or how to begin.</p><p>But financing nature can be more accessible than it seems. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/guidebook-businesses-nature\">new WRI</a> research shows that companies don't necessarily need large teams or sustainability budgets to act — what they need is a more effective approach.</p><h3>Financing Nature Is Good Business</h3><p>Nature is not an abstract responsibility; it is a tangible asset that businesses can manage, protect and restore for measurable impact, whether or not it directly relates to their value chains. When companies finance nature and \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\">nature-based solutions</a>,\" they achieve real benefits — from enhanced resource security to stronger brand reputations. In turn, nature regenerates, increasing its value and providing essential services for businesses and communities alike.</p><p>For example, Six Senses Laamu (a coastal tourism business in the Maldives) is <a href=\"https://www.maldivesunderwaterinitiative.com/\">protecting hundreds of acres of seagrass</a>. This will support turtle and fish populations, enhance the ocean's carbon absorption capacity, and help protect against climate risks like storm surges. Critically, keeping local ecosystems healthy is also part of what keeps tourists coming back.</p><p>Elsewhere, food and beverage companies are investing in pollinator habitat restoration to protect their agricultural supply chains. General Mills is <a href=\"https://www.generalmills.com/news/press-releases/general-mills-invests-to-advance-regenerative-agriculture-in-canada-with-alus\">working with farmers</a> to plant wildflower meadows and hedgerows, supporting pollinators for crops like almonds, oats and wheat. Unilever has incorporated pollinator conservation into its <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/impact-results-from-unilevers-first-set-of-regenerative-agriculture-projects/\">regenerative agriculture strategy</a>, encouraging farming methods that promote biodiversity and soil health. These efforts improve crop yields, ecosystem resilience and soil fertility, as well as reduce reliance on harmful synthetic inputs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A sea turtle swimming in a seagrass meadow.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/seagrass-turtle-maldives_0.jpg?VersionId=oSF2I3CQmVZtPv49HTl9wZ6n4MZHL2_t&itok=b5dh4IXu\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>An endangered Hawksbill sea turtle swimming through protected seagrass meadows in the Maldives.

For example, <a href=\"https://deloitte.wsj.com/sustainable-business/salesforce-nature-positive-strategy-leader-why-investing-in-nature-matters-now-30423c51\">Salesforce</a> supports nature conservation as part of <a href=\"https://deloitte.wsj.com/sustainable-business/salesforce-nature-positive-strategy-leader-why-investing-in-nature-matters-now-30423c51\">its broader strategy</a> to mitigate climate risks, achieve net-zero goals and reinforce its brand value.</p><h3>What's Blocking Companies from Taking Action?</h3><p>While initiatives like these show great promise, they're still few and far between. In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2023\">only $200</a> billion was allocated to nature-based solutions, with 82% of this coming from governments. To meet global climate and nature targets, <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2023\">finance for nature-based solutions</a> must nearly triple to $542 billion per year by 2030 and quadruple to $737 billion per year by 2050, with private companies playing a much bigger role.</p><p>Yet that's easier said than done. We surveyed representatives from 41 companies of varying sizes and sectors and learned that they face a range of challenges in mobilizing finance for nature initiatives.</p><p>One reason is the persistent mindset that nature is merely a \"nice-to-have\" rather than a business imperative. This leaves some companies unaware of, or indifferent to, the benefits of nature initiatives.</p><p>How most key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets are structured may also be a barrier: The mid- to long-term planning often required for large-scale nature financing can be challenging for companies accustomed to short-term profit and loss considerations. Companies may struggle to identify a clear business case for financing nature initiatives, as the economic returns may be broad and longer-term, and less easily attributed to their own operations.</p><p>However, this is slowly shifting. Innovative finance models are resulting in companies beginning to place <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/project/nature-on-the-balance-sheet/\">nature on their balance sheet</a> and to invest in <a href=\"https://www.intrinsicexchange.com/\">natural asset companies</a> whose returns are based on environmental performance. Furthermore, nature continues to get <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/06/PS_2020.06.23_government-climate_REPORT.pdf\">broad public and political support</a>, implying that not paying proper attention to nature may risk reputational and operational risks in the long run.</p><p>Finally, we found that companies can end up spending more time and resources assessing and reporting on nature than actually implementing projects. This stems in part from a fragmented reporting landscape; some companies currently use <a href=\"https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P180724.pdf\">more than 3,000 metrics</a> to describe nature-related outcomes in their sustainability disclosures. Investors also require clear, quantifiable data, which can push companies to focus on reporting rather than pursuing new solutions. In fact, one <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-02-28-IBM-Study-Sustainability-Remains-a-Business-Imperative,-But-Current-Approaches-are-Falling-Short\">recent study</a> revealed that spending on sustainability reporting exceeds spending on sustainability innovation by 43%.</p><h3>A Practical Approach to Corporate Nature Action</h3><p>These myriad challenges can create a sort of analysis paralysis, with companies so mired in planning, assessing and reporting that they fail to deliver progress at the pace and scale needed. While building a business case and evaluating potential risks and opportunities are all critical, the speed and scale of the nature crisis demand more urgent action.</p><p>WRI has developed a structured decision-making framework to help companies move beyond prolonged assessments and take meaningful action for nature. Core to this framework is \"ARK\" approach:</p><ol><li><strong>(A)ssess </strong>support with key internal and external stakeholders and identify relevant opportunities for nature.</li><li><strong>(R)efine</strong> operational mechanisms by integrating nature into corporate strategy, securing financing and engaging with key stakeholders.</li><li><strong>(K)ick off and evaluate</strong> implementation with a clear governance structure; monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems; and ongoing evaluation to ensure long-term success.</li></ol><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1500\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"919\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"433\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Infographic showing a framework for corporate nature investments. \" height=\"433\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/25-insights-spark_0.png?VersionId=_JwtO4i0kmmL.R6tRW8wkGf0Ewh8.OAB&itok=IM7N3VrS\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The ARK framework emphasizes swift yet strategic decision-making.

But securing broader company support is important to driving meaningful action. Engaging multiple departments, socializing nature initiatives across the company, and fostering a shared understanding of their benefits can support a more collaborative and effective approach. This, in turn, can foster long-term commitment, integration into business strategies and, ultimately, successful implementation.</p><p>Externally, partnering with NGOs, academic institutions, Indigenous groups and local communities can <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/our-reports/delivering-more-insetting-through-nature-based-solutions\">build more effective initiatives</a>. According to our interviews and surveys, external parties were seen as helpful to provide expertise, share best practices, and streamline project design and implementation. This can be especially important if in-house teams are not established or do not have specific training or expertise in the field. Engaging with consortiums where companies share insights in collaborative manner (such as <a href=\"https://www.leafcoalition.org/\">LEAF Coalition</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/\">Symbiosis Coalition</a>) can also help identify credible partners for evaluating nature financing options.</p><h4>2) Refine operational mechanisms</h4><p>The next step is to set up and refine operational mechanisms for nature initiatives, such as internal governance and strategy, financial mechanisms, and supply chain management and procurement.</p><p>Conflicting KPIs and targets need to be identified and addressed from the start. As several interviews indicated, middle management may be particularly hesitant to advance nature-based projects when their targets are focused on increasing sales, revenues and margins. Sustainability or nature-oriented targets (which may generate non-financial or hard-to-quantify benefits) can be perceived as misaligned with these goals. Even after senior executive buy-in, effective communication and alignment with middle management are critical.</p><p>Some companies we interviewed are developing strategies to address competing interests. For example, a multinational pharmaceutical company successfully integrated sustainability into its management remuneration by ensuring that every middle manager was also compensated based on sustainability targets. A European building material company offers internal incentives for progress against sustainability goals, with approximately 30% of senior executives' bonuses linked to sustainability.</p><h4>3) Kick off and evaluate</h4><p>Companies should involve local communities, NGOs and government bodies in their implementation plans to ensure strong and sustained support. Nature initiatives are long-term endeavors that often involve or impact nearby communities, which means they need buy-in from relevant parties — including incorporating local knowledge and customs. Without this, projects could risk local pushback, drive social and economic displacement, or simply fail to deliver the intended outcome. There are risks to companies, too, including accusations of greenwashing claims and reputational damage.</p><p>Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems are important for ensuring that <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2019/12/monitoring-and-evaluation_30a9e9a7/82d55c1a-en.pdf\">activities meet their objectives</a> in the most efficient and effective way possible. Properly designed M&E systems allow for iterative and adaptive learning, meaning companies can improve implementation over time. This may help relieve some of the burden of assessing every potential outcome upfront.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People planting mangroves along a coast.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/mangrove-planting-banda-aceh_0.jpg?VersionId=CxngspzeEXRaWBk_2I9Jg8jTfHfUpO9g&itok=z3Nx0I8e\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A mangrove planting initiative in Banda Aceh, Indonesia intended to help prevent erosion and protect coastal ecosystems.

Photo by Muhammad Hudari</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>One respondent recommended that, given the subjective nature of some aspects of environmental work, having a credible third-party partner to validate progress is essential. Transparency around a project's strategy, parameters and MRV processes — coupled with an iterative approach to improvement — can also help build confidence among investors and partners.</p><p>Another interviewee pointed out that, despite a wealth of learning and data collected in the field of nature-based solutions, much of this remains siloed within divisions, companies and sectors, limiting opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing. Greater cross-collaboration between companies and across industries and regions can help address this challenge and enable action on a larger scale.</p><p>For example, through the <a href=\"https://rimbacollective.com/\">Rimba Collective</a>, consumer goods manufacturers are working together to achieve their corporate sustainability objectives over the long-term, at scale, by protecting and restoring natural landscapes and supporting livelihoods. By collaborating, these companies can aggregate projects and landscape initiatives, along with impact KPIs, to mitigate risks associated with earlier-stage projects.</p><h3>Embracing Nature as a Business Imperative</h3><p>The path forward is clear: Businesses must treat nature as a strategic asset, essential to driving innovation, building resilience and creating long-term value. By securing supply chains, reducing liabilities, unlocking financial opportunities and enhancing brand value, companies that embrace this approach today will set themselves up to lead the future economy.</p><p>The good news is that meaningful change is achievable. By integrating nature into core business strategies, financing impactful projects and collaborating across sectors, business leaders can drive the transformation needed to restore and protect the planet's life-support systems — the foundation of our societies and economies.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Nearly a decade ago, the world rallied around the Paris Agreement on climate change and the goal of holding global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F). Since then, the “1.5C goal” has become the world’s North Star for climate action — a critical benchmark against which policies are set and progress is measured. <strong>But an </strong><a href=\"https://wmo.int/sites/default/files/2025-03/WMO-1368-2024_en.pdf\"><strong>alarming wave of recent data</strong></a><strong> underscores just how close we are to surpassing this widely cited threshold.</strong></p><p>Atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide reached its highest level in 2 million years last year. 2024 also marked the first single year in which global average surface temperature rose more than 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.

A temperature goal emerged later, as scientific assessments, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/pres_96_188\">European Council</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2009/declaration.pdf\">G8</a> initially converged on a benchmark of 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels. The 2010 Cancun Agreements became the first global agreements to reference 2 degrees C, while also recognizing the potential for a stronger 1.5 degrees C limit. </p><p>In the lead-up to the 2015 Paris Agreement, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/sb/eng/inf01.pdf\">experts </a>concluded that even 2 degrees C of warming <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-change-effects-cities-15-vs-3-degrees-C\">posed severe risks</a>. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) pushed hard during the agreement’s negotiations for a more stringent limit, resulting in a compromise: Countries agreed to collectively limit warming to “well below 2 degrees C” and “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5 degrees C, reflecting growing recognition of the heightened risks from every fraction of a degree of temperature rise.</p><p id=\"how-goal-is-used\">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s pre-eminent group of climate scientists, then prepared <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\">a report</a> on the 1.5 degrees C goal. They found a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15c-and-2c-warming\">stark contrast</a> in climate change impacts under 1.5 vs. 2 degrees C of warming. They also mapped what it would take to stay within the 1.5 degrees C limit.</p><h3>How Is the 1.5 Degrees C Goal Used? </h3><p>Since its adoption in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the 1.5 degrees C goal has served both as a powerful rhetorical symbol and as the basis for concrete technical benchmarks.</p><p>Vulnerable countries, NGOs and diplomats alike invoke the 1.5 degrees C goal to highlight what’s at stake in UN climate negotiations and other policy decisions. Climate-vulnerable nations like small island states have long framed 1.5 degrees C as a matter of survival, popularized in the phrase “1.5 to stay alive.” Youth movements and UN leaders, including Secretary-General António Guterres, have repeatedly called for urgent action to keep 1.5 degrees C “within reach.”</p><p>Technically, the 1.5 degrees C goal underpins a range of benchmarks and scientific assessments of climate action. It’s used to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">evaluate the ambition</a> of countries’ national climate commitments (known as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/ndcs/\">“nationally determined contributions” (NDCs)</a>) and corporate emissions-reduction targets. It helps scientists estimate the remaining carbon budget — the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> the world can still emit while limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C. The 1.5 degrees C-aligned pathways assessed by the IPCC form the basis for emissions-reduction timelines (such as the widely cited global benchmark of reducing emissions <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/\">43% below 2019 levels by 2030</a>), deadlines for reaching net-zero emissions, and sector-specific targets like phasing out coal or replacing fossil-fueled vehicles with electric ones.</p><p id=\"goal-exceeded\">These timelines and benchmarks, in turn, underpin accountability tools like the <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024\">Emissions Gap Report</a>, the <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/\">Science-Based Targets Initiative</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/state-climate-action-2023\">State of Climate Action</a> report.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A woman grows cabbages in rural Kenya\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/kenyan-cabbage-farmer_0.jpg?VersionId=dQBiXzjxyn3NxGZgVvi4f80T_QY.j6Xk&itok=WY4miww7\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A woman tends to her cabbages in rural Kenya.

(Some regions — including, critically, those <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2/#2.3.1.1.3\">over land</a> — tend to warm more than average, while others warm less.)</li><li>While the Paris Agreement does not define “<strong>pre-industrial levels,</strong>” scientists like those in the IPCC typically use 1850-1900. This period marks the beginning of reliable global temperature records.</li><li>Today’s global average temperature is then compared to past conditions. The difference between the two is called the <strong>temperature anomaly.</strong></li></ul><p>By scientific convention, the Paris goal refers to a sustained temperature anomaly <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cop27_auv_CP%2013_PR2.pdf\">over a period of at least 20 years</a>. This approach smooths out the effects of year-on-year temperature fluctuations due to factors like <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-much-el-nino-affect-global-temperature/\">El Niño/La Niña</a>, volcanic activity and changes in ocean circulation to provide a better estimate of human-caused warming. Scientists typically assess whether the long-term average exceeds 1.5 degrees C at any point during the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and specifically in 2100. If warming temporarily exceeds the threshold before falling back below it by the end of the century, this is referred to as “overshoot.”</p><p id=\"has-earth-already-exceeded-goal\">Under this approach, the year in which a given temperature threshold is breached is the middle year of the 20-year period. As <a href=\"https://wmo.int/sites/default/files/2025-03/WMO-1368-2024_en.pdf\">WMO</a> put it, “1.5 degrees C of warming would only be confirmed once the observed temperature has reached that level over a 20-year period, 10 years after the year of exceedance. Thus, there would be a 10-year delay in recognizing and reacting to exceedance of the long-term temperature goal.” The scientific community is considering alternative approaches that would require less delay to confirm the year of exceedance.</p><h3>Has the Earth Already Exceeded 1.5 Degrees C of Warming?</h3><p>Yes, but it hasn’t yet breached the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/state-of-the-climate-2024-sets-a-new-record-as-the-first-year-above-1-5c/\">2024</a> was the first full year on record in which the global average temperature was more than 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, with an estimated anomaly of <a href=\"https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level\">1.55 degrees C</a>. This continued an alarming pattern in which the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Prior to 2024, no full year had seen such a large temperature anomaly; though there were shorter periods — days, weeks and months — for which temperatures temporarily exceeded 1.5 degrees C. The WMO <a href=\"https://wmo.int/sites/default/files/2025-05/WMO_GADCU_2025-2029_Final.pdf\">forecasts a 70% chance</a> that the next five years will exceed 1.5 degrees C on average.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23709217/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Importantly, a single hot year does not mean the Paris Agreement temperature goal has been breached or is no longer within reach. The global long-term average temperature anomaly is currently estimated at around <a href=\"https://wmo.int/sites/default/files/2025-03/WMO-1368-2024_en.pdf\">1.34 degrees C to 1.41 degrees C</a>, depending on the method used.</p><p id=\"what-happens-if-we-breach\">Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02247-8\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02246-9\">recent</a> climate modeling studies suggest that last year’s high temperatures likely mean the world has already entered the 20-year period in which the average temperature anomaly will breach the 1.5 degrees C limit.</p><h3>What Happens if We Breach 1.5 Degrees C of Warming?</h3><p>At current levels of 1.34 degrees C-1.41 degrees C of warming, we are already experiencing more frequent and intense heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods. Food and water security are under growing pressure. Ecosystems like coral reefs are suffering irreversible damage. Surpassing 1.5 degrees C — even temporarily — augments the risks associated with these and other impacts.</p><p>According to the IPCC, even warming of 1.5 degrees C would expose nearly 1 billion people to <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4/\">water stress and desertification</a>, cost an estimated $63 billion in adaptation and residual <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-5/\">damages to major crops</a>, and put <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2/\">14% of the world’s species at risk</a> of extinction. About 24% more people would face flooding compared to historical levels, <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3/\">coral reefs</a> would decline by 70-90%, and the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7/\">distribution of malaria</a> would expand.</p><p>These same climate impacts would <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ipcc-report-2022-climate-impacts-adaptation-vulnerability\">intensify</a> if we exceed 1.5 degrees of warming. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/2023-ipcc-ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-findings\">relative to 1.5 degrees C of warming</a>, 2 degrees C of warming is expected to cause twice as many heat waves in Southern Africa, 1.6 times as much area burnt by wildfires in Mediterranean Europe, and cost $17 billion more globally in residual damage and adaptation for major crops. 2 degrees C of warming would also functionally destroy coral reefs. Extreme heatwaves would become increasingly common, creating dire impacts on human health and productivity, especially in South Asian and African cities.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"2962\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"2370\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1815\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"1429\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"856\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Climate impacts chart.\" height=\"856\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/climate-impacts_0.png?VersionId=4mw3QeT69L_MkJre.anparX8KB4j4WoI&itok=DFOXmQTI\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Breaching 1.5 degrees C also increases the risk of crossing <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950\">tipping points</a> — critical thresholds beyond which parts of Earth may undergo abrupt, self-perpetuating and potentially irreversible changes. For example, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are at risk of collapse, worsening sea-level rise and disrupting ocean currents. Low-latitude coral reefs could die off entirely, a devastating blow for biodiversity and those whose livelihoods depend on fisheries. And boreal permafrost may abruptly thaw, releasing vast quantities of climate-warming methane into the atmosphere.</p><p>These systems are at risk of crossing tipping points around 1.5 degrees C. At higher temperatures, additional ice sheets, ocean circulation systems and ecosystems could completely collapse. Many tipping points shift systems from one stable state to another — such as the Amazon rainforest turning to savannah. Once these kinds of shifts occur, it becomes very hard or even impossible to reverse them on human timescales.</p><p id=\"possibility-to-hold-warming\">The bottom line is that with every additional fraction of a degree of warming, the impacts become harder or even impossible to adapt to. This is what’s known as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loss-damage-climate-change\">loss and damage</a>. Losses and damages can be economic, such as shrinking industries and associated loss of jobs and livelihoods. But the toughest are often those that can’t be quantified in economic terms — such as the <a href=\"https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/coast-climate-adaptation-library/pacific-islands/micronesia/Monnereau--Abraham.--2013.--Loss-and-Damage-in-Kosrae,-Federal-State-of-Micronesia.pdf\">losing burial grounds</a>, family homes and loved ones.</p><h3>Is it Still Possible to Hold Warming to 1.5 Degrees C?</h3><p>In theory, it is still <em>physically </em>possible to avoid spending down the carbon budget required to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C through rapid, sustained emissions reductions. But the <em>plausibility </em>of executing the transformations at the pace and scale required is another matter.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/\">2022 IPCC report</a> on climate change mitigation identifies pathways for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C with no or limited overshoot. They entail “<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/resources/spm-headline-statements/\">rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas reductions in all sectors</a>.” Specifically, greenhouse gas emissions would have peaked before 2025 and would decline by 43% by 2030 (from 2019 levels), and by 60% by 2035. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would reach net zero by around 2050, before exhausting the <a href=\"https://globalcarbonbudget.org/\">carbon budget</a>. Concretely, this would involve phasing out unabated fossil fuel consumption, dramatically scaling up zero-carbon power, expanding sustainable transport, electrifying transport and industry, and halting deforestation. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-ways-remove-carbon-pollution-sky\">Removal of carbon from the atmosphere</a> — by uptake in trees and through technologies — would also need to scale up dramatically.</p><p>The problem is that we are not following those pathways. The State of Climate Action report found that of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-action-progress-1-5-degrees-c\">42 key milestones</a> needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, only one — the <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/transport/transition-zero-carbon-cars-trucks-and-buses?indicatorId=2256&tab=timeline\">share of electric vehicles</a> in light-duty vehicle sales — is currently on track for 2030. Despite significant increases in <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/power/rapidly-scale-zero-carbon-electricity-generation?indicatorId=2238&tab=timeline\">renewable energy capacity</a> and <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/transport/transition-zero-carbon-cars-trucks-and-buses?indicatorId=2256&tab=timeline\">electric vehicle sales</a>, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024\">nearly 80%</a> of global energy still comes from fossil fuels, the world is <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025/coal\">burning more coal</a> than ever before, and <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">deforestation continues at alarming rates</a>. <a href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/report/boom-and-bust-coal-2024/\">Coal</a> and <a href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-gas-infrastructure-tracker/\">gas</a> infrastructure continue to expand.</p><p>As a result, the world still emits 42 GtCO<sub>2</sub> per year (and an additional 14 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e of other greenhouse gases). <strong>The remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C is </strong><a href=\"https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2025-250/essd-2025-250.pdf\"><strong>130 Gt</strong></a><strong> CO<sub>2</sub>, which will be consumed in just over three years at current annual rates.</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23803529/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In simple, back-of-the-envelope terms, a linear path from 2024 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to net-zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that stays within the remaining carbon budget would require cutting emissions by nearly 6 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> per year, starting immediately and for the rest of the decade. For comparison, the economic shock during the COVID-19 pandemic caused CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to drop by only <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/40932/EGR2022_ESEN.pdf?sequence=8\"> 2 Gt</a> in 2020, and the decline was temporary.</p><p>Achieving sustained emissions cuts of the magnitude needed would require unprecedented political and corporate leadership, backed by citizens, leading to a comprehensive and coordinated structural transformation across sectors and economies. There is scant evidence that such a deep transformation is poised to begin in the near future. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02073-4\">One recent study</a> found that while it is still theoretically possible to limit warming to below 1.6 degrees C at around 50% likelihood, the probability drops to between 5% and 45% when considering institutional and other barriers.</p><p id=\"should-a-new-goal-be-chosen\">All these factors suggest that long-term average temperatures are likely to surpass 1.5 degrees C, at least temporarily. By how much, and for how long, is still very much in play.</p><h3>Should a New Goal Be Chosen if 1.5 Degrees C Is Surpassed?</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/29768659241293218\">skepticism about the feasibility of the 1.5 degrees C goal</a> has grown, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02247-8\">some scientists</a> have proposed refocusing attention on limiting warming to “well below 2 degrees C” or returning warming to 1.5 degrees C after temporarily overshooting it. But adopting new benchmarks consistent with a higher temperature outcome poses another challenge: If derived from the modeling scenarios available today, these benchmarks would have the world reduce emissions more slowly and phase out fossil fuels later than we currently aim to do — an ineffective response to increasingly severe climate impacts. </p><p id=\"what-should-we-do\">At the same time, our rhetoric should acknowledge the evolving reality. If long-term global average temperature rise surpasses 1.5 degrees C, it will no longer make sense to frame action in terms of what’s required “to avoid breaching the 1.5 degrees C limit.” Instead, we can refer to minimizing overshoot, stabilizing at the lowest feasible temperature, and avoiding as much warming as we can to protect people’s lives and economies.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A young girl carries water through an informal settlement in Johannesburg, South Africa.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2024-09/johannesburg-informal-housing.jpg?VersionId=1A_qOFI_7zPFJomOj4duIhFdavBzBS18&itok=qiq5Izuz\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A young girl carries water through an informal settlement in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Because warming will continue to increase <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/\">until CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reach net zero</a>, reducing net emissions will remain critical. And because most adaptation planning scenarios already envision the possibility of exceeding 1.5 degrees C, it is more important to ensure those plans are <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/figures/chapter-6/figure-6-004\">implemented</a> than to develop new plans for higher-temperature scenarios.</p><p>Breaching 1.5 degrees C, however, does augment the scale and pace of action ultimately required, and may introduce new risks and trade-offs. For example, the further we exceed the carbon budget, the more CO<sub>2</sub> will need to be removed from the atmosphere, demanding greater investment in CO<sub>2</sub> removal. While most adaptation plans already account for higher temperatures, reaching those levels earlier shortens the planning horizon. Failing to keep pace could increase costs, result in inadequate adaptation, or even compound the risk of <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17/\">maladaptation</a>. The world would also need to prepare to address higher levels of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loss-damage-climate-change\">loss and damage</a>, consequences of climate change that exceed what people can adapt to. Finally, breaching the established temperature goal may lend salience to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/opinion/geoengineering-climate-change-technology-africa.html\">controversial</a> <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-six-ideas-to-limit-global-warming-with-solar-geoengineering/\">solar radiation modification (SRM) approaches</a> that would temporarily cool the planet by reflecting sunlight. While SRM is <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/chapter/chapter-14/\">risky</a> and untested, its relatively low direct cost and potential to stem near-term warming point to the potential for unilateral deployment, which would require more proactive <a href=\"https://www.overshootcommission.org/\">oversight</a> and governance.</p><p>And while surpassing 1.5 degrees C is increasingly likely, the extent and duration of warming — and its associated impacts — remain within our control. Limiting peak warming will require deep and sustained emissions cuts, maintaining and enhancing <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/forests-absorb-twice-much-carbon-they-emit-each-year\">carbon sinks</a>, and strengthening resilience. Achieving these outcomes depends not only on geophysical and technological factors, but also on a step change in political and corporate leadership. Leaders must foster the right <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/figures/chapter-3/figure-3-42\">economic conditions</a> for clean technologies to take hold, adopt public policies that catalyze investment in emissions reductions and resilience, and ensure people see economic and social benefits from low-carbon development.</p><p>Ultimately, every fraction of a degree matters. Decisions made today will continue to shape climate risk for generations to come.</p>",

      "description": "<p>South Africa’s cities face growing threats to their water resources, especially rivers, as rapid development and climate change undermine the health of water systems and the ecosystem services they provide. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to serious flood risks during extreme weather events.</p><p>Without effective river management, cities risk losing out on valuable financial, socioeconomic, human and ecological benefits. In contrast, well-managed rivers enhance the delivery of municipal services, improve adaptation capacity and boost resilience to climate shocks.</p><p>The eThekwini Municipality, which includes the city of Durban, is one of the first South African cities to take steps to protect and revitalize its rivers. Its work has become an example for others to follow, including Johannesburg, where WRI and partners are helping improve its water resilience.</p><h3>What Did eThekwini Do to Build Water Resilience?</h3><p>eThekwini’s rapid economic growth, intense urbanization and climate change have degraded its natural ecosystems. Many of its rivers and coastlines are affected by pollution, while its coastal forests and wetlands are being lost to housing development or invasive species.</p><p>In response to climate-induced environmental damage to communities and infrastructure, eThekwini Municipality launched South Africa’s first Transformative Riverine Management Program (TRMP) in 2020. With support from C40 City Finance Facility, eThekwini embarked on the long journey of transforming the management of its rivers and bringing them back to life.  Through the TRMP — eThekwini has developed a high-level roadmap and business case for the rehabilitation and protection of its riverine assets.</p><p> Its TRMP was the first to clearly link effective riverine management with the longevity of both natural and urban infrastructure and showed how every rand spent would yield 1.8 to 3.4 times in holistic benefits. eThekwini also created its Catchment Partnership Development Frameworks to guide climate adaptation and risk mitigation in specific river catchments, using spatial planning and corridor management to protect residents and infrastructure.</p><h3>Johannesburg Co-Develops Plan to Build Water Resilience</h3><p>Through the SUNCASA (Scaling Urban Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa) project, WRI and International Institute of Sustainable Development (IISD) are working with local partners to restore the riverine areas of the Upper Jukskei River and enhance urban forestry. The consortium of local partners includes the City of Johannesburg, Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo, Zutari, Johannesburg Inner City Partnership, Alexandra Water Warriors, GenderCC and Water for the Future.</p><p>Johannesburg, along with neighboring municipalities Tshwane and Ekurhuleni, has one of the region’s highest population densities and most degraded rivers whose hydrological boundaries are shared between the cities. The buildup of solid waste and debris, along with alien invasive plants, in the Jukskei River has increased flood risk.</p><p>Through the SUNCASA project, Zutari is leading the development of a TRMP, which includes a riverine management program and business case for the restoration of the Upper Jukskei — highlighting the first 15-kilometer (9-mile) stretch from the start of the river in the city center to Alexandra.</p><p>Initial TRMP assessments indicate that neighborhoods like Alexandra present the greatest opportunity for intervention. Hydro-ecological and socioeconomic vulnerability assessments found that infrastructure and communities near Queen’s Wetland in Bez Valley and Alexandra — where flood plains have been transformed or encroached — are most at risk. The assessments highlight how apartheid-era inequalities have left high-density, low-income neighborhoods especially vulnerable to climate, economic and social risks.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"949\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1342\" />\n              <source height=\"891\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"682\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"537\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"322\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Queens wetland and Bruma lake flood extents.\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/queens-wetland-and-bruma-lake-flood-extents_0.png?VersionId=BQulp.qVRtolZ556.yt7DRwIhH5eWJtP&itok=-xEf2X7E\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) model was used to develop high-level flood extents for the Jukskei River’s path across Johannesburg.

Johannesburg also shared why it embarked on developing a TRMP and reported on progress to date.</p><h3><strong>Takeaways from the Exchange:</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Rivers cross borders</strong>: In Gauteng, rivers flow in and out of different municipalities. It is important, particularly in this region, that local governments work together to address riverine management.</li><li><strong>Collecting learning accelerates progress</strong>: Sharing insights and knowledge across municipalities is essential for regional urban resilience.</li><li><strong>Shared responsibility</strong>: Local governments must work closely with all stakeholders — including all city government departments, civil society organizations, communities and the private sector — to drive action toward urban water resilience. Strong partnerships and communication channels create the enabling environment needed for greater impact.</li></ol><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1138\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"910\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"697\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"549\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"329\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People in meeting with trees.\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/design-sem-nome-2_0.png?VersionId=IUcqrVt6VVZLrt1Wk8_GnTxcOePNU2oP&itok=7-aAchob\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The knowledge exchange between four municipalities shared insights from eThekwini’s TRMP experience to help other South African cities develop their own programs.

Zutari and partners will also prepare an implementation framework and investment briefs to support the city in scaling up riverine management.</p><p>WRI will continue facilitating collaboration between Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni through the SUNCASA project and, together with IISD, will also support the city in structuring funding opportunities. This will help expand the TRMP approach to other river systems in Johannesburg and neighboring municipalities, building urban resilience through integrated catchment management.</p><p>To scale these efforts, WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/green-gray-infrastructure-accelerator\">Green-Gray Infrastructure Accelerator</a> aims to embed nature-positive approaches in urban development through policy instruments, a portfolio of Green-Gray Infrastructure projects and innovative financing to deliver climate-resilient outcomes in Johannesburg.</p>",
