      "description": "<p>The center of gravity for <a href=\"https://time.com/7332240/cop30-brazil-climate-energy-global-south/\">climate progress</a> is shifting. Increasingly, many of the countries driving the global climate transition are those that have contributed the least to historical emissions yet are among the most vulnerable to climate impacts. Emerging economies are showing that climate action is not only a moral imperative but a pathway to competitiveness, resilience and economic growth. Colombia exemplifies this broader movement: A country that, despite <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/countries/COL?end_year=2022&start_year=1990\">accounting for just 0.59% of global emissions</a>, has consistently chosen to lead.</p><p>This leadership stands out at a time when collective ambition is failing to keep pace with the urgency of the climate crisis. 2025 was meant to be a pivotal year for climate action, with countries submitting new climate plans, known as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs), which set emission reduction and climate adaptation goals for the next decade. By the end of 2025, <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">125 countries</a> had submitted new NDCs. While this shows progress, the combined ambition of these commitments <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/assessing-2025-ndcs\">still falls short</a> of what is needed to keep the world within <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/1-5-degrees-c-target-explained\">critical warming thresholds</a>.</p><p>Historically, Colombia’s NDCs have been among the most ambitious in the Latin American and Caribbean region. <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-06/Colombia%20iNDC%20Unofficial%20translation%20Eng.pdf\">The country’s first NDC submission in 2015</a> committed to reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below business-as-usual (BAU) levels by 2030, or up to 30% with international support. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/colombia-shows-leadership-race-against-climate-change\">In 2020, Colombia strengthened its ambition</a>, increasing its 2030 target to a <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-06/NDC%20actualizada%20de%20Colombia.pdf\">51% emissions reduction below BAU</a>.</p><p>Five years later in 2025, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-colombia-updates-its-climate-commitments-2035\">Colombia submitted its updated NDC</a>, presenting its 2035 target as an absolute emissions limit. Under this approach, the country commits to limit its emissions in 2035 to between 155 million and 161 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Notably, the 2035 limit is lower than Colombia’s 2030 emissions level under its previous NDC target, signaling a downward emissions trajectory consistent with the country’s goal of reaching net zero by 2050. Because the target is framed as an absolute limit — without an equivalent percentage reduction relative to a projected BAU scenario — it cannot be expressed directly as a single percentage reduction, as in previous NDC cycles. <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/BTR1_Colombia.pdf\">Colombia’s first Biennial Transparency Report</a> provides emissions projections only up to 2030 and notes that the country is still building the technical capacity to extend modeling to 2035 and 2050, with updated emissions projections expected in its second transparency report in 2026.</p><p>The new NDC also frames an adaptation component around a long-term goal: Reducing the risk and socio-economic impacts of climate variability and change. It’s structured across eight territorial dimensions — biodiversity and ecosystem services, water resources, food security and agricultural production, human health, human habitat, infrastructure, disaster risk, and cultural heritage —  within the <a href=\"https://siivra.ideam.gov.co/\">Integrated Information System for Vulnerability, Risk and Adaptation</a> (SIIVRA, by its Spanish acronym), helping ensure actions are measurable and trackable over time.</p><p>Colombia’s NDC also sets out clear needs for support to implement its adaptation component, recognizing that domestic resources alone are insufficient to deliver its resilience goals. It identifies four gaps: finance, technology transfer, capacity-building, and planning and governance. It highlights, for example, an estimated funding shortfall of around 0.13% of Colombia’s GDP per year, roughly 2 trillion Colombian pesos annually ($540 million) to meet 2030 adaptation targets, and the need to strengthen technical and operational capacity across levels of government to plan, implement and monitor adaptation measures effectively.</p><p>The NDC calls for international support, particularly in finance, capacity-building and technology transfer, and emphasizes the need for consolidating the SIIVRA as a monitoring tool. It also takes stock of Colombia’s National Adaptation Plan, noting that a 2025 assessment found the 2012 Plan helped build knowledge but had limited impact on structural change, with progress largely concentrated in diagnostics and pilot projects. As a result, the NDC underscores the need for technical and financial support to update the National Adaptation Plan into a stronger framework with verifiable goals aligned with the NDC and the long-term climate strategy.</p><p>The NDC also stands out for including a dedicated narrative on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loss-damage-climate-change\">loss and damage</a>, acknowledging that some climate impacts are already severe and, in some cases, irreversible. It estimates the annual economic loss from climate events at 4.03 trillion Colombian pesos ($1.1 billion). It also highlights forced human displacement as a major non-economic impact, recognizing it as an increasingly visible consequence of floods, droughts and other disasters. In 2023 alone, Colombia registered 351,000 new internal displacements linked to climate-related events. In response, the country proposes developing a National Framework for Loss and Damage to better coordinate sectoral action and financing, while also seeking to mobilize support through the international <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/fund-for-responding-to-loss-and-damage\">Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage</a> established at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28).</p><p>While Colombia’s new NDC covers a wide range of sectors, three in particular are worth watching closely: forests, energy and cities. Land-use change and energy are Colombia’s largest sources of emissions, while the energy sector sits at the heart of the climate transition amid ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. As most Colombians live in increasingly vulnerable urban areas, cities are critical for both climate mitigation and adaptation. Together, these three areas offer valuable insights not only into Colombia’s pathway to 2035 but also for other countries navigating similar challenges.</p><h3>1) Nature at the Center of Climate Ambition</h3><p>In its latest NDC submission, Colombia increases its ambition on forests and biodiversity under the framework of “Peace with Nature” and a biocultural protection approach. <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile?country=co\">The country is recognized as one of the world’s megadiverse countries</a>, hosting nearly 10% of global biodiversity, including <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/BTR1_Colombia.pdf\">around 67,000 species</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/BUR3%20-%20COLOMBIA.pdf\">Colombia’s natural forests cover approximately 59.7 million hectares</a>, representing 52.3% of the national terrestrial territory, with the Amazon accounting for roughly two-thirds of this area. Yet deforestation remains a significant challenge: Between 2002 and 2024, <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/COL/?location=WyJjb3VudHJ5IiwiQ09MIl0%3D&map=eyJjYW5Cb3VuZCI6dHJ1ZX0%3D\">Colombia lost an estimated 2.1 million hectares of primary humid forest</a>, mostly driven by agricultural expansion (particularly extensive cattle ranching), the cultivation of illicit crops and land grabbing.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27301476/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The country reaffirms its commitment to tackling deforestation by setting a 2030 target to reduce the annual deforestation rate to 50,000 hectares and a more ambitious 2035 target to limit deforestation to between 37,500 and 49,999 hectares per year. In parallel, Colombia commits to the <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/protect-water-and-land/land-and-water-stories/committing-to-30x30/\">global 30x30 goal</a>, aiming to protect at least 30% of its continental and marine territory by 2030.</p><p>The NDC also positions the Amazon biome as a strategic pillar for national and regional climate stability, given its essential role in stabilizing regional climate patterns, capturing and storing large volumes of carbon, and maintaining ecosystem connectivity across the Andes–Amazon–Orinoquía system. To achieve this, the NDC aims to prevent new mineral and hydrocarbon exploration in the region, thereby preserving its ecological integrity. Importantly, it recognizes <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">Indigenous territories</a> as fundamental spaces for climate action and, for the first time, includes specific measures developed in collaboration with Indigenous peoples to protect biodiversity based on traditional knowledge systems.</p><p>Beyond the NDC, <a href=\"https://www.radionacional.co/noticias-colombia/gobierno-firma-8-decretos-para-entidades-territoriales-indigenas-en-amazonia\">Colombia has recently taken steps to strengthen Indigenous self-governance in the Amazon</a>, including the formalization of the country’s first <a href=\"https://gaiaamazonas.org/recursos/colombia-entidades-territoriales-indigenas-amazonia-eti/\">Indigenous Territorial Entities</a> in the eastern Colombian Amazon. This recognizes Indigenous governments as legitimate governing bodies with greater responsibilities for territorial and environmental management.</p><p>Colombia’s NDC also includes measures to manage <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/unlocking-potential-blue-carbon-ecosystems-national-climate-policy\">blue carbon ecosystems</a> (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses). These ecosystems store and capture carbon at very high rates per unit area, while also supporting fisheries and coastal livelihoods, strengthening ecotourism and improving water quality. <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/BTR1_Colombia.pdf\">Colombia has approximately 285,000 hectares of mangroves</a> across its Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Despite its mitigation potential, in the NDC, mangroves are reflected only in the adaptation component, with measures focused largely on strengthening management and integrating ecosystem-based adaptation into marine and coastal protected areas, rather than setting explicit restoration or deforestation-reduction targets.</p><p>Encouragingly, Colombia is working to strengthen the technical basis for integrating blue carbon into its mitigation framework, starting by calculating the mitigation potential of mangroves and seagrasses. Expanding monitoring to better capture coastal and marine carbon dynamics could help unlock the full climate potential of these ecosystems.</p><h3>2) Navigating a Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels</h3><p>Although Colombia has a relatively clean electricity matrix, with hydropower accounting for <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/colombia/electricity\">almost 60% of total electricity generation in 2024</a>, its energy sector is the second-largest source of national  greenhouse gas emissions, representing <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/countries/COL?end_year=2022&start_year=1990#ghg-emissions\">31.5% of total emissions in 2022</a>. This is closely linked to the country’s long-standing <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/just-transitions-oil-gas-sector-workers-communities-middle-income-countries\">economic dependence on fossil fuel extraction</a>, which has historically been a pillar of the national economy and a significant source of export revenues. At the same time, Colombia remains reliant on fossil fuels across end-use sectors, particularly transport, industry and households, highlighting the need to accelerate electrification and energy efficiency beyond the power sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, Colombia’s heavy reliance on hydropower makes its electricity system <a href=\"https://es.wri.org/insights/adaptacion-climatica-del-sector-hidroelectrico-en-colombia-y-costa-rica-retos-y\">highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change</a>. In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/colombia/electricity\">35.7% of electricity generation came from fossil fuels</a>, an already significant share that can rise further during dry periods.  During <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/impacts-el-nino-beyond-water\">El Niño</a> events, reduced water availability forces increased reliance on coal- and gas-fired thermal power plants, resulting in sharp spikes in emissions. To address this vulnerability, Colombia’s NDC prioritizes the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind energy.</p><p>These efforts are complemented by the promotion of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/colombia-energy-communities-bring-electricity-income\">energy communities</a>, enabling local, rural and ethnic communities to generate and manage their own clean energy, as well as by commitments to modernize the electricity network both across the national grid and in non-interconnected areas. Likewise, the NDC includes energy efficiency measures to reduce emissions without compromising the reliability of electricity service. It also promotes demand-side measures such as hourly tariffs aimed at shifting electricity consumption away from peak hours, when carbon-intensive thermal generation is most active.</p><p>Finally, to address economic dependence on fossil fuels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/colombia-stop-new-oil-gas-exploration-davos\">Colombia has committed to halt the signing of new contracts for hydrocarbon exploration.</a> The NDC states that by 2029, the country will publish a definitive roadmap for exiting fossil fuels, outlining the technical, fiscal and labor transitions required to remove these fuels from the national energy matrix. This process is accompanied by the progressive dismantling of carbon-intensive fossil fuel subsidies and implementing a just labor transition strategy to provide social protection and create new <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/jobs-skills-new-economy-action-agenda\">green employment</a> opportunities for workers currently employed in the coal and oil sectors.</p><p>Colombia has also signaled internationally its commitment to accelerating the global transition away from fossil fuels. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/02/colombia-joins-international-alliance-calling-for-treaty-to-end-use-of-fossil-fuels\">The country has endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty</a>, becoming not only the first Latin American state to join the bloc, but also the largest fossil fuel producer to date to endorse the proposal. In April 2026, <a href=\"https://fossilfueltreaty.org/first-international-conference\">the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands</a> will jointly host the first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels. The announcement came at a critical political moment, as the 2025 COP30 final decision text did not include any explicit reference to fossil fuels — despite strong calls from countries for a global roadmap to guide a just transition away from them. The conference aims to help inform the COP30 Presidency as it develops its own transition roadmaps.</p><p>Despite these commitments, the political and economic reality of Colombia’s energy transition remains complex and uncertain. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/colombia-urges-world-to-quit-fossil-fuels-at-cop30-as-its-own-effort-lags\">Oil and coal continue to account for roughly half of the country’s export revenues</a>, underscoring its structural dependence on fossil fuels. Moreover, the decision to stop new hydrocarbon exploration contracts has had short-term implications for energy security: A domestic gas shortage in late 2025 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/colombian-companies-face-energy-crunch-as-gas-reserves-plunge\">forced Colombia to begin importing liquefied natural gas</a> to meet household and industrial demand, thereby increasing energy costs and exposing the system to international price volatility.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-16/colombia-warms-to-fossil-fuels-as-gustavo-petro-s-climate-agenda-fizzles\">Political dynamics</a> will further shape the outlook for the energy transition. With congressional elections scheduled for March 2026 and presidential elections in May 2026, the new leadership will be decisive in determining whether Colombia’s energy transition proceeds along an accelerated pathway or shifts towards a slower, more conservative trajectory. The current public debate includes proposals that would place greater emphasis on oil and gas within the national energy mix, while others would prioritize faster diversification. These election outcomes will therefore play a critical role in defining the credibility, pace and durability of the country’s long-term commitment to a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><h3>3) How Cities Are Driving the Climate Transition</h3><p>In Colombia, where <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-12/NDC%203.0%20Transformaciones%20para%20la%20Vida%20%28Colombia%29.pdf\">more than 76% of the population resides in urban areas</a>, cities have emerged as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/how-multilevel-action-advances-colombias-economic-transformation-and-climate-goals\">key laboratories for climate action</a>, developing innovative responses to climate risks that have inspired and informed global best practices. In Barranquilla, the <a href=\"https://prizeforcities.org/project/todos-al-parque\">Todos al Parque</a> (Everyone to the Park) program has transformed public space, ensuring that 93% of households have access to a green public space within an eight-minute walk. In Medellín, the implementation of <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/nature-positive-cities-tackle-extreme-heat/\">green corridors</a> has contributed to a reduction in average urban temperatures of up to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p>Meanwhile, Bogotá has advanced people-centred urban mobility through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/bogota-colombia-uses-data-and-smart-urban-design-cut-air-pollution\">Barrios Vitales</a> (Vital Neighbourhoods) initiative, introducing pedestrian-priority zones and reallocating road space from cars to active transport. In Bogotá’s San Felipe neighborhood, these interventions resulted in an 81% increase in public transportation use and an 82% rise in cycling and scooter use. Following implementation, the share of trips made on foot increased from 16% to 21%, contributing to lower traffic volumes and improved air quality, with initial monitoring showing a 13% reduction in PM2.5 concentrations.</p><p>Recognizing the role of cities in delivering climate action, Colombia endorsed the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships</a> (CHAMP) for Climate Action. This global initiative seeks to integrate subnational governments into the design of new NDCs and to strengthen the inclusion of subnational content within national climate plans. Through CHAMP, <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-subnational-governments-are-shaping-colombias-next-generation-climate-commitments/\">Colombia developed its 2025 NDC with the active participation of cities and communities</a>, committing to formally include subnational governments not only in climate planning processes but also in the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. As a result, the updated NDC incorporates a set of concrete urban mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"969\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1450\" />\n              <source height=\"842\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"645\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"508\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"304\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A person writes on a posterboard during a climate workshop.\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/champ-workshop-bogata_0.jpg?VersionId=Z7vhU3g4kjIu6vCtx0FKbMXmQPuuJrL9&itok=MIQ4vA4G\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>During a CHAMP workshop in Bogotá, participants had the opportunity to incorporate subnational perspectives into Colombia's new NDC. Photo by WRI Colombia.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>By 2030, the country aims to have 600,000 electric vehicles, including taxis, public passenger transport, light-duty vehicles, light trucks and official government fleets. Achieving this target will require the large-scale deployment of charging infrastructure in major cities, intermediate municipalities and key logistics corridors as well as the incorporation of electric mobility targets into subnational development plans. Likewise, Colombia commits to increasing the modal share of active transport by 5.5% in participating cities by promoting walking and cycling.</p><p>The NDC promotes the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/zerb-accelerator-2025-progress-colombia-kenya-philippines\">decarbonization of the building and construction sector</a> by reducing natural gas and electricity consumption in new residential and commercial buildings. Complementing these efforts, it promotes the adoption of thermal districts as a centralized solution for urban cooling, replacing inefficient individual air-conditioning systems with lower-emission alternatives. The country has set clear milestones for this measure, targeting the implementation of eight thermal districts in several cities by 2030, 12 districts accumulated by 2035 and 15 districts nationwide by 2040, with increasing mitigation potential over time.</p><p>Colombia’s NDC also includes a specific commitment to reduce black carbon emissions, recognizing its dual role as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/short-lived-climate-pollutant-reductions\">a short-lived climate pollutant</a> and a major contributor to air pollution in urban areas. The country has set a target to reduce black carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2014 levels, equivalent to an estimated reduction of approximately 6,130 metric tons. By 2035, Colombia aims to reduce black carbon emissions by 6,130 metric tons to 8,873 metric tons, compared to 2014 emissions, excluding those from forest fires.</p><h3>The Decisive Years Ahead</h3><p>Looking ahead, Colombia’s climate trajectory will be shaped decisively by domestic political choices. The direction taken by the next administration will be crucial in determining whether the country’s climate ambitions are sustained, implemented, slowed or reversed. The next four years will be particularly decisive, as they coincide with the implementation window for meeting Colombia’s NDC 2030 targets across all sectors, including those highlighted in this analysis.</p><p>Ultimately, if Colombia seeks to maintain its role as an international leader on climate action, particularly among emerging economies, its ability to deliver on the commitments set out in its NDC will be a key test of credibility.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Recent moves by the Trump administration are prolonging America’s farewell to coal plants.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has issued a slate of orders in recent months compelling coal plants in multiple states to continue running past their planned closure dates.</p><p>The administration also reinstated the National Coal Council (NCC), a committee which advises on federal coal policy and whose charter had expired in 2021. At its first meeting following the renewal, held <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-convenes-first-national-coal-council-meeting-under-renewed-charter\">on January 15</a>, the NCC announced that it will be chaired by the CEO of coal producer Peabody Energy.</p><p>This follows a series of actions by federal agencies aimed at propping up the country’s coal industry. Last fall, DOE announced <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-625-million-investment-reinvigorate-and-expand-americas-coal\">$625 million</a> in funding aimed at retrofitting and recommissioning aging coal plants to extend their lifespans. The same week, the Department of the Interior said it would open <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-unleashes-american-coal-power-bold-move-advance-trump-administration\">13.1 million acres</a> of federal land to coal mining. And the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-repeal-biden-harris-epa-regulations-power-plants-which-if-finalized-would\">proposed</a> weakening regulations meant to limit toxic water and air pollution from coal plants.</p><p>These moves are intended to shore up U.S. power supply in the face of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/whats-driving-us-electricity-prices\">rising energy costs</a>, reliability concerns and growing energy demand (not least from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">new data centers</a>).</p><p>Yet, coal is not an economical answer to energy security. Evidence shows that keeping old plants online, which sometimes means recommissioning broken-down units, <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies_Cost-of-Federal-Mandates-to-Retain-Fossil-Burning-Power-Plants.pdf#page=6\">is costing utilities millions</a> — costs that are passed onto ratepayers. While these plants might bolster power supply in the short term, they are already driving up electricity bills. And they will hurt Americans' health and accelerate dangerous climate change.</p><p>The good news is that there are cleaner, more reliable sources available today that can meet the country's rising demand more affordably.</p><h3>Coal Has Declined as Cheaper, Cleaner Power Sources Emerged</h3><p>Two decades ago, nearly half the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,0,1&fuel=vtvv&geo=g&sec=g&linechart=ELEC.GEN.GEO-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.TSN-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.BIO-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.SUN-US-99.A&columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A&map=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A&freq=A&start=2005&end=2024&chartindexed=0&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&columnvalues=0&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0\">United States</a>' electricity came from coal. Today, only about 15% does.</p><p>The single biggest reason for this shift is that other power sources became more competitive. <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/the_effect_of_fuel_prices_environmental_regulations_and_other_factors_on_u.s._coal_productions_2008-2016.pdf\">Natural gas prices fell</a> relative to coal as the U.S. ramped up shale gas production, making coal plants less economic. This helped accelerate momentum <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/what-killing-us-coal-industry\">away from coal and toward natural gas</a> around the early 2010s. Protective environmental and climate regulations have also made it more expensive to operate highly polluting coal plants.</p><p>In tandem, plummeting renewable prices over the last decade and state policies encouraging adoption led to rapid clean energy deployment.

An April executive order directed DOE to evaluate processes for using its emergency powers to improve grid reliability. As a result of this order, the agency has taken action to keep fossil fuel plants slated for retirement in operation, targeting coal plants in Michigan, <a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2025/12/31/craig-station-emergency-order-coal-power-colorado-trump/\">Colorado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-admin-orders-washington-state-coal-plant-to-stay-running\">Washington state</a>, <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-indiana-coal-nipsco-centerpoint-emergency-order/808660/\">Indiana</a> and elsewhere.</p><p>These measures come at a steep price. With spending needed on retrofits and upgrades, the cost of coal power is rising as aging plants become more expensive to operate and maintain. This means that keeping old plants open can be costly.</p><p>In May 2025, DOE ordered utility Consumers Energy to continue operating the JH Campbell coal plant in Michigan, which was just about to retire. In August, the administration <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/media/trump-administration-illegally-extends-michigan-coal-plant-third-time-despite-staggering\">issued a second order</a> forcing the plant to run for another 90 days. In late October, Consumers Energy reported that the DOE’s orders had <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31102025/michigan-campbell-coal-plant-operation-has-cost-80-million/\">resulted in an $80 million loss</a> thus far — and confirmed that costs associated with this loss would be passed through to Michigan ratepayers. The administration <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/media/trump-administration-illegally-extends-michigan-coal-plant-third-time-despite-staggering\">issued a third order</a> in November forcing JH Campbell to continue running for another 90 days.</p><p>Similarly, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-coal-plant-electricity-craig-64eab6db7145003c1b7c7bc7584ec7b9\">Colorado plant</a> targeted by a DOE stay-open order at the end of December had been offline since earlier that month due to a mechanical failure. Complying with DOE’s order to keep running for the next 90 days is estimated to cost ratepayers an <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/grid-strategies_craig-unit-1-report.pdf\">additional $20 million</a>.</p><p>Continuing to keep these plants operating — so far, the Trump administration has not let any of its 90-day orders lapse for targeted coal plants — will spell further rate hikes for consumers. This will only exacerbate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/16/nx-s1-5502671/electricity-bill-high-inflation-ai\">surging power bills</a> for U.S. households and businesses. One recent report estimates that efforts to prevent large fossil fuel power plants from retiring could <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/document/report-the-cost-of-federal-mandates-to-retain-fossil-burning-power-plants\">cost ratepayers about $3.1 billion a year</a> by the end of 2028.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25546913/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>There Are Better Ways to Meet US Power Demand</h3><p>More coal is not the answer to today's energy challenges. What the U.S. needs to keep prices down, meet rising demand and stay competitive on a global scale is: 1) to build wind, solar and batteries rapidly now, because they are the quickest to install and least expensive source of energy in many regions; and 2) to scale up clean, firm power — a variety of low-carbon sources, including next-generation geothermal, nuclear and hydropower, that can operate around the clock.</p><p>Investing in clean energy today makes good financial sense. The cost of building new renewables <a href=\"https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus-lcoeplus/\">can be less than the cost of just <em>operating</em> coal plants</a>. Indeed, research has shown that the majority of U.S. coal plants would be <a href=\"https://energyinnovation.org/report/the-coal-cost-crossover-3-0/\">more expensive to continue running</a> than to replace with local wind or solar. Scaling these sources will also be key to supporting the administration's goal of \"energy dominance\" in a world that's <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2025/executive-summary\">increasingly investing in renewables</a>.</p><p>Despite current headwinds, including the early phase-out of key federal tax credits, U.S. wind and solar are still expected to grow in the coming years. In its latest <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-july-2025\">energy infrastructure report</a>, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forecasts that the U.S. will add 92.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar and 22.6 GW of new wind between August 2025 and July 2028 — enough to power more than 25 million homes. It also forecasts that no new coal will be built over this period, while 25 GW of existing coal capacity and 13.7 GW of natural gas capacity are set to retire.</p><p>Several offshore wind projects are also moving ahead despite efforts to halt them. On December 22, the Trump administration issued “stop-work” orders to all five offshore wind projects currently under construction in the U.S., citing national security risks. However, in January, federal judges found that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5709209-fourth-wind-farm-blocked-by-trump-is-allowed-to-resume-construction/\">four of the administration’s orders were unsubstantiated</a> and lifted them, allowing construction to resume. (The fifth is still being decided, as of late January.) Another judge suspended the federal freeze on approvals of new offshore wind projects.</p><p>There are also opportunities to ramp up investment in clean power sources beyond wind and solar and to increase the efficiency of the grid. Technologies such as nuclear and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/next-generation-geothermal-energy-explained\">advanced geothermal</a> already benefit from bipartisan support in Congress and could potentially represent a significant percentage of the country's future energy mix. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/advanced-transmission-technologies-us-power-grid\">new transmission technologies</a> can modernize the aging grid and increase its efficiency, helping to move more power along existing lines and accommodate rapidly growing demand. The country can also increase investments in demand response, virtual power plants, managed charging, and other forms of shifting demand from peak periods. These are lower cost options to meet demand while reducing the amount of new generation and transmission that we need to build.</p><p>Now is the time to make smart, forward-looking investments in energy that's safe, affordable, reliable and abundant — rather than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/10/07/white-house-fossil-fuel-concierge/\">clinging to systems of the past</a> that will raise costs for consumers.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published on Oct. 14, 2025.

      "description": "<p>As we enter a new year, people around the world are grappling with <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339214/global-affordability-crisis-cost-of-living-inflation-politics/\">rising costs</a> for housing, energy and food. Most <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/08/19/global-economic-conditions-as-a-threat/\">worry</a> about the state of the economy. Job prospects feel uncertain in the face of widespread AI, automation and other disruptions.</p><p>These concerns have eclipsed climate action <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/rebranding-climate-action\">at the polls</a> and in political discourse, especially in wealthier countries. Vigorous debate around climate policies in the EU and backpedaling in the United States reflect a common belief that tackling climate change will make day-to-day economic struggles worse.</p><p>Yet at the same time, a growing group of countries see climate action as one of the best tools to improve lives and strengthen economies. Take Pakistan, where <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/pakistan-solar-energy-boom\">cheap, dependable solar</a> has slashed power costs for households and businesses. Or Brazil, where <a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/noticias/brasil-restauracao-planaveg-34-milhoes-hectares\">land restoration</a> is creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in rural areas and Indigenous communities. Around <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/raising-ambition/renewable-energy\">35 million people</a> now work in clean energy globally, outstripping fossil fuel employment.</p><p><strong>Today, the question is no longer </strong><em><strong>whether</strong></em><strong> the world will transition to a low-carbon future, but </strong><em><strong>how</strong></em><strong> it will happen. Who pays, who benefits, and who gets left behind?</strong></p><p>Each year, WRI identifies the major moments, issues and decisions that we believe will shape the world's trajectory. This year's Stories to Watch are not about climate and biodiversity targets that will come due decades from now. They're about the choices countries are making to address climate change and economic challenges right now. They’re about how we can — and must — improve people’s lives <em>today</em>.</p><article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNUKou0gFxE\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch Stories to Watch 2026\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>1) Growth: Can Climate Action Power a New Era of Prosperity?</h3><p>A persistent argument against climate action has been that it will slow economic growth. Last December, for example, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk78y7k8ezo\">watered down its landmark plan</a> to ban petrol and diesel car production by 2035, giving into the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-yields-pressure-automakers-it-rethinks-2035-combustion-car-ban-2025-12-15/\">German and Italian governments’ fears</a> that it would harm their auto industries.</p><p>However, it is also possible that delaying the electric vehicle transition risks Europe’s long-term competitiveness and growth. </p><p>Leading experts say that low-carbon growth can help economies expand faster than business as usual. In China, for example, clean energy now contributes <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-clean-energy-contributed-a-record-10-of-chinas-gdp-in-2024/\">over 10% of GDP</a> — $1.9 trillion in 2024. Thanks to early investments and government support, the country dominates global markets for solar panels, electric vehicles and other clean technologies, markets that are expected to <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-transport/global-electric-vehicle-sales-set-for-record-breaking-year-even-as-us-market-slows-sharply-bloombergnef-finds/#:~:text=In%20the%20base%20case%20Economic,73%25%20in%20the%20previous%20outlook.\">grow significantly in the coming decade</a>.</p><p>Overall, a <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-investing-planetary-health-would-deliver-higher-gdp-fewer\">UN report</a> finds that the world could produce an additional $20 trillion in economic benefits per year by 2070 by investing in clean energy, resilient food systems and other climate solutions.</p><p>But it’s not just about the money.</p><p>Inclusive, low-carbon growth could reduce poverty and connect households to reliable, affordable power. Reduced air pollution alone can avoid <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-investing-planetary-health-would-deliver-higher-gdp-fewer\">9 million</a> premature deaths by 2050. All of this has knock-on effects for economies.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive-diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27376671/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Reaping these benefits means being intentional about <em>how</em> growth happens.</p><p>The Kenyan government, for instance, has zeroed in on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/electrifying-kenyas-two-and-three-wheelers\">electrifying two- and three-wheelers</a>. Millions rely on these vehicles to get around and earn a living as taxi or delivery drivers, but fuel costs can <a href=\"https://energyalliance.org/kenya-boda-boda-drivers-electric-motorcycles/\">swallow up to half their daily earnings</a>. These efforts are not just putting money back into peoples’ pockets, but deliberately boosting the local economy from the bottom up.</p><p>On the corporate side, IKEA, the world’s largest furniture retailer, is proving that sustainability can go hand-in-hand with growth. Using its resources more efficiently and investing in clean energy, the company has <a href=\"https://www.ingka.com/newsroom/ingka-group-reporting-reduction-in-climate-footprint-by-30-1-while-growing-the-business/\">reduced its climate footprint 30%</a> since 2016. It increased revenue by nearly 24% over the same period.</p><p>But we need to see much more of this across the board.</p><p><strong>What to watch this year:</strong></p><ul><li>With evidence that it is possible to deliberately grow and decarbonize at the same time, even today, leaders like Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have championed <a href=\"https://unsdg.un.org/latest/announcements/seizing-rare-opportunity-green-growth-un-deputy-chief-calls-leadership-and\">green policies and investments</a> as <em>the</em> growth opportunity for the next decade. <strong>Will more countries set long-term development plans that deliver for people, nature and climate?</strong></li><li>Last year’s UN climate summit (COP30) saw the establishment of 13 new <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\">country platforms</a>, bringing together all sources of finance at the country level with specific investment plans. <strong>Will more countries align finance behind their low-carbon transition priorities?</strong></li><li>Today, the <a href=\"https://stegra.com/the-boden-plant\">world’s most electrified steel mill</a> is under construction in Sweden. The project has secured <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/swedens-stegra-seeks-more-funds-green-steel-project-business-daily-di-reports-2025-09-04/\">$7 billion dollars</a> in financing, aiming to disrupt a massive market. <strong>Will we continue to see major investments in clean industrialization?</strong></li><li>Any economic transition needs vast innovation and entrepreneurship in every sector. Emerging economies like <a href=\"https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1727605/viet-nam-issues-legal-framework-for-national-and-local-venture-capital-funds.html\">Vietnam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wastex.io/post/biochar-significantly-improves-yields-of-cauliflower-and-bitter-gourd-in-central-java-indonesia\">Indonesia</a> and <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/ttclear/misc_/StaticFiles/gnwoerk_static/TEC_NSI/37cd8b96633a4ef2b6b0d10c21f06dec/86c19182d6b4408ab8900222c8bda673.pdf\">Kenya</a> that aim to become high-income economies by 2045 are investing in local green innovation to reach their goals. <strong>Will more countries nurture local green innovation?</strong></li></ul><h3>2) Affordability: Will Climate Solutions Lower Everyday Costs?</h3><p>Prices have increased noticeably around the world. People are paying more for groceries, electric bills, transportation and other basic necessities.</p><p>From the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/nyregion/kathy-hochul-new-york-climate-issues.html\">state of New York</a> to countries like <a href=\"https://energynews.africa/2026/01/07/gas-is-the-new-gold-how-africa-is-rebranding-fossil-fuels-as-a-transition-weapon/\">Nigeria and Senegal</a>, leaders are citing affordability as a reason to continue investing in fossil fuels in the face of rising energy demand.</p><p>Yet renewable power is now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/around-90-renewables-cheaper-than-fossil-fuels-worldwide-irena-says-2025-07-22/\">cheaper to build and operate than fossil fuel plants</a> almost everywhere. With costs continuing to fall around the world, countries that choose to invest in scaling up clean energy have an opportunity to translate these long-term savings to <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/renewables-consumer-energy-revolution/\">lower power bills for consumers</a>.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27320251/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>While energy is often at the center of affordability and climate discussions, housing itself is generally the largest household expense. People don’t usually connect housing to climate change, but buildings account for <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/themes/climate-change/40-of-emissions-come-from-real-estate-heres-how-the-sector-can-decarbonize/\">40% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Families can also be at higher risk from climate impacts like floods, fires and storms depending on the location and condition of their homes. One in three people globally live in substandard housing or informal settlements, leaving them highly exposed.</p><p>In Brazil, where more than more than 16 million people live in informal settlements, the government is working with residents to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/upgrading-informal-settlements-brazils-urban-periphery\">co-create neighborhoods</a> with safer housing and better access to basic services, transportation networks and jobs. Their solution isn’t building new homes somewhere else, but upgrading the places where people already live.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27320239/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>It may be more costly upfront to ensure energy efficient and climate-resilient housing, but it helps families and governments save money in the long run. More leaders need to start thinking about how to address climate and affordability together.</p><p><strong>What to watch this year:</strong></p><ul><li>This May, housing will be the focus of the <a href=\"https://wuf.unhabitat.org/wuf13\">World Urban Forum in Baku</a>, one of the biggest gatherings of urban leaders. <strong>Will housing, one of our biggest affordability problems, also be understood as a climate challenge?</strong></li><li>Solar adoption is reaching tipping points in countries like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/pakistan-solar-energy-boom\">Pakistan</a> and <a href=\"https://globalpi.org/research/south-africas-solar-boom\">South Africa</a>, where it is an alternative to grid electricity. <strong>As prices continue to drop, will cheap renewables reach a tipping point in more countries?</strong></li><li>Energy demand is rising across the world thanks to trends like increasing electrification, more need for cooling, and economic growth. <strong>How will countries meet this growing demand affordably? How much will come from renewables and other low-carbon sources?</strong></li><li>Trade was a hot topic last year, and countries agreed to discuss trade at the UN climate negotiations for the first time. <strong>Will new trade rules, such as the</strong> <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en\"><strong>EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</strong></a><strong>, encourage or stifle green growth?</strong></li></ul><h3>3) Jobs: Will Workers Benefit from a Clean Economy?</h3><p>The deepest concern in any economic transition is jobs. Few things are scarier than losing a job. It’s not just the loss of income, but the threat to our sense of identity and a family’s future.</p><p>Coal is a classic example of climate-related job loss. Other sectors beyond energy, like manufacturing, construction and agriculture, will also be impacted.</p><p>All told, however, the transition is expected to create more jobs than it eliminates across the economy. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/jobs-skills-new-economy-action-agenda\">Recent research</a> shows that shifts across five key economic sectors could lead to a net <em>gain</em> of around 375 million jobs over the next 10 years.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive-diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27378868/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Around 630 million jobs, representing 18% of the global workforce, will be impacted by the low-carbon transition. There are real risks that people will remain out of work if it isn’t properly managed.</p><p>Leaders need to be proactive in preparing people for these changes. This means investing in reskilling and upskilling programs and designing thoughtful transition plans that put workers first.</p><p>In India — a major supplier of car components globally — it’s estimated that <a href=\"https://www.context.news/just-transition/indian-auto-parts-makers-face-job-losses-as-evs-rev-up\">one in three auto workers</a> will be affected by the transition toward electric vehicles. However, many car components are supplied by smaller businesses that operate on thin margins and cannot afford to invest in training programs. To help close the gap, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-resilient-supply-chains-crest/india-resilient-inclusive-sustainable-enterprises\">industry associations, technical experts and supply chain partners</a> are coming together, supporting workers through the transition and opening up pathways for women into manufacturing, an area long dominated by men.</p><p>Reskilling is a top priority in all sectors, but such programs are relatively nascent around the world. Truly supporting workers will require more effort and investment — not just from governments, but also companies, unions, schools and other training providers.</p><p><strong>What to watch this year:</strong></p><ul><li>LinkedIn data shows that demand for sustainability-related skills is <a href=\"https://sustainabilitymag.com/news/demand-for-green-skills-is-outstripping-supply-twice-over\">growing almost twice as fast</a> as the supply of qualified workers. <strong>Will companies hardwire skills training into corporate low-carbon transition planning?</strong></li><li>Only half of countries include explicit plans to address workforce needs in their <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/assessing-2025-ndcs\">recent climate commitments</a>. And just 1% laid out measures to finance these policies. <strong>Will governments at all scales start planning and investing more intentionally in workforce development?</strong></li><li>AI has been all over the news for its potential impact on jobs, a disruption that is happening at the same time countries are transitioning to a new economy. <strong>How will AI impact jobs for the new economy in 2026?</strong></li></ul><h3>Building Stronger Communities Today</h3><p>Evidence from across the world shows that this economic transition will not happen at the speed and scale necessary unless people are at the center.</p><p>Families around the world are focused on how they will make a living, how they will pay their bills, and whether they feel secure and optimistic about the future.</p><p>Though the transition is inevitable, it will not automatically be good or bad for growth, affordability or jobs. That will depend on decisions we make.</p><p>Choices exist today for governments, businesses and communities to make the transition good for people and the planet at the same time. These choices also exist for each one of us in 2026.</p>",

Accurate monitoring of these resources over time may enable communities to make better land management decisions that benefit both climate and people simultaneously.</p><p>Many communities in the U.S. are developing Climate Action Plans (CAPs) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. While many CAPs focus on the energy, transportation and waste sectors, most do not consider the role forests and trees play in the fight against climate change. One reason is that planners have lacked the data and clear guidance needed to include them in GHG inventories, on which CAPs are based.</p><p>To address this gap, experts from WRI, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI USA) <a href=\"https://us-protocol.pubpub.org/pub/v732gbdy/release/1\">published guidance</a> for ICLEI USA’s <a href=\"https://icleiusa.org/us-community-protocol/\">U.S. Community Protocol</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/greenhouse-gas-protocol-accounting-reporting-standard-cities\">Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories</a>. These frameworks outline how to estimate emissions from forest and tree cover loss within communities, as well as carbon absorbed by forests and trees that are maintained or newly planted by a community.</p><h3>Introducing the Land Emissions and Removals Navigator (LEARN)</h3><p>Accompanying this guidance is the <a href=\"https://icleiusa.org/LEARN/\">Land Emissions and Removals Navigator (LEARN) tool</a>, developed in collaboration with web developer <a href=\"https://www.blueraster.com/\">Blue Raster</a>.

After specifying an area and years to analyze, LEARN does the rest by performing automated, spatially explicit analyses of data from the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Geological Survey, including:</p><ul><li>Land cover change</li><li>Timing and location of forest disturbances like fire, harvest and insect outbreaks</li><li>Loss and gain of tree canopy cover in urban and other non-forested lands</li><li>Carbon stocks within forests of different maturity classes and protection statuses</li></ul><p>(<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/hundreds-us-communities-are-making-climate-action-plans-few-include-forests\">Read more</a> about the <a href=\"https://www.woodwellclimate.org/us-communities-learn-the-carbon-value-of-their-trees/\">history and development</a> of the LEARN tool, and read about the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/learn-tool-land-emissions-and-removals-navigator-technical-note?auHash=Y1Vzg7r9myssUQkcCW2sfB_RlsXpl3LmgRmTNAidSH8\">data and methodology here</a>.)</p><h3>Training Cohorts Bring Support Directly to Communities</h3><p>Following a first successful <a href=\"https://icleiusa.org/forest-trees-carbon-accounting-2020-training-cohort/\">Forests & Trees Carbon Accounting Cohort Training Session</a> in 2021, in July 2022, the LEARN project team launched a second training cohort to guide 20 communities in implementing the U.S. Community Protocol methods and using the LEARN tool. Participants represented municipal governments, tribes and states from across the country. In 2023, a third cohort was convened to support communities in integrating local, high-resolution data sets into analyses. This cohort also piloted the use of “plantable areas” analyses to help communities estimate potential impacts of tree planting initiatives.</p><h3>LEARN’s Capabilities Expand Further in 2025</h3><p>In 2025, LEARN integrated the most up-to-date NLCD data for land cover and tree canopy, spanning 20 years of land cover change (2001-2021) and more than a decade of tree canopy change (2011-2019).</p><p>Additionally, higher resolution (30-meter) maps of forest carbon pools and forest characteristics data like forest type and age class from the <a href=\"https://research.fs.usda.gov/srs/news/highlights/processing-forest-inventory-data-182-million-pixels-second\">USFS BIGMAP</a> project replaced the older 250-meter data sets, allowing for more precise calculations of carbon fluxes. Automated analyses now include additional insights on <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.979528/full\">forest maturity</a>, protection status and carbon stocks within maturity and protection groups.</p><p>Finally, another new feature allows users to input custom emission and removal factors, enabling users to tailor the tool’s default calculations to specific local conditions.</p><h3>New Updates in 2026 Improve LEARN’s Accessibility</h3><p>In January 2026, in partnership with Crosswalk Labs, the LEARN team completed the integration of land sector GHG flux insights into the <a href=\"https://www.crosswalk.io/\">Crosswalk platform</a>, a tool that provides a comprehensive emissions and energy consumption data set across all 50 U.S. states to support local, state and federal decision-makers. This integration expands access to forest- and tree-related emissions and removals estimates by making these land-sector insights available alongside other community-scale climate data used for planning and decision-making.</p><h3>Next Steps for LEARN and GHG Monitoring for Forests and Trees</h3><p>The LEARN tool has established itself as a trustworthy and easy-to-use tool to support communities in estimating GHG fluxes from the land sector.</p><p>LEARN has been added by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to its Technical Assistance Forum Resource Library to help support Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) recipients across the country. Building on growing user engagement, WRI and partners will continue expanding LEARN’s reach to stakeholders and broader geographic scales. As of January 2026, this work includes the completed Crosswalk platform integration, which broadens access to this data for climate action efforts nationwide.WRI and partners are continuing to seek input from stakeholders across the U.S. and around the world on how these methods may best be scaled across geographies, governments and technical capacities. In the future, this kind of data will be available for communities around the world, not just in the U.S. — <a href=\"https://landcarbonlab.org/insights/land-carbon-lab-monitoring-greenhouse-gas-impacts/\">read more here</a> about upcoming developments in monitoring GHGs for forests and land worldwide.</p><p>For questions or to learn more, reach out to <a href=\"mailto:erin.glen@wri.org\">erin.glen@wri.org</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The United States faces a pressing energy challenge: how to ensure people have reliable and affordable electricity when deadly storms hit.</p><p>This need came into sharp focus last weekend when a powerful winter storm swept across <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3z8ek7eqyo\">Texas up to Maine</a>, bringing with it heavy snowfall, freezing rain and subzero temperatures. It caused blackouts to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/winter-storm-electric-grid-overdrive-00745690\">more than 1 million customers</a>, especially in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. Many are still without power.</p><p>Preparations made by utilities and grid operators — including staging extra line crews, positioning equipment in high-risk areas and ensuring backup generation and reserves were on standby — certainly helped prevent further widespread outages during Winter Storm Fern. The bigger challenge now is long-term: reducing the number of blackouts by making power systems more reliable and still affordable in winter storms, and extreme weather in general.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><table class=\"table\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding: 0; width: 75px;\"><img alt=\"Profile photo.\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/220px/s3/2025-08/kelly-lefler_0.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 100%; display: inline; width: 75px;\" /></td><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/kelly-lefler\"><em><span style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\"><strong>Kelly Lefler</strong></span></em></a><em><span style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">, Senior Manager, Grid Decarbonization and Markets, WRI U.S. Polsky Energy Center</span></em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/kelly-lefler\">WRI energy expert Kelly Lefler</a> outlines what’s needed to strengthen the reliability of the electricity system and ensure people can count on constant, affordable power in the face of increasingly erratic weather. </p><h4>What is mostly behind the power outages during Winter Storm Fern?</h4><p>Utilities and regulators will assess records and publish official reports of what happened in the coming weeks and months, but for now it seems that the outages were largely due to the icy conditions affecting distribution and transmission systems. Ice from the storm built up on trees and the added weight caused them to snap, toppling power lines. The ice can also build up on the lines themselves and bring them down.</p><p>Also, in eastern U.S., some power plants couldn’t produce as much electricity because of the extreme cold and limited natural gas supplies, forcing them to shut down or run at reduced capacity. The region relies on natural gas pipelines along the East Coast, which are historically constrained during very cold weather. As a result, there were nearly 21 gigawatts of generation outages, with most of that capacity forced offline. To put that into perspective, 21 gigawatts (that's 21 billion watts) is enough to power millions of homes at the same time. Importantly, these disruptions did not require grid operators to impose rolling blackouts to prevent larger system failures.</p><h4>What makes the US electricity system vulnerable to winter storms and extreme cold? </h4><p>Winter storms tend to stress the electricity system — from power plants to transmission lines and distribution networks — in predictable ways that create an imbalance between supply and demand of electricity or make it harder to maintain safe grid conditions. When that happens, grid operators may be forced to take some electricity demand offline to prevent a larger, uncontrolled outage. While every major winter blackout has its own story, a few common failure points show up again and again.</p><p>In extreme cold, one of the biggest challenges is getting fuel to power plants for electricity generation and to homes for heating. Natural gas is the U.S.’s largest source of electricity generation, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61444#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20is%20the%20single,fired%20power%20plants%20vary%20significantly.\">providing 43% of electricity as of 2024</a>. During winter storms, demand for natural gas spikes as people turn up thermostats, while power plants also need the fuel to generate electricity. This simultaneous surge, known as coincident peak, is a well-known planning challenge. Extreme cold can strain the natural gas system beyond normal operating conditions, making it harder for gas-powered generators to access fuel when they need it the most. Similar stress can happen during extreme heat, when air conditioners drive up electricity demand.</p><p>Another issue is lack of proper winterization — preparing equipment for wintry conditions — across different parts of the electricity system. Equipment that isn’t prepared for extreme cold, such as power plants, sensors and natural gas wells and pipelines, can freeze or malfunction. When multiple pieces fail at once, utilities may have no choice but to implement widespread outages to maintain system safety and prevent cascading failures. </p><p>Winter conditions also make it harder for crews to maintain or repair equipment as problems arise, increasing the risk of outages.</p><p>Transmission and distribution systems can also be affected by winter storms. Ice and heavy snow can damage power lines, reduce their carrying capacity or cause mechanical problems, making it harder to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed — even when enough power is available. These lines are especially vulnerable without regular maintenance. For example, trimming trees near power lines is critical to prevent ice-laden branches from falling on them, as has happened during Winter Storm Fern. </p>\n\n      \n\n    \n    \n<div class=\"embedded-entity embed--block-type--in-this-series has-border-background-color\">\n      <h3 class=\"embed-block__title\">Related</h3>\n  \n  \n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-featured-items field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/energy\" hreflang=\"en\">Energy</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/grid-interconnection-for-energy-security\" hreflang=\"en\">Sharing Electricity Across Borders Could Bolster Energy Security</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            February 25, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Workers on a power transmission tower overlooking a river.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2025-02/china-ultra-high-voltage-transmission.jpg?VersionId=jAItqS.Fubc0hBDSySxxlbAoVLdyKcSU&h=41f55a5b&itok=EXQPwJNf\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/energy\" hreflang=\"en\">Energy</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/advanced-transmission-technologies-us-power-grid\" hreflang=\"en\">How Advanced Transmission Technologies Can Revamp the Aging US Power Grid</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            July 10, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"An electrician fixes a high-voltage transmission line above a traffic light.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2025-07/advanced-transmission-technologies.jpg?VersionId=eEMAehdOlg1HilwauMI9e5nsNeXeRd1a&h=fd5bd395&itok=k7SpoHhr\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n<h4>How can energy systems be made more reliable and affordable during weather shocks? </h4><p>There are several ways that energy systems can be made more reliable ahead of winter storms and extreme weather. Greater reliability helps prevent supply disruptions, eases pressure during peak demand periods and can keep power more affordable. </p><p>One of the key ways to make energy systems more reliable is by maximizing flexibility — improving how well the system can adapt in real time to changes in supply and demand. The more flexible the system, the better it can handle sudden demand spikes in the event of extreme weather, such as cold snaps or heat waves, or respond to supply disruptions such as plant outages.</p><p>Improving flexibility includes upgrading aging infrastructure. Much of the U.S. grid was built decades ago under different demand patterns. Modernizing the grid — by updating substations and transmission equipment, deploying advanced sensors and incorporating advanced transmission technologies (ATTs), for example — can reduce failure rates during extreme heat and cold. These technologies help operators detect problems quicker, reroute power if equipment is damaged and restore service fast. Modernization not only improves reliability but also reduces expensive emergency interventions and lowers long-term maintenance costs. </p><p>Increasing grid capacity, both through deployment of ATTs and building regional and interregional transmission lines, can reduce the risk of a local weather event turning into a widespread outage. Creating a more interconnected grid allows regions to share power during shortages. Having this greater transmission capacity also help keep prices down by allowing lower-cost electricity to reach areas facing higher demand. </p><p>Demand-side management options can help ease pressure on the system during extreme weather events. These include encouraging customers and large users to reduce or shift electricity use during peak periods in exchange for lower bills or leveraging distributed energy resources to help prevent shortages.</p><p>Systems that rely too much on a single fuel are more vulnerable to disruption. Diversification across energy sources and technologies helps reduce the risk of issues related to fuel shortages, infrastructure failures and localized weather impacts. </p><p>Finally, policy is also critical. It’s vital that incentives are properly aligned with modern needs for flexibility and preparedness. This can help utilities make system investments that really work in extreme weather and minimize costs to consumers in both the short and the long run. </p><h4>What role, if any, can clean energy play? </h4><p>While renewables are weather-dependent, broad geographic dispersion and forecasting allow them to <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/grid/extreme-weather-events\">contribute meaningfully during winter storms</a>. Wind and solar generation tend to be available during many extreme cold events, even when other resources are strained.  </p><p>In several recent cold-weather events, renewable generation was available when needed, even as some fossil fuel units were forced offline because of freezing equipment or fuel supply constraints. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-nerc-release-final-report-lessons-winter-storm-elliott\">during Winter Storm Elliott, only 7% of unavailable generating capacity</a> came from clean energy resources — that’s wind, solar, nuclear and hydro combined. And in some parts within the impacted region, wind and solar exceeded forecasts. </p><p>Clean energy also supports diversification. Adding a broader mix of energy sources reduces dependence on a single fuel or delivery system that may be disrupted during extreme weather. Resources that do not rely on “just-in-time\" fuel delivery, in which power plants receive fuel only when it is needed, can reduce exposure to fuel shortages when supply chains are strained. </p>",

      "description": "<p>In the southern Brazilian Amazon, seed collectors carefully search the forest floor. They move among the trees, mindful not to harm surrounding plants as they bend and crouch to gather native seeds from the soil and fallen fruit.</p><p>They are part of the <a href=\"https://www.sementesdoxingu.org.br/\">Xingu Seeds Network (ARSX)</a>, an association in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso that brings together about 700 Amazonian seed collectors. Launched in 2007 by the Instituto Socioambiental (Socio-Environmental Institute, or ISA) and Indigenous leaders, the network helps locals sell seeds to organizations and landowners, who use them in forest restoration projects.</p><p>So far, nearly 1,000 families from more than 100 Indigenous villages and local communities have taken part in the initiative. They have gathered seeds from over 220 species, generated over 8.5 million reais ($1.7 million) in income and contributed to the restoration of 27 million trees on 11,000 hectares of previously degraded land. More than 390 metric tons of native seeds have been sold so far, setting an unprecedented record in the Amazon.</p><p>It is a prime example of how an “Indigenous bioeconomy” — developed and sustained by Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities in the Amazon — can provide economic opportunities while also preserving biological, cultural and social diversity.</p><p>“[ARSX has] shown Brazil and the world that it is possible to give value to a standing forest,” said Rodrigo Junqueira, executive secretary of ISA. “[It] has demonstrated that it is possible to price seeds and develop an economy around them without excluding people or stakeholders from the process.”</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Defining Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities</strong></p><p><strong>Indigenous peoples</strong> are ethnic groups with a history of settlement in the Americas dating back roughly 10,000 to 15,000 years. They have their own languages, political and governance systems, justice structures and distinct approaches to territorial management and stewardship.</p><p>As recognized by <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/mma/pt-br/assuntos/povos-e-comunidades-tradicionais/povos-e-comunidades-tradicionais-EN\">Brazilian legislation</a>, <strong>traditional peoples</strong> identify as culturally distinct groups. They maintain ways of life closely tied to nature and their own social organization, and they use knowledge, innovations and practices passed down through generations. Among them are <strong>quilombolas</strong>, traditional Afro-Brazilian communities formed by rural Black communities with their own historical trajectories, specific territorial relations and Black ancestry linked to the period of slavery; and <strong>ribeirinhos</strong>, traditional riverine communities, especially in the Amazon, whose ways of life are closely connected to the river and the surrounding forest.   </p></div><h3>An Indigenous Bioeconomy for the Amazon</h3><p>As deforestation and degradation in the Amazon draw increasing global attention, interest is growing in building an Indigenous-led bioeconomy. About <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/vision_amazon/living_amazon_initiative222/protected_areas_and_indigenous_territories/\">2.7 million Indigenous Peoples</a> live in the Amazon, and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-could-bioeconomy-amazon-look\">research shows</a> that they are effective land stewards, with forest loss rates <a href=\"https://alerta.mapbiomas.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/RAD2024_28_10.pdf\">30 times lower</a> than in comparable forest areas managed by others.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/bioeconomy-amazon-concepts-limits-and-trends-proper-definition-tropical-forest-biome\">bioeconomy is a concept</a> with competing and often contested definitions that reflect different economic and political priorities. Within this context, the Indigenous bioeconomy offers a distinct model for the Amazon — one rooted in Indigenous governance and ancestral knowledge that generates income while keeping the forest standing. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-center \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1200\" />\n              <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1200\" />\n              <source height=\"804\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"633\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"379\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A Tikuna woman chops Brazil nuts at the local Tikuna market in Tabatinga, Brazil\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/a-tikuna-woman-chops-brazil-nuts-at-the-local-tikuna-market-in-tabatinga-brazil.png?VersionId=aPt8i9J8JH3ppiyTfE56IT1AV_L_H_oI&itok=qmOX5b9R\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>An Indigenous Tikuna woman chops local Brazil nuts at the local Tikuna market in Tabatinga in the Brazilian Amazon. Photo by All Media Vagalume/WRI Brasil</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Rather than treating nature as a commodity, it recognizes the interdependence of land, people, animals, plants and ecosystems. It prioritizes diverse, forest-based production that sustains livelihoods and protects biodiversity. Economic activities are aligned with the forest’s natural rhythms — not the other way around — and territorial governance is strengthened to maintain the ecological integrity of Indigenous lands. </p><p>“A true bioeconomy presupposes diversity, recognition and the appreciation of the peoples who hold and sustain it,” said Junqueira, noting that Indigenous approaches avoid replicating extractive models that concentrate income and exclude forest communities. </p><p>Data from WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/new-economy-brazil-amazon\">New Economy for the Amazon</a> report shows that pursuing a deforestation-free, low-carbon pathway could create an additional 312,000 jobs in the region by 2050 and boost the Brazilian Amazon’s annual GDP from that year onward by at least 40 billion reais ($8.2 billion). It could also contribute an estimated 226 billion reais ($50 billion) to Brazil’s overall GDP. Beyond these quantifiable benefits, investing in the Indigenous bioeconomy can offer lasting value, from ecosystem services across multiple traditional service sectors to food security for Indigenous and traditional peoples. It can also help address systemic exclusion and strengthen Indigenous leadership and authority over territorial governance.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-center full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Handicrafts at the local Tikuna market in Tapatinga, Brazil\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-01/handicrafts-at-the-local-tikuna-market-in-tapatinga-brazil.jpg?VersionId=0YAjWlT05QQtLOCW5DUgPP088ZCQA6bl&h=2e3eca71&itok=dc_P1cSq\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Handicrafts are another example of products that stimulate the Indigenous bioeconomy.

These elements not only set it apart from conventional forest-based industries, but they are also key to ensuring that a bioeconomy delivers benefits for people, nature and the climate. Grounded in climate justice, they address historical and structural inequities by securing Indigenous and traditional peoples’ decision-making power, land tenure and fair participation in sustainable economic activity. </p><h4>Reciprocity. Production that Values Ecosystems</h4><p>Clearing land for crops, cattle, logging or mining has long dominated the Amazon’s economy. This model prioritizes production, often degrading forests and land while excluding the people who depend on them. In contrast, reciprocity is a key element of the Indigenous bioeconomy, where production, exchange and trade sustain both people and the forest, including animals, plants, rivers and other parts of the ecosystem. Collective benefit takes precedence over individual profit, with income generated from activities that maintain biodiversity and tree cover.</p><p>In the Xingu River Basin in the southern Amazon, for example, <a href=\"https://concertacaoamazonia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Volume-3_Bioeconomia-indigena-1.pdf\">the Ikpeng gatherers</a> never collect all the seeds they find along the trails, recognizing that some must be left to allow trees to grow and produce seeds for future generations.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://concertacaoamazonia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Volume-3_Bioeconomia-indigena-1.pdf\">the Baniwa communities</a> make traditional handicrafts, from ceramics to woven baskets, using sustainably gathered materials and techniques that preserve the forest by following seasonal cycles and material availability, while also supporting their livelihoods. This kind of ancestral knowledge about native species and their seasons helps keep harvesting in the Amazon sustainable.</p><h4>Redistribution. Benefits that Circulate Rather Than Concentrate</h4><p>Wealth generated from natural resources in the Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01387-7\">typically left the region, while environmental and social harm remains</a>. For example, large-scale monoculture soy production has caused the disappearance of plant species important as medicines and food staples for Indigenous people.</p><p>In the Indigenous bioeconomy, redistribution means resources and benefits are shared fairly, ensuring economic gains are equally circulated rather than concentrated. It helps promote local economic stability, social cohesion and solidarity. It also strengthens collective well-being, not only of people but also of “more-than-humans” — a term reflecting the Indigenous view that people are not at the top of a hierarchy but are part of a deep interconnection with other beings, tied to spiritual beliefs about nature, ancestors and sacred places.</p><p>Redistribution can take shape through initiatives like <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2024/02/in-brazils-soy-belt-community-seed-banks-offer-hope-for-the-amazon/\">community seed banks</a>, which promote sharing resources rather than concentrating them. By exchanging seeds with other communities, these banks help restore species that have disappeared in some territories, using seeds from areas where they still thrive.</p>\n\n      \n\n    \n    \n<div class=\"embedded-entity embed--block-type--in-this-series has-border-background-color\">\n      <h3 class=\"embed-block__title\">Related</h3>\n  \n  \n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-featured-items field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/forests\" hreflang=\"en\">Forests</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-could-bioeconomy-amazon-look\" hreflang=\"en\">What Could a “Bioeconomy” in the Amazon Look Like?</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            November 14, 2022\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Aerial view of Amazon River\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2022-11/shutterstock_335594075.jpg?VersionId=YgrYWc9hyfamaFainDFBQRmp0IR9.W9Z&h=fa04d214&itok=zkZT5MX6\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/equitable-development\" hreflang=\"en\">Equity & Governance</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-forest-pledges-must-center-forest-communities\" hreflang=\"en\">For New Global Forest Pledges to Succeed, They Must Center Forest Communities</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            November 7, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Two men paddling a boat to collect acai berries in the Amazon Rainforest.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2025-10/hero.jpg?VersionId=p0_HVQTmmiqg2cvczygn3wwU6SgYdOo0&h=f2fcf546&itok=-3WavJWe\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n<h4>Recognition. Centering Indigenous Governance and Land Rights</h4><p>The Indigenous bioeconomy is inseparable from the forest ecosystem and Indigenous expertise. It places ancestral knowledge at the center of sustainable production while working together with modern science to help communities manage natural resources and develop new products and services.</p><p>Central to this approach is recognition: Indigenous and traditional peoples must have secure land rights, the authority to decide how resources, knowledge, intellectual property and data are managed, as well as how value is created and shared, based on their free, prior and informed consent. Without recognition, communities remain vulnerable to the appropriation of their practices and innovations as economic activities unfold in their territories.</p><p>“Without territory, there is no bioeconomy,” said Junqueira. This is because without land recognition and governance authority, Indigenous populations face logging, land grabbing and restrictions that prevent them from managing the forest they protect. Community-led practices, such as selective harvesting, cannot shape markets or production systems without secure rights and decision-making power.</p><p>The Jiquitaia chili pepper, <a href=\"https://www.landrightsnow.org/the-women-behind-baniwa-jiquitaia-pepper/\">harvested and sold by Baniwa Indigenous women</a> in Alto Rio Negro in the northeastern Amazon, shows what recognition looks like in practice. Produced using traditional knowledge and harvesting methods developed over generations, the chili is commercialized according to the Baniwa women themselves, ensuring Indigenous authority over how the product is managed, valued and brought to market. It is a key example of connecting traditional stewardship with market opportunities while preserving the forest and reinforcing Indigenous control over land, knowledge and value creation.</p><h4>Respect. Production that Honors Culture, Knowledge and Heritage</h4><p>Respect for Indigenous peoples, their practices, sacred land and spiritual beliefs is essential, as the Indigenous bioeconomy requires accepting economic models and definitions beyond a basic capitalist or market system. In this approach, products and services are not the end, but a means of safeguarding ways of life, systems of knowledge and heritage.</p><p>Respect is expressed clearly in Indigenous food systems, which connect forest conservation, livelihoods and collective well-being. Climate change, deforestation and market pressures are disrupting these systems, contributing to the loss of Indigenous staples, shifts toward ultra-processed foods and increased malnutrition and food scarcity. By supporting forest-based livelihoods, agroforestry, fisheries and local value chains rooted in ancestral knowledge, the Indigenous bioeconomy helps restore access to nutritious, culturally appropriate foods while generating income without forest loss. Sustainable harvesting practices also protect ancient monumental constructions (geoglifos) and sacred natural sites (kymyrury), unlike large-scale clearing of land for farming and ranching.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-center full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Amazon market food in Tabatinga, featuring everyday staples of the local diet, including cassava flour, tapioca, bananas and garlic.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-01/amazon-market-food-in-tabatinga-featuring-everyday-staples-of-the-local-diet-including-cassava-flour-tapioca-bananas-and-garlic.jpg?VersionId=vZWTWcNpMdddgSGiagTly1c4f7eHYD2k&h=2e3eca71&itok=13OzFRNW\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Amazon market food in Tabatinga, featuring everyday staples of the local diet, including cassava flour, tapioca, bananas and garlic.

The process is valued because it integrates ancestral knowledge, community practices, technologies and diverse ways of producing and sharing resources. Maintaining the close connection between the way of doing things and its consequences for the social division of labor is what makes production meaningful.    </p><h4>A Path Forward for the Indigenous Bioeconomy </h4><p>In the Amazon, where <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/strategies-amazon-rainforest-climate-action-brazil\">social inequalities and environmental pressures create complex challenges</a> for sustainable development, the Indigenous bioeconomy offers a viable way forward.</p><p>Rooted in reciprocity, redistribution, recognition and respect, it is an approach that links economic opportunity with land stewardship and a commitment to collective well-being.

      "pubDate": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:00:00 EST",
      "description": "<p>Roughly two-thirds of the ocean lies outside any single country's jurisdiction. These vast waters, known as the \"high seas,\" hold huge importance to the health of the planet, housing rich biodiversity and natural resources that are vital for both the climate and economies. Yet a comprehensive framework to govern and safeguard the high seas has been missing — until now.</p><p>After nearly 20 years of negotiations, governments, ocean advocates and others finally secured a global treaty to protect and sustainably use the ocean areas that lie beyond countries' jurisdictions. The \"High Seas Treaty\" — formally known as the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en\">BBNJ agreement</a>) — was ratified in September 2025 and officially enters into force on Jan. 17, 2026. From this date, ratifying countries are legally bound by the agreement to support conservation and sustainable management of high‐seas biodiversity.</p><p>While this marks a major milestone, several key aspects of the treaty still need to be ironed out. Detailed compliance and implementation procedures are expected to be finalized at the treaty's first summit — the \"Conference of Parties,\" or \"BBNJ COP\" — within the next year. These discussions will cover critical issues, like the designation of high seas marine protected areas; how to assess the environmental impacts of ocean activities that happen beyond national jurisdictions; and how to fairly share benefits from marine genetic resources.</p><p>In the lead-up to this landmark summit and the treaty's full rollout, here's what to know.</p><h3>Why the High Seas Treaty Matters</h3><p>The ambition of the High Seas Treaty has always been immense. It seeks to facilitate international coordination on activities within Earth's largest public common, covering around half the planet's surface.</p><p>The high seas host a diverse array of marine life, from microscopic plankton to colossal blue whales. Alongside supporting global fisheries and food security, they are home to valuable natural resources that countries and companies are ever-more eager to explore and exploit. For example, marine genetic materials are increasingly sought after to support pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and other innovations.</p><p>Without a binding global treaty, the high seas have been governed patchwork style through regional fisheries agreements, shipping conventions, and scattered marine protected areas which cover <a href=\"https://mpatlas.org/countries/HS/\">less than 1%</a> of the high seas. This leaves critical gaps in protecting marine biodiversity and ensuring that developing countries also benefit from discoveries made in international waters.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About Sustainable Ocean Plans</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\"><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/sustainable-ocean-plans\">Sustainable Ocean Plans</a> are comprehensive \"umbrella frameworks\" that unify all of a country's ocean-related policies, plans and mechanisms and help align them with international frameworks and best practices. All 19 member countries of the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/high-level-panel-sustainable-ocean-economy\">Ocean Panel</a> have agreed to producing an SOP. The <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance</a> is a further collection of coastal and ocean nations that have agreed to implement SOPs, including the Republic of Korea and Panama.</p></div><p>The High Seas Treaty will fill regulatory gaps, complement national efforts and enable coordinated conservation measures on the high seas, all of which will be critical for achieving international <a href=\"https://globalgoals.org/goals/14-life-below-water/\">climate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/gbf\">biodiversity</a> goals. It will also help guide regional cooperation and link seamlessly to countries' <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/sustainable-ocean-plans/\">sustainable ocean plans</a>, through which 21 nations have pledged to sustainably manage 100% of the ocean areas under their jurisdiction.</p><p>Together, these measures will come together to create a more cohesive system of ocean stewardship spanning from coastlines to open ocean.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two divers swim near colorful coral reefs.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/coral-reef-high-seas_0.jpg?VersionId=dz33TQ2qAdQictZslfe_Ehf3w7B5jxG9&h=62bc044e&itok=eQ9bfSJ_\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The ocean is full of rich natural resources, like genetic material from coral, that countries and companies are looking to use for everything from pharmaceuticals to new technologies.

MPAs are typically clearly defined geographical spaces that are recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.</p><p>Some MPAs <a href=\"https://www.ospar.org/work-areas/bdc/marine-protected-areas/mpas-in-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction\">already exist</a> on the high seas. For example, six MPAs were established in the Northeast Atlantic in 2010 with a total area of 286,200 square kilometers (110,502 square miles). The <a href=\"https://www.asoc.org/campaign/ross-sea-mpa/\">Ross Sea MPA</a> was established in 2016 to protect a total area of 1.5 million square kilometers (600,000 square miles) in the Southern Ocean.</p><p>The treaty will also establish a pathway for proposing new zones for protection via a consultation process, supported by scientific evidence.</p><h4>2) Marine genetic resources</h4><p>The treaty will establish rules for sharing financial and non-financial benefits from the commercial application of genetic material sourced from high-seas marine organisms, such as bacteria, corals or deep-sea sponges. This material can be used in medicine, cosmetics, food and biotechnology; innovations with <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/ocean-human-health/\">huge potential benefits</a> for human health and wellbeing.</p><h4>3) Capacity building and transfer of marine technology</h4><p>The High Seas Treaty also supports technology and knowledge sharing — particularly to low-income countries that need these resources to advance conservation and sustainable ocean management and ensure they can participate fully in high-seas governance.</p><h4>4) Environmental impact assessments</h4><p>Some countries and companies are proposing activities such as <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/marine-carbon-dioxide-removal/\">marine carbon dioxide removal approaches</a> in areas beyond national borders. The treaty will create a standard process for these actors to conduct assessments that can be shared transparently and follow international standards.</p><h3>What's Not Included in the Agreement?</h3><p>The High Seas Treaty is designed to work within the parameters of existing legal instruments, frameworks and bodies, such as Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and existing fisheries agreements. For example, RFMOs will maintain responsibility for setting quotas and fishing rules under their jurisdiction.</p><p>While the High Seas Treaty will not directly regulate fisheries management, it <em>will </em>shape how fisheries operate on the high seas. This means influencing the environmental standards that fisheries must meet and encouraging a more joined‐up, ecosystem‐based approach to managing ocean resources. This will require closer coordination between fisheries bodies and new High Seas Treaty institutions, along with more data sharing and scientific input.</p><h3>Which Countries Have Ratified the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>As of Jan. 15, the High Seas Treaty has been ratified by 83 parties, who are now legally bound to it. These are also the only countries that will have a say at the treaty summit (BBJN COP) later this year. Countries that have signed but not yet ratified the treaty are not currently legally required to fulfil its requirements. However, they <em>are </em>committed to refraining from activities that contradict the treaty's objectives.</p><p>Countries that were among the first to ratify the treaty included island states such as Palau, Cuba and the Maldives; European Union members including France, Portugal and Spain; and other nations, such as Chile, Norway and South Korea.

Photo by the European Commission.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>What's Next for the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>The High Seas Treaty coming into force is only the first step toward its implementation. For the treaty to be effective, parties need to agree on a strong underlying framework and governance structures that will support its rollout.</p><p>Efforts are already underway. The BBNJ Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) is working to shape treaty operations and prepare for the first BBNJ COP (the date of which has yet to be set). Two preparatory meetings were held in April and August 2025 at the UN Headquarters in New York. The final meeting will be held in the same place from March 23-April 2, 2026.</p><p>These meetings give governments and negotiators an opportunity to develop recommendations that will shape critical elements of the treaty. This includes:</p><ul><li>Forming governing structures.</li><li>Outlining the roles and responsibilities of institutions, such as those that provide data and scientific and technical advice.</li><li>Creating tools and mechanisms to ensure equitable implementation of the treaty.</li><li>Establishing systems to ensure funding and technical knowledge is distributed so all member states can fully participate.</li></ul><p>So far, discussions at these meetings have focused on the operational logistics of the treaty's key bodies. This includes the Scientific and Technical Body, which will advise on science, environmental impact assessments and marine protected areas, and the Clearing House Mechanism, which will serve as a hub for sharing data. Discussions have also centred around financial rules and mechanisms to ensure active participation from all willing governments, such that all goals outlined in the treaty can be reached.</p><p>The last preparatory meeting will aim to see key recommendations finalized, with the intention of bringing these forward and hopefully getting them adopted at the first BBNJ COP. For meaningful implementation of the treaty to begin, is critical that this last meeting is constructive and reaches consensus. Only with the right governing and financial mechanisms in place can the High Seas Treaty go from a landmark agreement to a fully functioning international treaty that protects the global ocean.</p><p>Management of the ocean needs to be as interconnected as the ocean itself. By connecting national actions with a robust global treaty, the world can ensure a resilient, equitable and thriving ocean for generations to come. This treaty is a milestone in the international drive to protect and sustainably use the ocean as a shared resource. Now, nations must turn this into effective action with a robust management and governance framework.</p><p><em>Editor's Note: This article was originally published on June 5, 2025 and updated on Jan. 15, 2026, to reflect the High Seas Treaty coming into force.</em></p>",

Two things were abundantly clear: For one, there’s no such thing as climate-friendly beef, despite labels claiming otherwise. Secondly, some producers are making progress on animal welfare and certain environmental metrics. But while there are technical ways to reduce beef’s emissions, market constraints and the lack of credible, verifiable labels mean that sourcing genuinely lower-emissions beef remains out of reach for most buyers in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>In short? <strong>The only way to guarantee you’re lowering the climate impact of your beef is to buy less of it.</strong></p><p>Here, we answer common questions about beef’s environmental impacts and what food purchasers <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/beef-purchasing-food-service-considerations-companies-balancing-climate-and-other-priorities\">can realistically do</a> — now and in the future — to reduce their climate footprint.</p><h3>Why does beef have such a high environmental footprint compared to other meats?</h3><p>For one, beef cattle take longer to mature (about 1.5-2 years) than other animals like pigs (5-6 months) and poultry (1.5-2 months). They also produce fewer offspring. As a result, they require significantly more feed — and land to grow it. More land per unit of meat means <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered\">greater resource use and higher environmental impacts</a> per gram of protein or kilogram of meat.</p><p>When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions specifically, the climate impact of beef comes from four main sources.</p><p>First are <strong>agricultural production emissions</strong> from actions like applying fertilizers, storing manure and using tractor fuels. This also includes emissions from the production of feed, fertilizers, pesticides and other materials used on the farm.</p><p>Ruminant animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats also have a unique digestive process that generates methane through <strong>enteric fermentation</strong>, primarily released through belching. This adds to their relatively high agricultural production emissions.</p><p>Then there are the emissions produced through beef processing, transportation and other post-farm activities. These are added to the production emissions to arrive at the total <strong>agricultural supply chain emissions</strong>.</p><p>Lastly, natural ecosystems like forests are often converted into pastures to raise cattle and farms to grow animal feed. The loss of these ecosystems’ carbon-storage potential is known as a <strong>carbon opportunity cost</strong>. The importance of accounting for the carbon opportunity cost of agricultural land use is increasingly recognized. When doing so, it typically accounts for the largest portion of beef’s overall climate impact.</p><p>The combination of agricultural supply chain emissions and carbon opportunity cost make up the <strong>total carbon costs</strong> of beef production.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1610\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"1352\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1036\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"816\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"488\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Total carbon costs of U.S. beef production.\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/total-carbon-costs-of-us-beef-production_0.png?VersionId=uX7rFUfQPd5CeK8pF4kvBtWFE4DE_Hzq&itok=NnT64Thl\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Are certain types of cattle farming better for the climate than others?</h3><p>Both location and farming methods can reduce the climate impacts of beef production, but they offer very limited opportunities at this time.</p><p>We’ll start with location.</p><p>Ruminant animals like cattle can graze on land that is too arid, rocky or hilly for crops or forests to grow, such as native grasslands. In these cases, well-managed grazing can offer significant benefits — such as providing livelihoods for millions of pastoralists and preserving <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/grassland-benefits\">native grasslands</a>, which are important for carbon storage, water provision and more.</p><p>The problem is that only <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912416300013\">37% of land</a> used globally to graze or feed cattle and buffalo is unsuitable for crops. The rest occurs on land where, from a climate perspective, it would be far more efficient to grow food crops — or where forests or other natural ecosystems could be restored. As a result, producing beef in the U.S. and Europe requires more than 3 times as much cropland per kilogram of edible protein as producing milk, eggs, pork and chicken — and 7 times more than producing beans.</p><p>Meanwhile, global demand for beef <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/beef-and-buffalo-meat-production-tonnes?tab=line\">continues to rise</a>, making it unrealistic to limit its production only to land unsuitable for crops or forests.

Indeed, emissions per kilogram of beef production have been declining for decades as farmers find ways to raise cattle more efficiently, using less land and fewer resources. Continued efficiency gains, grazing optimization, improved disease management, feed additives, and changes in animal breeding and genetics <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751731119003100\">can further reduce emissions</a>.</p><p>However, while some of these emissions-reducing technologies <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/reducing-agricultural-methane-new-solutions\">already exist</a>, adoption can be challenging due to costs and other constraints.

These reductions could be achieved through a combination of strategies, including reducing methane emissions from enteric fermentation; manufacturing feed additives with mostly solar energy; and increasing carbon sequestration by improving grazing practices, planting legumes on pastures, and developing varieties of feed crops with enhanced root growth and function.<strong> However, WRI’s new analysis finds that when the full impacts of land use are considered (measured using carbon opportunity cost), even implementing every existing and breakthrough mitigation technology would only reduce U.S. beef’s total carbon costs by 18%.</strong></p><p>While still considerable, even this best-case scenario means that beef would still have higher emissions per gram of protein than most other foods.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1727\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1381\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1058\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"833\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"499\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Ways to reduce emissions from U.S. beef cattle\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/beef-emissions-graphic_0.png?VersionId=GDx9YiDPp1N9cR0MGQA_NlZLF14cAC5F&itok=KOQSzgCk\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>What about organic, grass-fed or regeneratively produced beef?  </h3><p>Alternative systems like those that produce organic or grass-fed beef do offer some environmental and other benefits. They can improve animal welfare, reduce antibiotic use, and boost soil health and on-farm biodiversity. But from a climate perspective, they generally require more land than conventional agriculture, resulting in higher total carbon costs per gram of protein.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/better-meat-sourcing-climate-environmental-impacts\">previous WRI research</a> found that the total carbon costs associated with grass-fed beef were more than double those of feedlot-finished beef, per kilogram. Organic beef’s total carbon costs were 28% greater than conventional beef.</p><p>Less research has explicitly studied regenerative grazing systems, which tend to focus on improving soil quality. But since many regenerative practices overlap with those in grass-fed or organic systems, the same emissions and land use concerns apply, though they can offer soil health and climate resilience benefits.</p><p>All of this said, practices used in conventional and alternative systems aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive, and both systems have room to improve. In conventional systems, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=105076\">introducing rotational grazing practices</a> prior to feedlot finishing could improve soil health and potentially help draw down carbon into soils. Grass-fed or organic operations could implement practices to improve productivity and reduce animal disease, which could lower land occupation and total carbon costs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"925\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"740\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"567\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"447\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"267\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cutting up beef in a slaughterhouse\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/beef-processing_0.jpg?VersionId=4waTpz8TigOpT0EqWUGCSKwFT_FYhHdu&itok=yjcp3JtB\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>While lower-emissions beef exists, it's very hard to find and purchase given market and other constraints.

For example, beef cattle typically live on multiple farms throughout their lives, with most emissions occurring when the calf is still nursing and grazing on pasture with its mother. Most large beef suppliers do not know where cattle were raised prior to the feedlot or slaughterhouse.  </p><p>This lack of supply chain transparency combined with a dearth of market-ready and traceable low-emissions options means that purchasers in the U.S. cannot yet identify which beef is produced using lower-emissions practices, relative to national or regional averages.  </p><h3>What about labels touting lower-emissions beef?</h3><p>In the U.S., labels are beginning to offer certified “carbon neutral” or “net zero” beef. These claims are largely based on carbon offsetting — either purchasing investments in renewable energy or counting carbon removals from growth of nearby trees. Only one of five labels we reviewed mentioned strategies to directly reduce production emissions.</p><p>It’s currently impossible to independently verify any claims made by these emerging labels. None of the U.S. labels we reviewed provide publicly available data (such as peer-reviewed life cycle assessments or other accounting analyses) to reflect their cattle’s full lifespan. Further data is also needed to evaluate each certification’s impacts on yields (or meat production per hectare) to understand the effect on total carbon costs.</p><p>Filling these data gaps is necessary to both verify labels’ claims and help purchasers find legitimately lower-emissions beef alongside their other animal welfare and sustainability goals.</p><p>But let’s be clear: While there are ways to lower beef’s emissions and credibly demonstrate that, it is highly unlikely that beef could ever be truly “net zero” in its climate impact.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1051\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"841\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"644\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"304\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Beef cattle lined up at a livestock market\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/cattle-market_0.jpg?VersionId=b__3zodH9OuiCO_n8L3z6w9_zCjT7onl&itok=toe5MwIs\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Beef cattle at a livestock market.

Food service companies can reduce their emissions by shifting toward <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/food-service-playbook-promoting-sustainable-food-choices\">plant-forward meals</a> with more diverse protein sources, such as legumes, nuts, seeds and alternative proteins. <br /> </li><li><strong>Balance priorities.</strong> Food purchasing organizations aiming to meet animal welfare, antibiotic use, or other sustainable sourcing commitments may wish to source grass-fed or organic beef. To meet climate commitments while doing so, they’ll need to source <em>even less</em> beef to offset any higher emissions from these alternative systems. Our report provides scenarios quantifying how much less beef is needed to meet multiple priorities at once.<br /> </li><li><strong>Engage producers to adopt climate-friendlier practices. </strong>Work directly with existing producers and suppliers to adopt practices that reduce emissions. Funding or partnering on projects that reduce emissions may help drive scale and adoption. <br /> </li></ol><p>Although labels that verify lower-emissions beef are not yet widely available, they may be in the future as data and supply chain traceability improve. In the meantime, food purchasing organizations <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/beef-purchasing-food-service-considerations-companies-balancing-climate-and-other-priorities\">can still make progress</a> on reducing their total emissions and help create a market for more sustainable and lower-emissions beef. While achieving carbon-neutral beef is likely unfeasible, reducing beef-related emissions as much as possible is an important tool in the climate toolbox. At the same time, efforts to support lower-emissions practices must go hand-in-hand with reducing overall demand for beef.</p>",
