      "description": "<p><strong>MEXICO CITY (November 11, 2025)</strong> – Mexico has officially approved and presented its new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) at COP30. The <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/semarnat/documentos/mensaje-de-la-secretaria-alicia-barcena-ibarra-al-presentar-la-ndc-3-0-de-mexico-en-la-sesion-plenaria-de-la-cumbre-climatica-de-lideres?state=published\">plan</a> marks a milestone in the country’s climate policy, introducing for the first time an absolute emissions cap for 2035 that covers all greenhouse gases and sectors of the economy.</p><p>Reinforcing its contribution to the Paris Agreement’s objectives, Mexico has committed to reducing emissions to 364–404 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) unconditionally, and to 332–363 MtCO2e with international support — a level the government estimates represents a reduction of more than 50% compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The NDC includes five interconnected components — mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, enabling conditions and means of implementation, and cross-cutting themes — that together outline a pathway for inclusive, low-carbon growth and resilient development.</p><p><em>See the </em><a href=\"https://es.wri.org/noticias/declaracion-mexico-anuncia-un-nuevo-y-firme-compromiso-climatico\"><em>Spanish version</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Below is a statement from Francisco Barnés Regueiro, Executive Director, World Resources Institute Mexico:</strong></p><p>“Mexico’s new climate plan stands among the most ambitious new climate targets from a major emitter, charting a path toward a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economy. It places people and nature at the heart of decision-making and reflects the government’s intent to align climate action with economic opportunity, jobs, social equity, and sustainable growth.</p><p>\"Mexico is aiming for deep emission cuts by 2035, in line with its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 – backed by an absolute target for greater transparency and accountability.</p><p>“On adaptation, the plan strengthens actions across five strategic areas, from climate-resilient production systems and integrated water management to the protection of strategic infrastructure and cultural heritage. New components on loss and damage, as well as on climate and security, reflect the government’s focus on managing the social and economic risks of the climate crisis.</p><p>“The NDC also embeds principles of gender equality, human rights, and intergenerational equity, ensuring that climate action addresses inequality, poverty, and vulnerability. It aims to deliver a just transition that creates decent jobs and broadens economic opportunity for women, Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, youth, and others historically left behind.</p><p>“Mexico’s ambition is clear, but delivering on these goals will require deep structural transformation and a clear, sustained investment strategy that positions climate action as a driver of inclusive and sustainable growth. Success will depend on clear sectoral pathways, robust financing mechanisms, and strong implementation plans once the full NDC is released. Aligning public budgets, financial instruments, and subnational policies with this new climate plan will be critical to unlocking innovation, boosting competitiveness, and creating good-quality jobs in low-carbon sectors.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>Today, WRI joined, as a partner, the Beat the Heat (Mutirão contra o Calor Extremo) initiative, a new effort launched at COP30 led by the COP30 presidency and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)’s Cool Coalition.</p><p>Beat the Heat helps accelerate the implementation of local solutions to mitigate extreme heat, which contributes to more than 500,000 deaths each year. It also aims to advance sustainable cooling mechanisms through new technical assistance and financing pathways. The initiative invites countries, cities and regions to join a collective effort to turn UNEP’s <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-cooling-pledge\">Global Cooling Pledge</a> into meaningful local action and put the EPIC Facility, the pledge’s key implementation mechanism, into operation.</p><p>WRI will serve as a core analytical and technical assistance partner for Beat the Heat, lending its urban analytics and capacity-building expertise to support local action.</p><p>Through this initiative, partners have committed to supporting cities in implementing solutions using a dual approach: enabling direct access to funding for on-the-ground implementation and providing technical assistance through a suite of technical partners. New commitments at COP30 bring the number of endorsers of Beat the Heat to <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/amid-rising-heat-sustainable-cooling-can-slash-emissions-and-save\">more than 185 cities as well as 83 partner organizations</a>.</p><p>“Heat is the people’s agenda,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, WRI’s vice president and regional director for Europe, at the Beat the Heat launch event in Belém. “Cities are key to protecting people against heat. We need better data so we can invest at speed and scale.” </p><h3>Building Knowledge and Capacity for Cooler Cities</h3><p>WRI’s partnership on Beat the Heat builds on its extensive experience working with cities on several initiatives that support urban heat mitigation.</p><p>One of these initiatives is the Cool Cities Lab, a data platform that enables detailed analysis of local heat risk and cooling solutions. Slated to launch in March 2026, the platform will allow cities to explore fine-grain metrics, identify the neighborhoods most vulnerable to rising temperatures and tailor action plans to effectively reduce heat risks.</p><p>The Cool Cities Lab also enables cities to model the potential heat-reduction impact of a range of local solutions, from street trees to cool roofs and shade structures. By exploring the cooling potential of different interventions, individually or in combination, cities can develop data-informed intervention plans that deliver meaningful cooling benefits.  </p><p>Through the Cool Cities Lab, WRI will provide data and analysis to cities participating in Beat the Heat.</p><p>Another initiative, the <a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/projetos/acelerador-solucoes-calor-urbano\">Urban Heat Solutions Accelerator</a>, provides capacity building on developing urban cooling projects currently being implemented to support five Brazilian cities. By focusing on building cities’ long-term capacity to develop heat-resilience projects and establishing reliable financing mechanisms to support implementation, the Accelerator offers the potential to produce lessons and best practices that can strengthen the global Beat the Heat initiative.  </p><p>WRI and Drexel University’s Climate Change and Urban Health in Latin America Project (SALURBAL) are also conducting research on how heat, in combination with social factors and multiple aspects of the built environment, influences health-related impacts in neighborhoods in Belo Horizonte and Campinas, Brazil. Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/heat-and-health-brazilian-cities\">Heat and Health in Brazilian Cities project</a>, WRI is working with community members and policymakers in both cities to guide research and  support the design and implementation of heat adaptation measures that safeguard health and promote equity.</p><h3>Speeding Up Action for Heat-Resilient Cities</h3><p>With climate change intensifying and increasingly threatening lives and livelihoods, now is the time for cities to take meaningful action on heat. WRI Ross Center is proud to join the coalition of partners behind Beat the Heat and contribute to the technical expertise needed to accelerate the implementation of effective heat solutions in more cities.  </p><p><em>Interested in joining the effort to Beat the Heat? </em><a href=\"https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=2zWeD09UYE-9zF6kFubccOWo9BkcgmJOo2607C_CGg5UNDdJT1JDUUlEM1pNOVkwRlY5TjBLQlRLQy4u&route=shorturl\"><em>Register here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Want to learn more about Cool Cities Lab? </em><a href=\"https://worldresourcesinstitute.typeform.com/subscribe-ccl?typeform-source=word-edit.officeapps.live.com\"><em>Sign up for updates</em></a><em>.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Launched by the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition and partners, the initiative will help companies scale clean energy solutions, decarbonize sectors and generate green jobs across the region.</em></p><p><strong>(Belém, BRASIL) November 11, 2025</strong> — At COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition – in partnership with Global Renewables Alliance (GRA), Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and Climate Group’s RE100 initiative – today launched the Latin America Clean Energy Coalition (LACEC), a major initiative to rapidly scale corporate clean energy adoption and accelerate Latin America's transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.</p><p>The coalition brings together leading companies, energy developers, financiers, civil society and policymakers to unlock investment, accelerate breakthrough solutions and advance policies that make clean energy more affordable, accessible and scalable across the region. Together, these efforts will help Latin America move closer to reaching its goal of tripling renewables by 2030. Nike is the founding member.  </p><p>“Latin America has all the ingredients to lead the global energy transition,” said <strong>Fernando Páez, Executive Director of WRI Colombia</strong>, “With over 60% of the region's electricity already from clean sources and more than 2 million renewable energy jobs created in 2023, the foundation is strong – but much more must be done. LACEC will mobilize the private sector to turn that potential into action – helping industries decarbonize, strengthen competitiveness, and spark new job growth.”</p><p>Despite this potential, the region faces persistent challenges that slow the adoption of clean energy. Current national plans and targets are projected to deliver only half of the annual growth in renewable power needed to stay on track. Key obstacles include an energy mix overly reliant on hydropower, weak grid infrastructure, and limited cross-border interconnections – gaps that LACEC aims to address.</p><p>“Latin America’s clean energy potential is immense, but realizing it takes more than ambition – it takes action,” said <strong>Trigya Singh, Senior Manager Corporate Sourcing, Global Renewables Alliance</strong>. “Through LACEC, we're helping energy buyers, sellers and policymakers involved in sourcing renewable energy, access renewable power more easily, clearing regulatory roadblocks, and sparking a wave of clean energy projects. These projects will help boost energy security, drive sustainable growth and transform Latin America.”</p><p>Building on the successful Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) model, which catalyzed corporate renewable energy adoption across Asian markets, LACEC will serve as Latin America's hub for clean energy leadership and knowledge exchange. The coalition will help companies design and implement robust renewable energy strategies, work with governments to drive enabling policies, and coordinate finance and investment to rapidly scale clean energy projects across industrial and manufacturing sectors.</p><p>“Success in Latin America's renewable energy transition won't come from technology alone – it needs effective collaboration and strong governance,” said <strong>María Teresa Ruiz-Tagle, Executive Director, Corporate Leaders Group for Climate Action – Chile (CLG Chile)</strong>. “The region needs a clear roadmap built on public-private-civil collaboration, with smarter storage, streamlined regulations and electrifying key sectors. We're convinced LACEC can help turn these priorities into real progress across Latin America.”</p><p>LACEC will launch its work in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, with plans to expand soon to Chile and Argentina. The coalition builds on WRI's deep regional presence and proven expertise in advancing evidence-based solutions for the global energy transition, together with the industry leadership of GRA, GWEC, and RE100. Further expansion across Latin America is planned for later phases, with a full list of partners to be announced in early 2026.</p><p>“This is a crucial moment for Mexico, as energy demand grows and momentum builds behind renewable energy development,” said<strong> Francisco Urbano Barnés Regueiro, Executive Director, WRI Mexico</strong>. “LACEC is uniquely positioned to help strengthen infrastructure, align policies, and improve energy distribution and storage. We are proud to join this collective effort and contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive energy future for Mexico and the wider Latin America region.” </p><p>Companies interested in joining LACEC or learning more about the coalition can contact Diego Merizalde, Program Lead for the Latin America Clean Energy Coalition, info@latamcleanenergycoalition.com.  </p><hr /><p><strong>About the WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition</strong></p><p>The WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition harnesses analytical power, convening ability and global expertise to help orchestrate the transition to a clean, abundant and reliable energy future by delivering evidence-based, pragmatic and scalable solutions.

      "pubDate": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:20:19 EST",
      "description": "<p><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025)</strong> — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Brazil announced the Belém 4X Pledge on Sustainable Fuels, a commitment to quadruple production and use of ‘sustainable fuels’ by 2035, along with Japan, Italy, India and others. The fuels mentioned in the pledge include hydrogen, biogases, biofuels, and e-fuels.</p><p>The pledge cites a <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/delivering-sustainable-fuels\">new report</a> by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that envisions a quadrupling of these fuels by 2035, including a doubling of biofuel production.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Janet Ranganathan, Managing Director of Strategy, Learning and Results, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“While countries are right to transition away from fossil fuels, they also need to ensure their plans don’t trigger unintended consequences, such as more deforestation either at home or abroad. Doubling biofuel production would have significant implications for the world’s land, especially without guardrails to prevent large-scale expansion of land dedicated to biofuels, which drives ecosystem loss.  </p><p>“Already today, at least 40 million hectares of cropland are used globally to grow biofuel feedstocks, an area the size of Paraguay. And the world’s land is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore\">under pressure</a> to provide more food and wood products for a population that will grow toward 10 billion by 2050. At <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00429-z\">present rates of cropland expansion</a>, an area nearly the size of India would be converted from nature to food production between 2020 and 2050. Increasing biofuel mandates would create significant extra pressure for land conversion.</p><p>“WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/global-land-squeeze-managing-growing-competition-land\">global research</a> shows that expansion of land dedicated to biofuel production is likely to have serious negative impacts on food security, nature, and climate because it competes with food production or natural ecosystems. Biofuel production on agricultural land implies trade-offs with both food production and restoring land to nature. Agricultural products are commodities in global markets, and policies that increase demand for these products will raise prices and likely lead to expansion of new cropland. Both responses are likely to have negative impacts on climate, food security, and nature. Furthermore, many models and carbon accounting frameworks undercount biofuels’ land carbon cost or miss it entirely.</p><p>“That’s why both the land and the types of biomass used for fuels matter. The pledge says that efforts to scale up fuel use must be environmentally and socially responsible. But it does not include critical caveats from the IEA report: that biofuel expansion should not further increase cropland use, and that waste and residue-based biomass potentially offer a more sustainable pathway than feedstocks grown on dedicated land—although the amounts are limited, making scalability challenging. National policies should account for these important nuances.</p><p>“All countries should develop a strategy for how best to use their limited land to advance prosperity and meet people’s growing needs for food, while achieving climate and nature goals. These strategies should align with national pledges to halt deforestation and preserve existing ecosystems. Any mandates that intensify pressure on land risk undermining those commitments.</p><p>“More locally grounded research is needed to inform these strategies. For instance, how can Brazil best use its 40 to 100 million hectares of degraded land to meet its needs for food, wood products, jobs, revenue and energy, while protecting and restoring nature and meeting climate goals? As the demands on our land grow, while the planet’s land area stays the same, evidence-based land-use planning will be essential to balance competing priorities.”</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025)</strong> — The COP30 Leaders’ Summit concluded today with major announcements and pledges from world leaders, as well as political calls to action ahead of the formal negotiations beginning on November 10.</p><p>New initiatives and commitments included the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, a major finance mechanism to protect forests; pledges for Indigenous Peoples and local communities’ finance and land rights; a pledge to quadruple 'sustainable fuels'; a Call to Action on Wildfire Resilience; and the Belém Declaration on Hunger, Poverty and Human-Centered Climate Action.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“Leaders made the journey to Belém to show that investing in cleaner, more resilient economies isn’t just about the environment — it’s about long-term security and competitiveness. They showed they are transitioning their economies with green growth at the core, even as they recognized there’s still a long way to go.</p><p>“Nature was the star of the show, and rightly so in the heart of the Amazon. While we’ve made incredible progress on renewable energy and electric vehicles, leaders are now <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-launches-tropical-forests-forever-facility\">stressing that nature</a> must also be <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-nature-opportunities-2025\">central to the climate battle</a>. Their pledges showed that action is not just about protecting trees. It’s about building an economy around standing forests that supports the people who depend on them, making sure they have <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-countries-announce-pledges-support-indigenous-peoples-afro-descendants-and-local\">land rights and access to finance</a>.</p><p>“The energy transition also took the spotlight. Some countries pledged to transition away from fossil fuels toward ‘sustainable fuels,' but they must ensure the solutions they choose don’t trigger unintended consequences like more deforestation.</p><p>“Cities took center stage at the Local Leaders Forum in Rio, where more than <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.org/cop30-local-leaders-forum/a-message-from-local-leaders-to-cop30/\">14,000 cities, towns, states, regions and provinces</a> affirmed their commitment to advancing on-the-ground climate solutions. The local level is where ambition turns into action. Stronger <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-wri-bloomberg-philanthropies-and-partners-strengthen-city-and-state-climate-action\">partnerships between national and subnational governments</a> will be key to accelerating results.</p><p>“It’s no surprise that Brazil and emerging economies across the Global South are leading the charge to unite the climate, nature and people agendas — from launching the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-launches-tropical-forests-forever-facility\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> to advancing a declaration tackling hunger and poverty. These countries are showing that development and decarbonization go hand in hand.</p><p>“As countries now move toward official negotiations, the hard work begins. Many leaders have stepped up with new <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-un-report-finds-country-climate-commitments-falling-short\">national climate commitments to cut emissions</a>. But there remains a major gap between those plans and the critical benchmark of 1.5C — both in countries’ goals and the action to achieve them. COP30 in Belem needs to confront this gap head on.</p><p>“Governments need to reaffirm the 1.5C target, the benchmark for a livable, healthy planet, and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop30-progress-country-climate-plans\">agree to a roadmap</a> that drastically accelerates implementation. Countries should also spell out clear strategies to transition major sectors and support workers, including in energy, forests & agriculture, and transport —both for the next five years and for the long-term path to net zero.</p><p>“And finally, adaptation will be a major focus. Some developing countries are calling for a new goal to triple adaptation finance by 2030. This looks possible by 2035 but only if every source steps up — from development banks and bilateral aid to new concessional finance and scaled private investment — and the system works better as a whole.\"</p>",

      "description": "<p>Nations around the world are ushering in a new decade of climate action through revised <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs), due this year. The urgency for climate action has never been greater, especially with 2024 marking the warmest year on record globally. While the urban content of NDCs is improving, it remains insufficient and doesn't reflect the increasingly urban world we live in. UN-Habitat analysis showed that only <a href=\"https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2024/06/ndc_global_report_2023_v4_watermark.pdf\">27% of the last round of pledges</a> under the Paris Agreement included strong urban content.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP) for Climate Action</a>, launched at COP28, WRI has worked to advance the subnational content of new NDCs due this year, also known as \"NDCs 3.0.\" The CHAMP initiative is a pledge by 78 countries, to date, to include subnational governments in producing new NDCs as well as incorporate strong subnational content into these plans in order to progress, finance and deliver more ambitious and inclusive climate action overall.</p><p>Through CHAMP, WRI has provided technical assistance to four countries in particular during this latest round of NDC updates, with each demonstrating how cooperation is essential for ambitious climate action:</p><h3>Colombia</h3><p>In 2024, WRI Colombia and Colombia's Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/empowering-cities-to-shape-stronger-more-inclusive-ndcs-lessons-from-colombia/\">designed and launched a strategy to involve subnational governments</a> in the NDC update process and increase national and subnational climate ambition. In partnership with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, five regional workshops were hosted in five geographies: Medellín, Bogotá, Yopal, Cali and Barranquilla. The workshops were designed for a diverse set of subnational actors — including youth; women; and representatives from secretariats, local government, and Indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups — to create a more <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-subnational-governments-are-shaping-colombias-next-generation-climate-commitments/\">inclusive process for the country's updated NDC</a>.</p><p>This year, WRI Colombia and the country's Ministry of Housing hosted a workshop to identify implementation gaps for four measures in its NDC 2.0 that showed the least progress (two mitigation measures and two adaptation measures). During the workshop, key actions were prioritized to help overcome these barriers and define the next steps for 2026, 2028 and 2030.</p><p>In addition, WRI Colombia set up a Steering Committee with members from the Ministry of Housing, the National Planning Department and the Ministry of the Environment, as well as representatives from NGOs, multilateral development banks and subnational governments, to develop a shared understanding of urban challenges in the NDC 3.0 and how to address them.</p><p>On Sept. 25, Colombia submitted its <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/NDC%203.0%20Declarativa%20Colombia%20Transformaciones%20para%20la%20Vida%20V.25.09.2025%20Gob.%20Nacional.pdf\">\"declarative\" NDC 3.0</a>. This acknowledges the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-colombia-updates-its-climate-commitments-2035\">role of subnational governments</a> in planning and implementing climate mitigation and adaptation measures and promotes governance that integrates national and subnational perspectives.</p><h3>Rwanda</h3><p>In November 2024, WRI Africa, in close collaboration with the Rwandan Environment Management Authority (REMA) and the Ministry of Environment, organized a five-day, in-person workshop to surface district priorities for Rwanda's new NDC. The event brought together 130 participants representing all 30 of the country's districts — specifically, directors in charge of planning, agriculture and natural resources — to consolidate local and regional priorities and contribute to the national NDC enhancement process. The event was followed by a three-day, in-person validation workshop ensuring adequate capture of these priorities. Findings from the consultations were synthesized into a report and submitted to REMA to inform Rwanda's NDC 3.0.</p><p>Building on this foundation, in March 2025, WRI and ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability Africa supported REMA, the Ministry of Environment and the Rwandan Local Government Association to convene a policy dialogue with district vice mayors in charge of economic development. The dialogue aimed to strengthen political support for a whole-of-government approach to NDC implementation, fostering stronger coordination between national and subnational levels. WRI and partners also participated in a workshop with the Ministry of Environment and other key stakeholders to validate the draft NDC.</p><p>On Nov. 7, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-11/Rwanda%20NDC3.0.pdf\">Rwanda published its NDC 3.0</a>. This includes a higher mitigation target and a commitment to an economy-wide 53% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, relative to business as usual. The new NDC also emphasizes building capacity at the local level by investing in training and resources for districts, and calls for identifying and institutionalizing \"climate focal points\" in all 30 districts.</p><h3>Kenya</h3><p>WRI Africa, in partnership with the Financing Locally Led Climate Action (FLLoCA) program, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry (MECCF) and the Climate Change Directorate, organized a series of virtual meetings with climate change directors from all of Kenya's 47 counties. These consultations provided a platform to present Kenya's draft NDC 3.0 and gather feedback on how county-level climate priorities had been integrated into the national process.</p><p>In February 2025, WRI Kenya, in collaboration with C40 and the Global Covenant of Mayors, convened a CHAMP National Finance Accelerator Roundtable on the sidelines of the <a href=\"https://www.shiftcities.org/event/green-resilient-urbanshift-africa-forum-2025\">UrbanShift Forum</a> in Nairobi. This brought together key stakeholders to discuss opportunities for strengthening local access to climate finance and advancing multi-level collaboration on NDC implementation.</p><p>In May 2025, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-05/KENYAS%20SECOND%20NATIONALLY%20DETERMINED%20CONTRIBUTION%202031_2035.pdf\">Kenya submitted its NDC 3.0</a>, one of the earliest countries to do so.</p><p>On Oct. 28-29, WRI Kenya and the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate hosted a High-Level Convening to advance coordination, finance and implementation of Kenya's climate commitments under its new NDC. WRI Kenya, in collaboration with the Council of Governors (CoG), NDC Partnership (NDCP) and the Government of Kenya, will also convene two multistakeholder dialogues, focused on energy and transport and water and nature-based solutions, in November 2025.</p><h3>Ethiopia</h3><p>WRI Ethiopia held a high-level NDC 3.0 kickoff workshop in March 2025 in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and Development, sector ministries, NGOs, civil society organizations and the private sector. Following the workshop, WRI and the sector ministries also conducted a review of Ethiopia's NDC implementation to date. Building on this, WRI is further assessing implementation at the subnational level, with a case study focusing on Addis Ababa and a particular emphasis on the energy sector because of its relevance to the urban environment. WRI held an additional consultation workshop in early August to better understand how subnational elements of the new NDC might be implemented and produce practical suggestions for strengthening localization of the NDC.</p><p>Led by the Ministry of Planning and Development, and in consultation with the Ministry of Urban Development and Infrastructure and 30 local authorities, WRI also developed a greenhouse gas emissions estimation for Addis Ababa. The aim is to scale this to other cities, helping to emphasize the need for city-level investments in climate action.</p><p>In September 2025, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/Ethiopia%20NDC%203.0%20Final.pdf\">Ethiopia released its NDC 3.0</a>, which includes a 2035 mitigation target and revised, more ambitious mitigation, adaptation and financing targets in comparison to its last NDC. The new NDC commits to multilevel and multisectoral engagement and implementation to ensure broad ownership and alignment of climate action.</p><p><em>Editor's note: An update was made on Nov. 10, 2025 to reflect the release of Rwanda's NDC 3.0.</em></p>",

It requires at least 20% of the fund to go directly to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://forestclimateleaders.org/news-resources/governments-aim-to-collectively-recognise-160-million-hectares-of-indigenous-peoples-and-local-community-lands-in-tropical-forest-countr/\">Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment</a>, or ILTC, is a landmark commitment aimed at securing and legally recognizing 160 million hectares of land for Indigenous, Afro-descendants and local communities, and strengthening existing laws governing community land tenure. </li></ul><p>Together, these commitments signal a growing consensus that securing forest stewards’ land rights and access to finance is essential to safeguarding the planet’s climate and biodiversity.</p><h3>Why Land Rights and Finance Are Needed</h3><p>Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities steward <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fee.2148?ref=blog.aspiration.com\">more than one-third of the world’s intact forests and biodiversity areas</a> within their territories, and deforestation rates on these lands are <a href=\"https://rainforestfoundation.org/act-for-our-planet-before-its-too-late/\">up to 26%</a> lower than the global average. While <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">about 11%</a> of lands and forests globally are formally recognized as theirs, <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">at least 1.375 billion hectares</a> of their lands remain without legal recognition by national governments.</p><p>Without formal land rights, communities are often excluded from direct climate and forest financing. This happens because funds usually go to those who are legally registered as landowners, which is often the state rather than the forest communities themselves. From 2011 to 2024, <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/publication/state-of-funding-2025/\">less than 1%</a> of international climate financing reached programs that support Indigenous and community land tenure and management, and only a fraction of that went directly to community-led organizations. Of the $1.7 billion COP26 Forest Tenure Pledge, just over 10% <a href=\"https://landportal.org/library/resources/indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-forest-tenure-pledge-annual-report-2023\">reached Indigenous and community-led organizations</a> in 2023.</p><p>As a result, these communities often lack the resources needed to effectively protect forests from incursions, encroachments and land grabs, and to invest in land management practices that support global forest goals.</p><p>When the new COP30 finance commitments begin to flow, communities lacking formal land rights could again be left behind. Even proposals such as the TFFF, which allocates 20% of its funds for direct community access, may fall short if the funding delivery mechanism isn’t clearly defined.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A dust track with logs cut down on the side with a truck loaded with logs.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/logging-in-congo.jpg?VersionId=KP1q3usaQHEPv4IE6Z3Bv1FYr0Q.bKi5&itok=ZM2uz9dp\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Logging in Congo. The Forest Tenure Pledge, made at COP26 in 2021, aims to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030. Photo by Scott Thompson/WRI </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Recognizing Customary Forest Stewardship</h3><p>Many forest countries already recognize customary forest tenure, although the degree of recognition varies significantly. While these rights don’t grant full ownership, they can establish recognized forms of forest stewardship that can provide a foundation for communities to access financing and pave the way toward formal land titles.  </p><p>These forest tenure approaches typically include legitimacy vetting, geospatial mapping and recording in information registries, and documented conservation outcomes, which can serve as important building blocks to fulfill countries’ commitments under the ILTC and Pledge 2.0.</p><p>Here are several proven approaches to forest stewardship based on customary land tenure:</p><h4>Recognizing colonial-era or ancestral land grants </h4><p>Payments for ecosystem services, or PES, programs that pay landowners to maintain forest cover typically require formal land ownership. This often excludes many Indigenous and smallholder communities. But Guatemala’s PINPEP program (National Incentives Program for Small Landowners with a Forestry Vocation) provides a different approach: It allows <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-finance-access-indigenous-peoples-local-communities-payments-ecosystem-services\">participants to join the program</a> using verified colonial-era land grants and municipal certificates of possession in lieu of formal titles.</p><p>PINPEP recognizes verified customary possession and land use, allowing communities already protecting forests to access funds without undergoing the lengthy and costly process of getting formal land titles. The results are promising: An <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf602/pdf\">evaluation of Guatemala’s PES system</a> from 2007 to 2022 found a 3.4% drop in forest cover loss in Indigenous and smallholder forests under PINPEP, compared to a 1.6% increase in forest cover loss in forests under Guatemala’s PES program for titled landowners.</p><h4>Legal recognition of Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas   </h4><p>Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, or <a href=\"https://www.iccaregistry.org/en/about/iccas---territories-of-life\">ICCAs</a>, — also known as “Territories of Life” — are ecologically critical lands and waters governed and managed by Indigenous and rural communities based on their own customs, traditions and institutions. These lands recognize communities as collective stewards rather than private owners and provide a framework through which funding and conservation support can directly reach them.</p><p>These lands include sacred forests, community-managed forest areas, pastoral lands and coastal or marine regions that demonstrate positive conservation outcomes, even if conservation is not the primary objective. They are established by the communities themselves, based on deep historical and cultural connection to the area and their use of traditional land management systems. ICCAs are subject to peer review before being designated as such and recorded in the <a href=\"https://www.iccaregistry.org/en/about/icca-registry\">global ICCA Registry</a>.  </p><p>Many countries legally recognize ICCAs, and donors are increasingly supporting them. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/en/project/support-to-indigenous-peoples-and-community-conserved-areas-and-territories-iccas-13-iv-039-global-m-iccas-support/\">German International Climate Initiative</a>, or IKI, funded ICCA development in 45 countries, while <a href=\"https://wwfcastg.wwf.ca/media-releases/wwf-canada-announces-new-fund-for-indigenous-protected-and-conserved-areas/\">World Wildlife Fund-Canada</a> has established a fund to enable First Nations, Inuit and Métis Indigenous communities to create and manage their own protected areas.</p><h4>Recognizing long-term community forest management rights</h4><p>Many countries grant long-term forest management rights to state-owned forests. While forestland remains state property, communities gain exclusive rights to use, manage and protect it. This recognition allows them to participate directly in climate fund initiatives.</p><p>There are several examples of this in practice. Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/06/05/climate-action-game-changers-the-forest-story-from-indonesia\">social forestry program, or Perhutanan Sosial</a>, grants long-term permits of up to 35 years for local and customary communities to sustainably manage state forests. A <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/528/1/012037/pdf\">study spanning from 2007 to 2018</a> found that these areas saw a steady increase in primary forest and a decrease of secondary forest converted into non-forest areas. At the same time, local livelihoods and incomes rose by up to 92% in some regions.</p><p>Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the local community forest concessions program, or CFCL, <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/redd/news/detail/zh/c/1716893/\">grants customary communities</a> within or near national forest estates perpetual user rights to as much as 50,000 hectares of land. Since early 2024, more than 166 CFCLs have been granted, covering over 3 million hectares. A study found that CFCLs have up to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210107-congo-basin-a-bold-plan-to-save-africas-largest-rainforest\">23% lower deforestation rates</a> than the national average and 46% lower than logging concessions.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A man has his hands in the earth replanting a seedling.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/reforestation-in-indonesia_0.jpg?VersionId=DT1CIF.fDn_93xpua8KyOnOG_kXLS6E5&itok=Ke0x0NIR\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Community-led reforestation in Indonesia. These types of efforts help restore degraded forests and strengthen local stewardship of natural resources.

These and similar land-rights approaches offer a practical, high-impact pathway toward achieving the goals set under the new COP30 forest commitments.</p><p>The three forest commitments pledged during COP30 can be transformative, but only if they lead to action that puts land rights at the center. Ultimately, fully recognizing the rights of Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities to their lands is the only way to protect the world’s forests and our shared future.  </p><p>As COP30 sets the tone for the next phase of global climate action, securing land rights and unlocking finance for those who protect forests are two of the most strategic, effective and urgent investments the world can make.  </p><p> </p><p><em>This article was originally published on Oct. 21, 2025.

It includes a framework to boost wildfire resilience through science, policy and traditional and Indigenous knowledge. This Call to Action comes as fires drove record-breaking forest loss last year, according to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-global-forest-loss-shatters-records-2024-fueled-massive-fires\">Global Forest Watch analysis</a>.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement by Rod Taylor, Global Director for the Forest Program, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“We’re entering an alarming new era as fires became the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires\">leading cause of tropical primary forest loss</a> last year for the first time on record. This Call to Action signals that governments are waking up to the fact that preventing wildfires needs to be a top priority if they are to save the forests that underpin their economies.</p><p>“It's especially notable that civil society organizations from across the tropics and conservation groups have also <a href=\"https://www.tropenbos.org/tbi-cop30/\">signaled support for this Call to Action</a>.</p><p>“Climate-fueled conditions are driving more frequent and severe wildfires, which are often started by humans either to clear land for large-scale agriculture or as a traditional land management tool. From Brazil to Bolivia, fires surged across Latin America last year at a scale we haven’t seen in recent history.</p><p>“Governments should use this Call to Action to kickstart greater investments in fire prevention, early warning systems, and building resilient response approaches. Addressing wildfire risk needs to go hand-in-hand with slashing emissions that drive hotter and drier conditions.</p><p>“The framework’s commitment to involve Indigenous and local communities — among the world’s most <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">effective forest stewards</a> but <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/extreme-wildfires-growing-threat-and-call-support-indigenous-and-community-leadership\">disproportionately affected by wildfires</a> — in building fire management and prevention initiatives is all-important.

These pledges represent both a matter of justice for these communities, survival for our forests, and necessity for our climate goals.</p><p>“Research shows that when communities have secure land rights, forests flourish. Deforestation rates on lands stewarded by Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00815-2\">up to 26% lower</a> than the global average. These communities steward more than <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-and-local-community-land-rights-protect-biodiversity\">54% of the world’s intact forest</a>, and their lands often hold higher biodiversity and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">store more carbon</a>.</p><p>“Yet today communities lack legal recognition for <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">over 1.3 billion hectares</a> of their traditional lands, limiting their access to capital and decision-making power.

      "description": "<p>Amid record heat and worsening climate impacts on people’s lives, 2025 is a turning point for global climate action, as countries renew their climate commitments — known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — under the international Paris Agreement. This process reveals whether global ambition to tackle climate change is rising fast enough to meet the crisis head on.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Paris Agreement has delivered meaningful progress. Prior to the agreement, the world was hurtling toward <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming</a> by the end of the century. Ten years after the agreement’s adoption, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/assessing-2025-ndcs\">the latest NDCs</a> and current policies bring us closer to a <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2025\">2.3-2.8 degrees C</a> (4.1-5.0 degrees F) trajectory — modestly better than the previously projected <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024\">2.6-3.1 degrees C </a>(4.7-5.6 degrees F) path.</p><p>Yet even with this shift, we remain far above the 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) guardrail set by the Paris Agreement that can prevent some of the most serious damage from a warming planet. And while some sectors are showing real momentum — including the renewable energy, transport and land-use action reflected in many countries’ NDCs — overall progress is still dangerously slow.</p><p>Every fraction of a degree of warming the planet avoids helps secure a safer, greener future. And the investment required to achieve this is far less than the costs of the alternative path, which would bring increased floods, wildfires, insecure food supplies and destroyed lives.</p><p>At the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, nations must confront the gap between current climate pledges and what is needed to unlock a new economy that’s better for both people and the planet.</p><p>Here, we propose five key actions that countries can rally behind for a credible response:</p><ol><li>Reaffirm 1.5 degrees C and commission a global roadmap for ambition and implementation.</li><li>Accelerate near-term sectoral action to deliver 2030 global goals.</li><li>Mobilize long-term strategies for equitable, resilient transitions to net zero.</li><li>Strengthen intergovernmental initiatives for greater impact.</li><li>Deliver a credible finance package to back ambitious climate goals.</li></ol><p>With countries gathered under one roof, a clear political response will be needed that faces up to the shortfall in ambition and seizes the economic, social and other opportunities that assertive action can provide.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"506\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A sign advertising COP30.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/cop30-belem-brazil_0.jpg?VersionId=FMC6fXCGz6Wr11uocJMkOMWW0GI.q9vu&itok=n0yaO5sK\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>During the 2025 UN Climate Change Conference, countries will need to reaffirm their commitments and create climate plans that will bring the world closer to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree C goal.

As a starting point, COP30 should reaffirm that 1.5 degrees C remains the guiding star for global climate action. By doing so, it can send a clear political signal that the goal continues to be the benchmark for assessing progress toward achieving a healthy, livable and resilient world.</p><p>But underscoring those objectives alone will not be enough; COP30 will also need to spur implementation and drive ambition toward 1.5 degrees C in ways that ensure a just and inclusive transition. At COP30, countries could agree to develop a “<em>Global Roadmap for Accelerated Implementation”</em>— a forward-looking gameplan that identifies the pathways, policies and enabling conditions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.</p><p>The roadmap can draw on findings from the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/explaining-global-stocktake-paris-agreement\">Global Stocktake</a> and insights from the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/the-direction-of-travel-improving-every-year-but-we-need-to-urgently-pick-up-the-pace-un-climate\">NDC Synthesis Report</a> to identify specific near-term and transformational opportunities for accelerating emissions reductions across key sectors such as energy, forests, transport and methane, while scaling up adaptation, resilience and just transition efforts — with a particular emphasis on the tremendous economic, social and other benefits that can be seized from taking climate action.</p><p>To underpin this process, the COP30 and COP31 presidencies could convene a high-level dialogue, anchored by technical analysis, to examine how different pathways, timelines and investment conditions can shape an equitable, systemwide transformation. The process could culminate next year at COP31 with the publication of a clear, actionable roadmap that identifies opportunities for urgent action, the sectors with the greatest potential for impact and the actors best placed to drive it forward.</p><h3>2) <span>Accelerate Near-Term Sectoral Action to Deliver 2030 Global Goals </span></h3><p>Building on the roadmap for accelerated implementation, COP30 will also need to encourage countries to achieve near-term sectoral delivery by 2030. The task will involve translating collective signals from the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/explaining-global-stocktake-paris-agreement\">Global Stocktake</a> and the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma5_auv_8a_gga.pdf\">UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience</a> — along with the direction provided by the proposed global ambition and implementation roadmap mentioned above — into concrete economic planning, national policies and investments that can accelerate on-the-ground progress and deliver on the benefits of taking action.</p><p>At COP30, countries could be called upon to voluntarily develop near-term sectoral strategies and progress updates that translate and build upon their existing NDCs, turning national climate goals into concrete pathways for implementation. These strategies and updates could be submitted on a voluntary basis by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to inform the second Global Stocktake, which begins at the end of 2026 and concludes in 2028.</p><p>For the greatest impact, these strategies should be focused on the priority areas highlighted in the Global Stocktake for 2030 (e.g., tripling renewable energy capacity, doubling energy efficiency, transitioning away from fossil fuels, driving down transport emissions, and halting and reversing deforestation, among others), as well as the thematic areas of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience (e.g., water, health, ecosystems and biodiversity, and infrastructure).</p><p>While these global priorities are shared, their emphasis will naturally vary by country. Sectoral strategies can be used to set each country’s own specific plans, policies, investment priorities, support needs and enabling reforms needed to strengthen near-term actions. Most importantly, these strategies are a key opportunity to describe the actions that can seize the substantial benefits for the economy and people’s lives.</p><h3>3) Mobilize Long-Term Strategies for Equitable, Resilient Transitions to Net Zero</h3><p>Long-term climate strategies — or long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS or LTS) — are a critical bridge between NDCs and the collective objective to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Countries have already established 2030 targets and this round of NDCs sets emission-reduction targets through 2035, a key waypoint on the path to mid-century and the net zero goals set by many countries, most notably all of the Group of 20 major economies (G20). As countries move toward net zero, LT-LEDS allow them to outline key sectoral transformations and show how these steps can drive economic growth in the decades ahead, informing and spurring the policy decisions that governments take now.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>WRI COP30 Resource Hub</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"COP30 resource hub graphic.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/cop30-hub-preview_0.png?VersionId=gSWYoSpsmJpMuxUtgzYUWTpUeOAVwJ0E&itok=nRsU6JTv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">Watch our Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>Now more than ever, these strategies are essential for helping countries focus on the sectors that have a domino effect across the wider economy such as energy, food and agriculture, and transport. So far, nearly <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/lts-explore\">80 countries</a> have developed and submitted long-term strategies — but fewer than 10 have updated their initial plans, and more than 100 have yet to produce one.</p><p>COP30 can be a turning point, calling on all countries to submit or update LT-LEDS by COP31, treating the strategies not just as paperwork but as catalysts for real sectoral transformation, fully integrated into economic policies, development strategies and finance plans. G20 countries, in particular, should lead by example by developing implementation pathways that align their near-term goals (e.g., 2030 and 2035) with just transition toward their national net-zero and resilience goals. These pathways should also be integrated into national development objectives and processes.</p><h3>4) Strengthen Intergovernmental Initiatives for Greater Impact</h3><p>Throughout the year, the COP30 presidency has brought renewed attention and momentum to the <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/action-agenda\">Action Agenda</a> of initiatives outside the UNFCCC negotiations. Most important, it has sought to connect climate action initiatives and coalitions — including those involving national governments — to the formal COP process by aligning them with the themes of the first Global Stocktake on energy, forests, and more.</p><p>At COP30, there’s an important opportunity to place greater attention on the role of intergovernmental <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/assessing-intergovernmental-climate-initiatives-expectations-based-framework\">cooperative initiatives and coalitions</a> and integrate them more fully into the Action Agenda, which has previously focused on initiatives by non-state actors. The number of these initiatives and coalitions has grown rapidly in recent years, and governments should now explore their impact and lessons.    </p><p>COP30 can also play an important role in fostering transparency for these intergovernmental initiatives and coalitions, encouraging and driving regular reporting, including through the UNFCCC <a href=\"https://climateaction.unfccc.int/\">Global Climate Action Portal</a>.  During future COPs, dedicated events can allow these initiatives to share their successes, experiences, lessons and best practices.</p><h3>5) Deliver a Credible Finance Package to Back Ambitious Climate Goals</h3><p>Delivering a strong package of finance outcomes at COP30 will signal that the support needed to turn ambition into action is within reach. This includes progress on the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/workstreams/baku-to-belem-roadmap-to-13t\">Baku-to-Belém Roadmap</a> — a collective pathway for scaling climate finance for developing countries from all sources through 2035 — which can spur action on key issues such as the cost of capital. Such progress would send a powerful signal that international public and private finance will flow to countries that step up ambition and translate this into strong domestic finance and public policy signals.</p><p>A key signal at COP30 would be the creation and further strengthening of country platforms as a way to align domestic and international finance, facilitate an enabling policy environment for investment across key sectors, develop investible pipelines, engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders and optimize the use of concessional finance to de-risk projects and unlock capital flows. This way, countries can integrate proposed climate plans into broader economic frameworks and promote an enabling environment for all finance flows to support progress towards climate commitments while strengthening countries’ development pathways.</p><h3>Building an Actionable Future</h3><p>The gaps are clear, but so is the opportunity for getting closer to the goals of the Paris Agreement. COP30 gathers the world’s leaders armed with the tools to close the emissions and ambition gaps. What’s needed now is bold political action and a strong response to the NDCs to restore confidence in multilateralism, set the world more firmly on course to achieve climate goals and ensure shared prosperity from taking that action. The legacy of the Belém COP will rest in large measure on doing so. </p>",
