      "description": "<p>In a year marked by escalating climate impacts, economic headwinds, climate policy rollbacks and a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape, the road to the 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) has been shaped by uncertainty and urgency. At the same time, the significant uptick of renewable energy in many countries signals important opportunities for progress.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p>This article was written with input from the consortium Allied for Climate Transformation by 2025 (ACT2025), a group of experts and thought leaders from climate-vulnerable countries working to drive greater climate ambition on the international stage. Learn more about ACT2025 and its work <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/allied-climate-transformation-act2025\">here</a>.</p></div><p>While countries — including the most <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/allied-climate-transformation-act2025/resources/g20-learn-ndcs-climate-vulnerable-nations\">vulnerable</a> — update their climate plans known as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs), the world is still collectively off track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). And the cost of falling short is already clear. Vulnerable communities worldwide are shouldering mounting death tolls from extreme weather events, <a href=\"https://api.internal-displacement.org/sites/default/files/publications/documents/idmc-grid-2025-global-report-on-internal-displacement.pdf\">disaster-induced internal displacement</a>, and the disruption of global supply chains leading to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y\">food insecurity</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36626833/\">reduced healthcare access</a>. Tight global financing conditions and rising debt distress are systemic issues making matters worse.</p><p>That’s not just a problem for climate-vulnerable countries: The impacts of climate change, undeterred by borders, will have direct and knock-on effects that will reverberate throughout the global economy and society.</p><p>That is why COP30 is at a critical crossroads. Failure to deliver strong outcomes risks exacerbating vulnerable countries’ exposure to climate hazards, losing critical development gains, deepening inequality, and further eroding trust in international cooperation and diplomacy.</p><p>On the other hand, climate action can provide important benefits for vulnerable countries, as we’ve seen with <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/allied-climate-transformation-act2025/resources/mitigation-spotlight-caribbean\">solar water heaters</a> reducing household energy bills in Barbados, improved air quality in Nepal and Ethiopia with <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/768768/ethiopia-nepal-surprising-ev-boom/\">increased EV uptake</a>, and more resilient agriculture across Africa. This year’s summit will be a vital test to find consensus, raise collective ambition, and turn it into real-world action and support.</p><p>COP30 is set on the edge of the Amazon with the Brazilian presidency highlighting a renewed focus on <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/latin-american-forests-are-vital-to-the-climate-crisis-response\">ending forest loss</a>, boosting climate finance and turning negotiations into action — <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub/key-issues\">all vital</a> for climate-vulnerable countries. But will it deliver? For vulnerable countries, the stakes could not be higher. </p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>WRI COP30 Resource Hub</strong></p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"COP30 resource hub graphic.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/cop30-hub-preview_0.png?VersionId=gSWYoSpsmJpMuxUtgzYUWTpUeOAVwJ0E&itok=nRsU6JTv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n</a><p class=\"secondary\">WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">Watch our Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>Attention now turns to the issues that will shape success or failure. At COP30, the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/allied-climate-transformation-act2025\">ACT2025 consortium</a>, a coalition of experts and thought leaders who amplify the voices of climate-vulnerable developing nations in climate negotiations, will be actively participating and watching how the summit responds to four critical questions:</p><h3>1) With the 1.5 Degree C Threshold Under Threat, What Does that Mean for COP30?</h3><p>After a flurry of announcements in September, over 60 countries have now submitted new national climate plans. But <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">analysis</a> shows the numbers aren’t adding up. So far, collective ambition falls short of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).</p><p>At a moment when political will is waning, COP30 must deliver a political response to this ambition gap by acknowledging <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/1-5-degrees-c-target-explained\">the 1.5 degree C goal is in grave jeopardy</a> and emphasizing the need for major emitters, including all developed and G20 countries, to increase ambition before 2030 (recognizing they <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\">have the technological and financial tools to do so</a>). This means taking forward the Global Stocktake goals to triple renewables, double energy efficiency, transition away from fossil fuels, halt forest loss, scale-up sustainable transport and more. Leaders must demonstrate, for example at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, how they will go above and beyond current commitments to urgently align with what the science demands.</p><p>At the same time, COP30 should welcome and encourage strengthened commitments, <a href=\"https://www.iddri.org/en/publications-and-events/working-paper/paris10-diagnosis-looking-back-look-forward\">celebrate the decade of progress since the Paris Agreement</a>, and provide a forward-looking vision grounded in implementation, transparency and accountability. NDCs cannot be treated as stand-alone documents — they must be aligned with long-term strategies, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), and sectoral pathways in energy, transport, land use and industry that deliver real-world, whole-of-society transformation. Climate plans must also address the dual challenges of mitigation and adaptation, ensuring that pathways reflect equity by addressing both the urgent need to cut emissions and the pressing realities of climate impacts faced by vulnerable communities.</p><p>It was climate-vulnerable countries, in particular small island developing states (SIDS), who pushed for the Paris Agreement to include the more ambitious stretch goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. They remain its guardians — the moral compass of the negotiations and the defenders of a target that is critical to their survival. We can expect their steely determination to not let it slide.</p><p>Although <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/state-of-the-climate-2024-sets-a-new-record-as-the-first-year-above-1-5c/\">Earth exceeded 1.5 degrees C of warming in 2024</a>, this threshold is not like flipping a switch — it’s more like adjusting a thermostat. Every fraction of a degree matters, and strong, consistent changes make the difference between staying within safe limits or not. The fight is not lost, but recovery depends on immediate and decisive action. </p><h3>2) How Can Real Progress on Climate-Vulnerable Countries’ Priorities Be Made During COP30 Negotiations?</h3><p>Making progress across three issues  will be critical:</p><h4>Following up on implementation of the new climate finance goal</h4><p>For vulnerable developing countries, the quantity and quality of financial support for the implementation of climate action has <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/chapter/chapter-15/\">important long-term catalytic benefits</a>, making accelerated and timely delivery of support from developed countries essential. Overall success at COP30 hinges on whether the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ncqg-climate-finance-goals-explained\">New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance</a> (NCQG) can springboard a financial response that includes public grant-based and other highly concessional instruments, without worsening unsustainable debt burdens, and that mobilizes quality private investment, especially for climate-vulnerable developing nations. Formal and informal negotiations must focus on clarifying how to accelerate the implementation of the NQCG to deliver at least $300 billion and its upscaling to $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with developed countries taking the lead and with clear signals on how to triple financial flows of the multilateral climate funds (from 2022 levels by 2030). For climate-vulnerable nations, this level of finance is essential to implement climate plans and turn targets into concrete action. </p><p>The Baku to Belém Roadmap to $1.3 trillion will be an important delivery vehicle in this regard, as it can help establish strong interlinkages and synergies with ongoing initiatives outside the UNFCCC regime on sovereign debt issues, reforms of international financial institutions including multilateral development banks (MDBs), as well as innovative instruments such as solidarity levies to holistically deliver for climate action. For climate-vulnerable countries, it is important for the Roadmap to be in line with the purpose of the NCQG (i.e. to support implementation of developing countries’ climate plans, contribute to increasing and accelerating ambition, and reflect the evolving needs and priorities of developing countries); provide guidance on scaling up grant-based public finance for adaptation, resilience and addressing loss and damage; and that sufficient transparency and accountability arrangements are embedded. </p><h4>Enhancing finance and tracking for adaptation </h4><p>Finalizing how the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-goal-on-adaptation-explained\">Global Goal on Adaptation</a> (GGA) will be put into action will be front-and-center at COP30. First, countries are likely to adopt a set of indicators to track progress towards the achievement of the GGA and its framework targets, which span different sectors and the adaptation policy cycle. </p><p>These indicators go beyond technical assessment — they can offer a more granular and harmonized catalogue of adaptation and resilience action and support, nudging greater alignment and transparency across sectors for governments, businesses and financial actors. A top priority for climate-vulnerable nations will be ensuring the final set of indicators includes those that adequately track delivery of quality finance, capacity building and technology support. This is important for effective implementation of the GGA and its framework targets.</p><p>Second, countries must determine what’s next for adaptation finance given that the <a href=\"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NWPStaging/News/Pages/Adaptation-at-the-forefront-of-COP-26-outcomes-in-Glasgow.aspx\">Glasgow pledge</a> to double adaptation finance (from 2019 levels) expires this year. This could be through a new goal on adaptation finance, new pledges and fund replenishments (in particular to the Adaptation Fund), as well as MDB commitments to invest in adaptation and climate resilience in vulnerable countries.</p><p>Despite the notable progress since the Glasgow goal was adopted in 2021, adaptation remains underfunded, with the current <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024\">adaptation finance gap estimated at up to $359 billion per year</a>. There is a risk that adaptation finance may stagnate without deliberate prioritization and delivery; countries are calling for this to be addressed, for example by <a href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2025/06/24/bonn-bulletin-developing-nations-call-for-adaptation-finance-to-triple-by-2030/\">tripling adaptation finance</a> from 2022 levels by 2030 or through a new needs-based goal to respond to the evolving adaptation needs of developing countries as expressed in the IPCC assessments, the Global Stocktake outcome, and NDCs and NAPs.  </p><p>Combining increased financial flows with more effective tracking of adaptation action can help enhance incentives for high-impact investments in adaptation and provide a clearer picture of overall progress. In other words, better tracking could raise global standards for adaptation finance and help ensure funds drive meaningful domestic action where they are most needed. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-adaptation-investment-case\">investing in climate resilience and adaptation</a> strengthens national economies and human security by protecting infrastructure, securing food and water systems, and reducing climate-related shocks. Accelerating progress will require not only tracking but also that adaptation and resilience are embedded within broader national planning and investment strategies across sectors. </p><h4>Building a coherent architecture for loss and damage solutions</h4><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loss-damage-climate-change\">Loss and damage</a> action and financing have received less attention ahead of COP30, but they remain key priorities for climate-vulnerable developing countries. There is urgent need for further capitalization of the recently created Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD) with sufficient and predictable resources beyond current pledges. To best support countries, the FRLD should prioritize non-debt-inducing financial instruments, direct access modalities by national entities via simplified application procedures, and expedited funding for the urgent needs of vulnerable countries.</p><p>Additionally, sustaining the <a href=\"https://www.santiago-network.org/\">Santiago Network</a> (which provides technical assistance for the implementation of averting, minimize and addressing loss and damage) through the provision of adequate support is essential to delivering technical assistance on loss and damage —with about $40 million in pledged funding available, the Santiago Network is ready to receive and approve more technical assistance requests. COP30 must mobilize funding to ensure the Santiago Network can continue operating, respond to country requests and expand its regional presence. COP30 must also use the third review of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) to align and strengthen coordination between the WIM, FRLD, Santiago Network and national mechanisms. This is a critical opportunity to establish a coherent, responsive, and rights-based global loss and damage architecture—and it must not be missed. Doing so urgently will prompt solutions-driven dialogues that are more meaningfully driven by the voices of climate-vulnerable nations.</p><h3>3) Will Multilateralism Hold Strong at COP30?</h3><p>For climate-vulnerable countries to have the best chance of achieving strong results, they must have an equal seat at the table — an essential characteristic of the UNFCCC. In addition to increasing attacks on multilateralism and international cooperation, vulnerable countries are also affected by the fact that they have fewer financial and technical resources at their disposal to devote to international climate change decision-making and engagement. Delegations, for example from least developed countries and SIDS, are often fewer in number compared to those of developed countries. The <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/preparations-for-cop30-advance-as-79-countries-confirm-accommodation\">high cost of accommodation in Belém</a> is further creating a logistical headache, putting climate-vulnerable country representation under even more pressure. Ensuring adequate and meaningful representation is itself a test of the inclusiveness and fairness of COP30.</p><p>Nevertheless, the defense of climate multilateralism is key to the Brazilian presidency’s approach to COP30. With the U.S. government’s announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and many donor countries slashing overseas development aid, climate-vulnerable countries are looking for signals that global cooperation remains a priority. Reaffirming multilateralism at COP30 can help rebuild trust by accelerating the implementation of the Paris Agreement and connecting climate action to the real needs and efforts of people on the ground. In doing so, collective action will drive transformative change that leaves no one behind.</p><h3>4) What Impact Will the Recent ICJ Ruling Have on COP30?</h3><p>In July 2025, after a multi-year campaign initiated by Vanuatu and supported by vulnerable countries and communities, youth groups and allies worldwide, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, issued an unprecedented and unanimous <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/187\">advisory opinion on the obligations of states in respect of climate change</a>. The UN’s principal judicial body ruled that states have an obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions and act with due diligence and cooperation to fulfill this duty. The ruling also reinforced that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) is, de facto, the global goal to strive for and it is not optional.</p><p>Countries have a chance to meet the bar set by the ICJ, which emphasized that national climate commitments should reflect their highest ambition possible. High-emitting countries will face increasing moral and legal pressure as a result of the ruling. It gives vulnerable developing countries a potential new tool for holding major polluters to account, and it also emphasizes the duty of cooperation, particularly in terms of financing, technology transfer and support. The COP30 outcome could integrate these messages from the ICJ ruling. </p><h3>COP30 Is Our Chance to Course-Correct</h3><p>As we navigate the intricate landscape of global climate action in 2025, ramping up ambition and scaling support for implementation is imperative. This year’s outcomes must be decisive in establishing a robust global framework capable of addressing the multi-faceted challenges of climate change effectively.</p><p>Governments must use COP30 as an opportunity to catch up with the world’s rapidly changing realities. The task is urgent: The world must move further and faster to ensure the most vulnerable countries, communities and people can build their own resilience — not only to survive, but to thrive. Time is a critical resource we cannot replenish, and for climate vulnerable countries, it’s fast running out.</p>",

      "description": "<p>When Alex Tawiah and Georgina Nyarko first heard about beekeeping on their cocoa farm, they were skeptical. Could bees really help them earn a steady income?  </p><p>They put their misgivings aside and decided to work with Goshen Global Vision, a non-profit that helps small farmers build sustainable livelihoods. With training and a small investment, the couple installed eight beehives on their land. They also worked to plant and protect native trees. While many farmers clear natural vegetation to make space for more cocoa plants, Goshen explained that bees need trees for food and shelter, and the shade they provide can even help cocoa trees thrive.</p><p>A year later, the hives have brought so much more than honey to the small cocoa farm.</p><p>Alex and Georgina now earn extra money from harvesting and selling honey from their hives. Bees help pollinate  their cocoa trees, while on-farm trees add nutrients to the soil. The two combined have helped increase the couple’s cocoa yields, further boosting incomes.  </p><p>“I was weary of keeping bees in the farm due to the safety risks it posed to our children who accompany us,” said Nyarko. “But we were assured of protective clothing for safe apiculture. This was a good decision.” Today, Alex and Georgina’s land is part of a growing agroforestry movement across Ghana’s Cocoa Belt. By preserving and planting trees alongside cocoa, farmers are not only restoring degraded land; they’re creating more resilient farms and new income streams.</p><article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJeF2Z72_b4\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch From Cocoa Tree to Chocolate: Learn how Ghanaian Farmers are Ensuring Sustainability of Cocoa\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Ghana’s Cocoa Economy at a Crossroads</h3><p>Ghana is the world’s second-largest cocoa exporter, <a href=\"https://ghana-cocoa-belt-worldresources.hub.arcgis.com/pages/instructions\">bringing in over <strong>$2.2 billion a year</strong></a><strong>. </strong>But much of that success has come at the expense of the country’s forests.</p><p>Between 2001 and 2017, <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/GHA/\">illegal cocoa farming stripped away more than <strong>13% of Ghana’s forest cover</strong></a>. Without trees to hold soil in place, wind and rain washed away nutrient-rich topsoil. Crop yields dropped, deepening poverty.</p><p>These compounding problems further strained forests and the farmers who relied on them.  “Most times [people] need money, they go to the forest and then they cut the native species and hunt for game,” said <strong>Mary Perpetua Kwakuyi</strong>, executive director of Goshen Global Vision. For example, farmers facing dwindling crop yields sometimes cut trees and sell the timber or charcoal to make ends meet. “Restoration without livelihood is just a conversation,” Kwakuyi said.</p><p>In other words: People don’t destroy forests because they want to; they do it because they have no alternative.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Women with watering cans.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/women-pado_0.jpg?VersionId=l0jpfxNp7qyfOFR010uzrQTMx50mLTEB&itok=mp87eYMK\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Women with the Private Afforestation Development Organization (PADO) water young plants in Ghana’s Cocoa Belt.

Once considered an afterthought, agroforestry is now central to Goshen’s work in Ghana’s Western Region. The organization trains local farmers to grow trees, maintain hives and harvest honey.

The same week, the Department of the Interior said it would open <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-unleashes-american-coal-power-bold-move-advance-trump-administration\">13.1 million acres</a> of federal land to coal mining, while the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-repeal-biden-harris-epa-regulations-power-plants-which-if-finalized-would\">proposed</a> weakening regulations meant to limit toxic water and air pollution from coal plants.</p><p>These are the latest in a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-625-million-investment-reinvigorate-and-expand-americas-coal#:~:text=100%25%20natural%20gas.-,Background%3A,-To%20date%2C%20the\">series of maneuvers</a> intended to shore up U.S. coal in the face of rising energy costs, reliability concerns and growing power demand (not least from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">new data centers</a>).</p><p>Yet, coal is not an economical answer to energy security. Evidence shows that keeping old plants online is <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies_Cost-of-Federal-Mandates-to-Retain-Fossil-Burning-Power-Plants.pdf#page=6\">already costing utilities millions</a> — costs that are passed onto ratepayers. While these plants might bolster power supply in the short term, they will ultimately drive up electricity bills, hurt Americans' health and accelerate dangerous climate change.</p><p>The good news is that there are cleaner, more reliable sources available today that can meet the country's rising demand more affordably.</p><h3>Coal Has Declined as Cheaper, Cleaner Power Sources Emerged</h3><p>Two decades ago, nearly half the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,0,1&fuel=vtvv&geo=g&sec=g&linechart=ELEC.GEN.GEO-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.TSN-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.BIO-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.SUN-US-99.A&columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A&map=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A&freq=A&start=2005&end=2024&chartindexed=0&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&columnvalues=0&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0\">United States</a>' electricity came from coal. Today, only about 15% does.</p><p>The single biggest reason for this shift is that other power sources became more competitive. <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/the_effect_of_fuel_prices_environmental_regulations_and_other_factors_on_u.s._coal_productions_2008-2016.pdf\">Natural gas prices fell</a> relative to coal as the U.S. ramped up shale gas production, making coal plants less economic. This helped accelerate momentum <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/what-killing-us-coal-industry\">away from coal and toward natural gas</a> around the early 2010s. Protective environmental and climate regulations have also made it more expensive to operate highly polluting coal plants.</p><p>In tandem, plummeting renewable prices over the last decade and state policies encouraging adoption led to rapid clean energy deployment. Wind and solar <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-and-solar-overtook-coal-on-the-us-grid-in-2024\">overtook coal</a> in the U.S. power mix for the first time in 2024, together contributing 17% of the country's electricity compared to coal's 15%.</p><p>Critically, these sources are not just cheaper than coal, but also cleaner and safer. Coal is the <a href=\"https://understand-energy.stanford.edu/energy-resources/fossil-fuel-energy/coal\">most carbon-intensive fossil fuel</a> and emits toxic pollutants that can lead to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-172/pdfs/2011-172.pdf\">lung disease and other health risks</a>. One study attributed nearly <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37995235/\">half a million</a> deaths in the U.S. between 1999 and 2020 to coal plant pollution.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25531422/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Keeping Coal Plants Online Will Hike Electricity Bills</h3><p>The federal government's recent measures are aimed at recommissioning coal plants that have been taken offline and extending the life of existing plants. Similarly, an April <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-the-reliability-and-security-of-the-united-states-electric-grid/\">executive order</a> directed DOE to evaluate processes for using its emergency powers to improve grid reliability. As a result of this order, the agency has taken action to keep fossil fuel plants slated for retirement in operation, including the <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open\">J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-constellation-pjm-emergency-eddystone/749520/\">Eddystone oil- and gas-burning plant in Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>These measures come at a steep price. With spending needed on retrofits and upgrades, the cost of coal power is rising as aging plants become more expensive to operate and maintain. This means that keeping old plants open can be costly. Consumers Energy — the majority owner of the J.H. Campbell power station that was ordered to remain online past its May 2025 retirement date — <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000201533/000081115625000071/cms-20250630.htm\">reported that it spent $29 million</a> in the first 38 days of a DOE order to keep the plant open. At this rate, the cost to keep it running is estimated to be about $279 million a year.</p><p>Rising generation costs ultimately translate to higher rates for electricity customers, contributing to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/16/nx-s1-5502671/electricity-bill-high-inflation-ai\">surging energy bills</a> for U.S. households and businesses. One recent report estimates that efforts to prevent large fossil fuel power plants from retiring could <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/document/report-the-cost-of-federal-mandates-to-retain-fossil-burning-power-plants\">cost ratepayers about $3.1 billion a year</a> by the end of 2028.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25546913/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>There Are Better Ways to Meet US Power Demand</h3><p>More coal is not the answer to today's energy challenges. What the U.S. needs to keep prices down, meet rising demand and stay competitive on a global scale is: <em>1) </em>to build wind, solar and batteries rapidly now, because they are the quickest to install and least expensive source of energy in many regions; and <em>2)</em> to scale up clean, firm power — a variety of low-carbon sources, including next-generation geothermal, nuclear and hydropower, that can operate around the clock.</p><p>Investing in clean energy today makes good financial sense. The cost of building new renewables <a href=\"https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus-lcoeplus/\">can be less than operating coal</a>; indeed, research has shown that the majority of U.S. coal plants would be <a href=\"https://energyinnovation.org/report/the-coal-cost-crossover-3-0/\">more expensive to continue running</a> than to replace with local wind or solar. Scaling these sources will also be key to supporting the administration's goal of \"energy dominance\" in a world that's <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2025/executive-summary\">increasingly investing in renewables</a>.</p><p>Despite current headwinds, including the early phase-out of key federal tax credits, U.S. wind and solar are still expected to grow in the coming years. In its latest <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-july-2025\">energy infrastructure report</a>, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forecasts that the U.S. will add 92.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar and 22.6 GW of new wind between August 2025 and July 2028 — enough to power more than 25 million homes. It also forests that no <em>new</em> coal will be built over this period, while 25 GW of existing coal capacity and 13.7 GW of natural gas capacity are set to retire.</p><p>There are also opportunities to ramp up investment in clean power sources beyond wind and solar and to increase the efficiency of the grid. Technologies such as nuclear and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/next-generation-geothermal-energy-explained\">advanced geothermal</a> already benefit from bipartisan support in Congress and could potentially represent a significant percentage of the country's future energy mix. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/advanced-transmission-technologies-us-power-grid\">new transmission technologies</a> can help modernize the aging grid and increase its efficiency, helping to move more power along existing lines and accommodate rapidly growing demand.</p><p>Now is the time to make smart, forward-looking investments in energy that's safe, affordable, reliable and abundant — rather than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/10/07/white-house-fossil-fuel-concierge/\">clinging to systems of the past</a> that will raise costs for consumers.</p>",

As Southeast Asia’s largest economy and one of the few developing countries in the G20, Indonesia’s energy transition carries both regional and global significance, as it can serve as a model for other emerging economies.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-ID\">The study’s “JETP scenario” projects that new clean and efficient energy investments would drive 8% GDP growth while also reducing emissions. Power sector emissions are projected to peak at</span> 324 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2034 and then <span lang=\"EN-ID\">drop sharply </span>to 13.2 MtCO2e by 2050 — nearly six times lower than what emissions would be under a business-as-usual scenario — a reduction of more than<span> </span><span lang=\"EN-ID\">90%. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-ID\">Crucially, the benefits go well beyond curbing emissions. The study also finds that:</span> </p><ul><li><span lang=\"EN-ID\">Every US$1 billion invested in renewable energy is projected to generate US$1.41 billion in economic returns, creating new value chains in clean energy installation, operation and maintenance.</span></li><li><span lang=\"EN-ID\">More than 2.8 million jobs could be created in renewable energy construction and power generation.</span></li><li><span lang=\"EN-ID\">O</span>il imports could fall by 1.23 million barrels per day, <span lang=\"EN-ID\">bolstering </span>Indonesia's energy independence and resilience to global fuel price shocks.  </li><li><span lang=\"EN-ID\">Renewable energy deployment would also bring major</span> public health <span lang=\"EN-ID\">benefits. It would significantly cut dangerous air pollution, lower healthcare costs and boost </span>worker productivity. WRI’s modeling shows that meeting Indonesia’s clean energy goals could save up to 62,000 lives per year compared with a business-as-usual pathway. </li></ul><p><span lang=\"EN-ID\">“The study gives policymakers a strong case to act now on Indonesia’s just energy transition,” <strong>said Egi Suarga, Senior Manager for Climate, WRI Indonesia</strong>. “It shows that clean energy doesn't impede prosperity — it drives it.

      "description": "<p>Countries today face a fundamental challenge: how to grow their economies and meet development goals without repeating the planet-warming patterns of the past.</p><p>Historically, rapid economic growth has come at the cost of high greenhouse gas emissions. As the world works to secure a stable climate and safe future, decoupling the two is essential — particularly for emerging economies in places like southeast Asia, where energy demand and emissions are rising fast.</p><p>This challenge comes into sharp focus in Indonesia, which stands at a defining moment. Southeast Asia's largest economy and the world's fourth-most-populous country has two ambitious goals: to grow its GDP 8% per year by 2029 and reach net-zero emissions by 2060.</p><p>These objectives may seem to be at odds — and if the country continues on its current fossil-powered trajectory, they are. But this isn't the only way.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition\">New WRI research</a> shows that Indonesia can achieve both climate<em> and</em> economic goals if it doubles down on clean energy and energy efficiency in the coming years. While the upfront investment is significant, the payoff is even greater: not just lower emissions, but also millions of new jobs, stronger energy security, cleaner air and better health.</p><p>These findings align with a <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2020.1724070\">growing body of research</a> that shows climate action can grow economies while improving lives globally. Indonesia now has the opportunity to demonstrate that, with the right policies and decisive action, clean energy can be key to a more prosperous future.</p><h3>Modeling a Path to Green Growth</h3><p>At present, Indonesia's energy needs are largely <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/indonesia/energy-mix\">met by fossil fuels</a>: 36% of its power came from coal and 26% from oil in 2023. Raising GDP 8% per year by 2029 would massively ramp up demand, particularly as the government prioritizes energy-intensive industries such as nickel, iron and steel. Meeting this growing demand with the country's current carbon-intensive power mix risks rapidly driving up emissions.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25514396/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In parallel to its economic goals, Indonesia has set out plans to shift away from fossil energy and toward clean power. Its latest Electricity Supply Business Plan (<em>Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik</em>, or RUPTL) aims to expand renewable power to 34.3% of the total power mix by 2034. The country is also part of a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), which aims to mobilize $20 billion in international finance to support this transition. However, Indonesia is not on track to meet its clean energy goals and has even revised its renewable energy targets downward in recent years.</p><p>Our research sought to answer a key question: What if the country pursued its economic goals and an ambitious energy transition in tandem?</p><div class=\"report-teaser gold-borders-medium alignright\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"2227\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1782\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1365\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"1075\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Understanding the Socioeconomic Implications of Indonesia’s Net Zero Energy Transition covershot\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition_0.jpg?VersionId=0mhwO5V8ooeG9yEueBo1.h0l1Ww0lZOk&itok=CDz9JULe\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"text-wrapper\"><div class=\"h4 topic-tag\">Understanding the socioeconomic implications of Indonesia's net-zero energy transition </div><p><a class=\"button small\" href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition\">Download</a></p></div></div><p>Building on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/zero-emissions-increasing-climate-ambition-indonesia\">earlier modeling</a> that informed Indonesia's net-zero goal, we looked at what would happen if the country increased clean energy and energy efficiency as outlined under its JETP agreement. Laid out in the 2023 Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP), this pathway includes retiring two fossil fuel power plants by 2035; achieving 34% renewable energy by 2030; and implementing energy efficiency measures. (These could include measures like introducing minimum energy performance standards and labeling programs that promote energy-saving appliances, and improving motor-driven factory equipment and industrial machinery to reduce power consumption.)</p><p>Under this \"JETP scenario,\" new clean energy and improved energy efficiency would still deliver enough power to drive 8% GDP growth per year — while also reducing emissions and avoiding the environmental, health and fiscal costs that come with fossil fuel dependence.</p><p>With continued green energy investment, power sector emissions would peak in 2034 at about 324 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) and drop to just 13.2 MtCO2e by 2050 — consistent with Indonesia's goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2060. By contrast, under a business-as-usual scenario, power sector emissions would rise to 1.86 billion tonnes by 2050 — nearly six times what the sector emitted in 2022.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3348267/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Data</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Our analysis used an adaptation of the Indonesia Vision to 2045 (IV2045) model — developed under the country's <a href=\"https://lcdi-indonesia.id/\">Low Carbon Development Initiative</a> — to simulate high economic growth pathways either under existing energy systems or more efficient, low-carbon ones.

Our study finds that scaling up renewables in Indonesia can help the country achieve a bevy of economic and development goals.</p><h4>Clean energy investments can drive big economic returns.</h4><p>Scaling up renewable energy will require significant upfront investments in new infrastructure, such as wind turbines, solar farms and battery storage systems. However, the anticipated returns make this spend worthwhile. Our research shows that renewable energy investments in Indonesia can deliver a projected return of $1.41 billion for every $1 billion invested.</p><p>The more Indonesia invests in renewables, the more it will generate demand — and thereby additional investment — for them. This can create new value chains for the installation and maintenance of renewable energy systems, spurring significant job creation and contributing to GDP gains.</p><p>In addition, upfront deployment costs would be offset in the long term by the much lower operation and maintenance costs of renewable facilities compared to fossil fuel plants. And a greater supply of renewables can generate additional economic returns by keeping workers healthier and more productive through cleaner air.</p><p>International partners under Indonesia's JETP will help provide early financial support for this infrastructure. But the total investment required to meet the country's targets far exceeds the $20 billion committed under the partnership, meaning the country will need to secure significant additional funding in the near-term from the government, private sector and international sources.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Workers clean and inspect solar panels on a rooftop.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/indonesia-solar-panel-maintenance.jpg?VersionId=v_1Plq5kGpgZuGK4I8EiZyE0EsbC8B4p&itok=QPqxNLH1\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Engineering students inspect rooftop solar panels in Bali, Indonesia.

According to our model, JETP investments are projected to lead to an additional 52.2 GW of on-grid renewable power and transmission infrastructure by 2030. This massive build-out would create 383,000 new jobs in the energy sector this decade, including roles such as solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the country could add almost 1 million total jobs in renewable energy construction and another 1.8 million in power generation by 2050. These would come from the scale up of not just wind and solar, but also hydropower, geothermal and nuclear power plants by 2034, as well as the introduction of green hydrogen in 2040.</p><p>While the net job gains are huge, this transition would also see 51,300 workers displaced from fossil fuel plants. Reskilling programs will be critical to help these workers transition into new, green job opportunities.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25340802/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Shifting away from fossil fuels can bolster energy security.</h4><p>Indonesia's domestic oil production has been in decline since 1997, increasing the country's reliance on imported oil to meet national energy demand. This is at odds with the country's goal of becoming more <a href=\"https://setkab.go.id/en/president-subianto-sets-strategic-plan-for-national-energy-independence-and-targeted-subsidies-in-high-level-meeting/\">energy independent</a>, as imported fossil fuels are vulnerable to global price shocks and supply disruptions. It's also expensive: <a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/business/indonesia-considers-doubling-us-crude-lpg-imports-to-offset-tariffs\">In 2024 alone</a>, Indonesia spent over US$36 billion on imported crude oil and natural gas.</p><p>Shifting to renewable energy would help lower this import dependence. In our JETP scenario, oil imports drop significantly as renewables scale up, saving 1.23 million barrels per day by 2050. In addition to limiting exposure to international market risks, this shift would free up public resources previously spent on oil imports and fossil fuel subsidies — funds that could be redirected to domestic energy infrastructure and other development priorities.</p><p>Moreover, increased reliance on clean electricity as opposed to fossil fuels could expedite the shift to electric transportation; a transition already well underway, with ambitions to <a href=\"https://itdp.org/2024/07/15/building-momentum-for-transport-electrification-in-indonesia/\">electrify 90%</a> of urban mass public transport by 2030 under the country's National E-Mobility Plan. This would further reduce the need for imported oil.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25324539/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Cleaner power means better health.</h4><p>Fossil fuel power plants emit harmful pollutants, including fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. These contribute to air pollution-related illnesses, such as asthma, pneumonia, lung cancer and tuberculosis, often with fatal results. Air pollution accounted for close to <a href=\"https://www.stateofglobalair.org/resources/countryprofiles\">10% of all deaths</a> in Indonesia in 2021, claiming over 222,000 lives. This places it among the five countries (alongside China, India, Pakistan and Nigeria) that together account for 60% of air pollution-related deaths globally. The problem is so severe in Jakarta that, in 2021, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2024/04/18/jakartas-air-pollution-is-the-indonesian-governments-human-rights-failure/\">residents sued</a> then-President Joko Widodo and other top officials over harmful air quality — and won.</p><p>Air pollution also takes a financial toll. Each case of acute respiratory illness in Indonesia carries an economic cost of roughly <a href=\"https://iesr.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Fuel-Emission-Health-Impacts-Cost-of-Illness-and-Energy-Transition-Scenario-in-Indonesia-%E2%80%8BBudi-Haryanto_RCCC-UI.pdf\">IDR 570,000</a> (about US$34), according to the national health insurance system. Between 2016 and 2021, this cost the country more than IDR 341 billion (about US$21 million) in total. Meanwhile, lost workdays from illnesses reduce overall productivity.</p><p>Renewable energy deployment would significantly reduce dangerous air pollution, lowering healthcare costs and increasing workforce productivity. Our model shows that meeting Indonesia's clean energy goals could save an estimated 62,000 lives per year, compared with business as usual.</p><h3>Turning Projections into Reality</h3><p>Taken together, these wide-ranging benefits show that decisive climate action is not just about avoiding risks — it is about seizing opportunities to grow sustainably and improve people's lives. But urgency is paramount. Indonesia and other countries need to move swiftly to scale up clean energy and energy efficiency and avoid locking in costly, polluting fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come.</p><p>The first step is raising ambition. Our analysis, based on interventions outlined in the 2023 CIPP, shows that Indonesia needs 63.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030 and 200 gigawatts by 2040 to meet its GDP targets via clean power. By contrast, the government's Electricity Supply Business Plan aims for only 18.6 gigawatts by 2030 and 75 by 2040. To turn its growth and climate ambitions into reality, the government must more than double its clean energy targets.</p><p>Investing early in energy efficiency can immediately address short-term energy demand and emissions while the country works toward longer-term decarbonization. Near-term measures can include building new energy distribution infrastructure, like transmission lines or microgrids connecting Indonesia's main islands. It can also include updating existing systems; for example, by switching to more efficient LED-based lighting systems and retrofitting windows to reduce air conditioning demand.</p><p>The biggest thrust, however, must come from rapidly expanding renewable energy and slashing reliance on fossil fuels. This will require mobilizing unprecedented clean energy investment from both the public and private sectors on top of JETP financing. It will also take significant policy change, such as cutting fossil fuel subsidies; implementing cross-sector efficiency standards to reduce energy intensity in manufacturing, transport and buildings; and upgrading grid infrastructure to integrate variable renewable energy sources.</p><h3>Lighting the Way Ahead</h3><p>While our study focuses on Indonesia, the implications are global. Many developing and emerging economies are at a similar crossroads, working to expand energy access and grow rapidly without exacerbating climate risks — and to ensure that the transition leaves no one behind.</p><p>This research offers compelling evidence that a clean energy transition is not an obstacle to growth, but a catalyst for it. By aligning ambitious growth targets with decisive clean energy strategies, countries can take the first step toward unlocking sustainable prosperity.</p>",

      "description": "<p>It may seem like political divides around climate change are only deepening. Yet the <a href=\"https://peoplesclimate.vote/document/Peoples_Climate_Vote_Report_2024.pdf\">world's largest climate survey</a> reveals a striking consensus: Eighty percent of people globally want their countries to take stronger climate action, and over half think about climate change daily or weekly. Far from being split, humanity is largely united on wanting to do more.</p><p>But how can we help move the needle?</p><p>First things first: It's true that governments and big businesses hold the most power to halt climate change. They have the ability to reshape global systems — like how we generate energy, produce food and design cities — that are at the root of the crisis. This is why political actions, like voting and joining climate campaigns, are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-impact-behavior-shifts\">among the most impactful</a> you can take.</p><p>But there's a lot we can do in our daily lives, too. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/effective-impact-behavioral-shifts\"><strong>WRI research</strong></a><strong> shows that shifting a few key behaviors can significantly reduce emissions and climate impacts. And the more people who act, the bigger the collective change. </strong>The trick is knowing where to prioritize our efforts.</p><h3>Ranking Climate-Friendly Choices</h3><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>The Inequality of Emissions</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Wealthy populations have the highest emissions per capita and therefore the most opportunity to shift toward climate-friendly behaviors. By contrast, some developing countries may need to <em>increase</em> emissions to provide basic necessities, like reliable electricity and nutritious food, to all people. Governments should seek clean, affordable pathways to meet these needs, while the biggest cuts must come from the highest emitters.</p></div><p>Narratives around personal climate action can be misleading. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/6/pgaf191/8159053?login=false\">Research shows</a> that people often overestimate the climate benefits of easier behavioral changes, like recycling, while discounting more impactful ones, like cutting back on air travel and eating less meat.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/effective-impact-behavioral-shifts\">recent WRI paper</a> analyzed 19 climate-friendly behaviors to reveal which ones reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions the most. Even adopting just a few of these actions — particularly those with the biggest emissions-reduction potential — can make a difference. Understanding which actions pack the biggest punch also helps us know where to aim our collective action efforts for the maximum impact.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25378153/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The \"right\" decisions will look different for everyone depending on what's accessible to them. Living car-free is the most impactful behavior by far in terms of reducing emissions. But if that's unattainable, switching from a gas-powered car to an electric vehicle, or shifting as many trips as possible to walking, biking or public transit, also cuts emissions.</p><p>Similarly, going vegan is nearly 3 times more impactful for the climate than decreasing food waste, 9 times more impactful than decreasing consumption of packaged or processed goods, and 30 times more impactful than composting. Full veganism may be a stretch for most people, but going vegetarian or even reducing meat consumption also makes a difference.</p><p>Impact also depends on each person's starting point: Those who drive and fly extensively and eat meat-heavy diets have far greater emissions-reduction potential than those whose emissions are already minimal.</p><h3>The Catch: It Will Take All of Us</h3><p>Each of these actions can help reduce your own carbon emissions. But altering the trajectory of climate change hinges on not one, not a few, but billions of people making such shifts.</p><p>The challenge is that most high-impact behaviors — like living car-free or installing renewable energy at home — aren't equally accessible to everyone. Achieving truly widespread change will require unprecedented support from governments, companies, financial institutions and industry leaders to make these behavioral shifts easy, routine and accessible for most people.</p><p>Living car-free requires access to reliable public transit, safe bike infrastructure, and subsidies to help people to purchase bikes or e-bikes. Decreasing air travel often depends on companies offering remote options and governments investing in lower-carbon travel, like high-speed rail. Most people would need subsidies to afford the cost of installing rooftop solar panels or paying for energy-efficient home renovations.</p><p>Indeed, our <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/effective-impact-behavioral-shifts\">research</a> found that interventions intended to shift people toward climate-friendly behaviors — such as asking people to commit to using public transit, or comparing their energy use to their neighbors — achieve <em>only 10%</em> of their potential emissions impact without systemic support. The remaining 90% is reliant on broader changes that make individual actions attainable.</p><h3>So, What Should We Do to Make the Biggest Difference?</h3><p>This is the central challenge behind the numbers: Behavioral shifts aren't just personal, they are also shaped and enabled by the world around us. We need both individual and systems change to solve the problem.</p><p>If you want to make a difference, there are ways to contribute at both levels:</p><p>Push for what you can't control alone. Vote for leaders who support climate-smart investments; demand action from those already in power; sign petitions; and join collective campaigns that drive change at scale. For example, look for leaders who champion:</p><ul><li>Investing in public transit that is clean, reliable and accessible.</li><li>Subsidizing electric and hybrid vehicles and building a nationwide EV charging network.</li><li>Electrifying buildings and offering incentives for heat pumps, solar panels and energy-efficient retrofits.</li><li>Expanding protected bike lanes, bike share networks and walkable city planning.</li><li>Making plant-based food affordable, available and appealing.</li></ul><p>When it comes to daily choices, make the most impactful actions you can based on what's accessible and affordable for your circumstances. You might focus on what is most appealing in terms of health (to get more exercise, you could prioritize biking to work); financial savings (installing a heat pump can cut energy costs in the long term), or ease (if you do have to fly, prioritize economy class and/or direct flights).</p><p>With each vote, petition and personal change we make, we can become part of the global solution, signaling to leaders what the surveys already show: That we care about our collective climate future, and change cannot wait.</p>",

Because the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean School Bus Program limits eligibility to certain types of applicants, nonprofit school transportation providers like the Cherokee Boys Club could not apply directly. Instead, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians had to set up complex arrangements to channel grant funds, which added administrative difficulty to the process. In addition, in the early stages of the transition, the Cherokee Boys Club was surprised by the high infrastructure costs for necessary upgrades for EV charger installation. While they were able to work with their partner Duke Energy to cover these expenses, other school districts may need to budget for these upgrades. Districts may also be able to limit power demands by adopting practices such as <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/all-about-managed-charging-and-vehicle-everything-or-v2x\">managed charging</a>.</p><h3>Sipayik Elementary School (Maine Indian Education)</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.maineindianeducation.org/\">Maine Indian Education</a>, through <a href=\"https://www.maineindianeducation.org/article/1579420\">EPA's 2023 Clean School Bus Program rebate</a>, electrified the <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/how-rural-tribal-school-electrified-their-school-bus-fleet\">three buses serving Sipayik Elementary</a>, which educates Passamaquoddy Tribe’s youth who live on the <a href=\"https://wabanaki.com/\">Pleasant Point (Sipayik) Reservation</a> (sharing geography with Maine).</p><article class=\"align-right media media--type-embed media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25300703/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Sipayik Elementary’s transition was motivated by Maine Indian Education’s desire to address high respiratory disease rates among the Passamaquoddy community and reduce emissions and operational costs. The outcomes exceeded expectations with an 80% reduction in Maine Indian Education’s energy costs, 60% reduced maintenance expenses and approximately 25 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per bus avoided each year. The school district intends to reinvest its cost savings into school programs.</p><p>One of the project's most striking aspects lies in the integration of Passamaquoddy cultural values throughout the electrification effort. Instead of the vehicles’ safety feature playing default warning sounds to compensate for the buses’ silent operation, the buses play a traditional Passamaquoddy travel song recorded by tribal elder Wayne Newell during slow speeds. This fusion of language preservation with transportation modernization marks the beginning of Maine Indian Education’s broader vision to integrate cultural education with a curriculum that includes lessons on sustainability, science, math, language, and social sciences.</p><p class=\"secondary\"><em>Listen to a traditional Passamaquoddy travel song performed by tribal elder Wayne Newell:</em></p><p><audio controls=\"controls\" title=\"Recording of the Travel Elder Song played through the electric school bus speakers\">\n    <source src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/2025-10/travel-song.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n    </audio></p><h3>Shawnee Public Schools</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.countywidenews.com/news/sps-receives-142-million-epa-grant-electric-buses\">Shawnee Public Schools</a>, which serves students from the <a href=\"https://www.potawatomi.org/\">Citizen Potawatomi Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.choctawnation.com/about/\">Choctaw Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.muscogeenation.com/\">Muscogee (Creek) Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astribe.com/about-us\">Absentee Shawnee Tribe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sacandfoxnation-nsn.gov/about/\">Sac & Fox Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kickapootribeofoklahoma.com/\">Kickapoo Tribe</a>, <a href=\"https://iowanation.org/about-us/\">Iowa Nation (Baxoje)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sno-nsn.gov/\">Seminole Tribe</a>, pursued electrification for financial savings and air quality benefits.

Switching from diesel to electric was viewed as an essential step toward reducing pollution and protecting student health. The benefits soon extended beyond cleaner air. The buses helped spark community-wide interest in renewable energy and electric vehicles, aligning with Red Lake Nation’s broader goals of energy sovereignty and self-determination.</p><p>Getting the project underway was the most significant hurdle for the school. Navigating an unfamiliar industry, identifying manufacturers and building the right partnerships required persistence and teamwork. Those early challenges are now giving way to momentum, as the success of the pilot has encouraged other tribal schools and leaders to pursue electric buses of their own. For these communities, electric school buses are more than just a cleaner mode of transportation, they represent a pathway to healthier commutes, stronger communities and greater control over their energy future.</p><p>In addition to Endazhi-Nitaawiging's electric school bus deployment, Red Lake Schools, a public school operating within Red Lake Nation, has electrified their school bus fleet through a Clean School Bus Program award.</p><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><p>Tribal schools that have begun the transition from diesel to electric school buses emphasize that success depends on careful preparation, strong relationships and community engagement. Their experiences point to common strategies that can help other districts and those working alongside them to navigate the opportunities and challenges of electrification:</p><ul><li><strong>Start early</strong>. Allow ample time for community input, infrastructure assessments and grant applications.</li><li><strong>Build strong partnerships</strong>. Work closely with utility companies, vendors and community stakeholders, and prioritize collaboration with established manufacturers to ensure security and expertise throughout the deployment process.</li><li><strong>Plan thoroughly.</strong> Develop clear route deployment strategies, reliable maintenance services and comprehensive training programs for staff.</li><li><strong>Document and engage.</strong> Collect evidence of community support and assess health impacts to strengthen the case for electric buses and keep transitions people-centered.</li><li><strong>Honor culture and inspire youth</strong>.
