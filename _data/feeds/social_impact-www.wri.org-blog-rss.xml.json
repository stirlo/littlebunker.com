      "description": "<p><strong>Bogotá, D. C., Colombia (September 26, 2025)</strong> — Colombia has submitted its new national climate plan, or Nationally Determined Contribution 3.0 (NDC), committing to limit its emissions in 2035 to a maximum of between 155 and 161 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). Colombia has also reaffirmed its commitment to reduce black carbon emissions by 6,130 to 8,873 tons by 2035 compared to 2014 emissions, excluding forest fires.</p><p>The country’s new NDC also includes a climate adaptation component aimed at “reducing risk and the socio-economic impacts associated with climate variability and change.” Eight priorities have been defined for this component: biodiversity and ecosystem services; water resources; food security and agricultural production; human health; infrastructure; disaster risk management; cultural heritage; and human settlements.</p><p><em>Note: The Spanish version of this statement is </em><a href=\"https://es.wri.org/noticias/colombia-actualiza-sus-compromisos-climaticos-con-miras-al-2035\"><em>available here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Following is a statement by Carolina Useche, Director of Climate, Economics, and Finance at WRI Colombia:</strong></p><p>“This NDC update sends an encouraging signal of continuity in climate governance in our country. The declarative version, approved by the Intersectoral Commission on Climate Change, reaffirms Colombia’s international commitments not only to emissions reduction and the protection of strategic ecosystems such as the Amazon, but also to promoting socio-economic development that benefits people, nature and the climate.</p><p>“The update also highlights the inclusion of a loss and damage component, recognizing it as a reality and as a pillar of climate action. The goal is to foster greater financial support from the international community.</p><p>“In addition, as one of the first countries to endorse the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multi-Level Partnerships</a> (CHAMP) declaration, Colombia’s NDC acknowledges the role of <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-subnational-governments-are-shaping-colombias-next-generation-climate-commitments/\">subnational governments</a> in planning and implementing measures to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. The country will seek to promote governance that integrates national and subnational perspectives on climate action to meet its national climate goals.</p><p>“For over a decade, WRI has supported Colombia in defining and implementing its international commitments under the Paris Agreement, including the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/outcomes/important-countries-identify-opportunities-climate-action\">NDC</a> and Colombia’s Long-Term Climate Strategy (<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/outcomes/education-campaign-public-servants-students-advances-climate-action-colombia\">E2050</a>). Under this new NDC, WRI will continue providing technical assistance to the country to advance evidence-based climate action.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>Across the United States, energy rates continue to climb and contribute to energy inequities. Since 2021, the average residential electricity bill increased by $22 per month, adding up to an additional $264 per year, with more price hikes projected through 2030. The rise is largely <a href=\"https://powerlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PowerLines_Utility-Bills-Are-Rising_2025-1.pdf\">driven by inflation, aging grid infrastructure and</a> growing electricity demand from data centers.  A recent analysis by the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/with-americans-facing-utility-bill-increases-this-year-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-threatens-to-drive-costs-even-higher/\">Center for American Progress</a> found that nearly 60 utilities have either raised or are proposing to raise electric and gas rates by a combined $41.9 billion — impacts that could reach over 80 million customers.</p><p>Electricity rate hikes disproportionately impact low-income households. According to the <a href=\"https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/data_update_-_city_energy_burdens_0.pdf\">2024 Policy Brief on City Energy Burdens</a> by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE), one in four low-income households spends more than 15% of their income on energy, far exceeding the 6% threshold that indicates high burden. Black, Latino, Indigenous and immigrant households are disproportionately represented among these families, reflecting the legacy of discriminatory housing policies, inefficient housing stock and limited access to energy efficiency upgrades. The same ACEEE analysis found that nearly 77 million households, or one in every two households, have had to reduce or forego essentials like medicine or food at least once or twice to pay utility bills. </p><p>While low-income communities already face the greatest risk of climate-related impacts such as urban heat, extreme weather events and pollution, they are also being excluded from the decisions that offer potential solutions to the energy affordability crisis, such as clean energy.</p><p>Clean energy can help improve affordability by directly reducing households’ monthly utility bills and providing long-term price stability. While installing solar panels often requires high upfront costs that put it out of reach for historically disadvantaged or low-income households, once the system is installed, it provides families with a cheaper, more reliable and independent energy supply.</p><p>Subscriber-based community solar can also offer similar benefits but with even lower commitment that allows renters to participate. Low- to moderate-income (LMI) solar programs provide key financial support mechanisms, such as grants, rebates, on-bill financing, third-party ownership models and community solar options, that eliminate or reduce upfront payments. By covering or deferring these initial expenses, LMI solar programs provide a pathway for households to reap the long-term benefits of clean energy.</p><p>To avoid unintended obstacles to program uptake and address systemic barriers, successful LMI solar programs are designed together with the communities they aim to serve. Community-based organizations (CBOs) can be a key partner in this process, ensuring that program details such as financing options, outreach and program administration meet the needs of communities as well as thoroughly address the energy burden crisis and expand reliable, affordable and accessible clean energy.<strong>                       </strong></p><h3>The Case for CBO Leadership</h3><p>Locally formed and staffed by residents of nearby communities, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/justice40-community-based-organizations-environmental-justice\">CBOs</a> can take many forms; their missions typically center around religion, food, health care, education, housing, social services and/or community development. Given this local focus, CBOs have a deep understanding of local circumstances that allows them to act as trusted community liaisons: advocating for the community’s specific needs, educating residents on various issues, raising awareness about available resources and ensuring that community voices are heard through town halls, door-to-door outreach and focus groups.</p><p>Throughout May and June, WRI met with 10 environmental and equity-focused CBOs from across the United States to better understand their role in the community and their involvement in programmatic decisions for LMI-focused solar energy programs. From those conversations, we determined that many CBOs possess three key characteristics which make them uniquely qualified to not just champion or facilitate LMI solar programs, but also to inform and design them.</p><p>First, they are deeply trusted in the communities that they serve — their people and work are well-known among community members. Second, they are accessible; they routinely engage with the community in a capacity that makes them approachable and reliable. Lastly, they have a deep understanding of the local context, derived from their own belonging and familiarity with the community that they serve.</p><p>Based on these conversations, plus feedback from a WRI-hosted <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/events/2025/6/advancing-energy-equity-locally-led-solar-how-cbos-are-lighting-path-community-impact\">webinar on CBO-led clean energy programs</a>, and an analysis of LMI-focused solar program case studies, the team identified four persistent barriers that CBOs described as limiting solar adoption by LMI households:</p><ol><li>Homes need repairs first, such as roof repairs or replacements and electrical upgrades.</li><li>For residential rooftop solar, even with the few remaining available financial incentives, installation costs are still too high.</li><li>Program requirements or applications are complex and difficult for residents to navigate.</li><li>There is a disconnect with or distrust of solar developers due to <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/residential-rooftop-solar-complaints-tax-credits-fraud-deceptive-abusive-practices/651774/\">occasional predatory practices and deceptive actors</a>.</li></ol><h3>How CBOs Can Plug in Now</h3><p>How can CBOs solve these barriers by using their unique perspective to serve as a bridge between communities and solar programs? WRI identified seven strategies that CBOs can utilize to promote successful design and implementation of LMI-focused solar energy programs. These strategies range in both levels of effort required and approach, so CBOs of all sizes and capacities can help advance energy equity in their communities.</p><h4>1. Amplify success stories and testimonials to build trust.</h4><p>Solar implementation can have a “ripple effect” thanks to peer modeling. When one neighbor successfully installs solar panels, others are <a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/news/berkeley-lab-study-explores-how-low#:~:text=Low-income%20households%20are%20more,neighbors%20to%20install%20solar%20too\">more likely to follow</a>. CBOs can amplify local success stories and highlight the benefits of solar, building trust and increasing community interest in the technology. </p><h4>2. Raise community awareness of existing solar programs.</h4><p>CBOs are often more trusted messengers than government staff when it comes to community programming. They can provide resources and materials on existing solar programs and ensure that all communities have access to the cost-saving benefits of renewable energy.</p><h4>3. Help co-design programs by tailoring solutions to overcome local barriers.</h4><p>CBOs can engage with grant recipients and <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/SFA-for-CBOs.pdf\">city sustainability teams</a> to make sure that programs center community priorities and are accessible, attractive and relevant for the communities that they support.</p><h4>4. Identify workforce development programs and connect with community members.</h4><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Regional-Summaries-US-Community-Based-Organizations-and-Their-Relationship-to-Solar-Energy-Development.pdf\">strong local workforce</a> helps successfully scale rooftop and community solar projects. CBOs can do more than support the design and facilitation of training programs; more importantly, they can also leverage established relationships to <a href=\"https://www.jff.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/What_Can_CBOs_Teach_Us_About_Achieving_Equity_in_Workforce_Development_122023.pdf\">ensure residents can access career pathways</a> as the clean energy economy evolves.</p><h4>5. Help residents navigate and enroll in various energy assistance programs.</h4><p>Low-income solar programs can require extensive paperwork to apply — including income verification and access to past electricity bills — that serve as a barrier to participation. CBOs can help <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Implementing-Washington-DCs-Solar-for-All-Program.pdf\">streamline this process</a> by providing checklists on what is needed to sign up, as well as by holding in-person Q&A events that work to demystify the application process.</p><h4>6. Join community task forces, working groups and/or advisory committees to discuss barriers and solutions to low-income solar.</h4><p>Because CBOs are often a trusted entity with whom community members can voice concerns and develop solutions, they often have a unique and holistic understanding of the barriers to low-income solar adoption. They can use this knowledge to develop solutions in key community forums, such as task forces, working groups and/or advisory committees.</p><h4>7. Vet solar installers and developers to streamline collaboration and build trust with program participants.</h4><p>Many low-income households may hesitate to adopt solar due to unfamiliarity with and distrust of installers and developers. CBOs can play a critical role in protecting residents from deceptive practices in a variety of ways. By vetting solar vendors and contractors, fostering direct engagement and guiding investors on equitable engagement strategies, CBOs can foster trust between installers and developers and community members. Partnering with government-led group procurement can also help provide assurance to program participants that the contractors are trusted.</p><p>These strategies aim to expand opportunities for CBO involvement in energy equity and LMI solar initiatives. However, many CBOs are already active in solar program design and implementation; across the country, numerous organizations have successfully advanced rooftop solar adoption among LMI households.</p><h3>Replicable Pathways: Templates for Community-Driven Solar Success</h3><h4>Georgia Interfaith Power & Light (GIPL)</h4><p>GIPL supports faith communities in adopting solar energy through its <a href=\"https://gipl.org/solar#:~:text=GIPL%20helps%20faith%20communities%20and%20religious%20schools%20explore,commitment%20to%20being%20better%20stewards%20of%20Sacred%20Earth\">Congregational Solar Program (CSP)</a>, which has been active since 2018. GIPL assists houses of worship by serving as a liaison between congregations, vetted installers and utilities to streamline effective projects. The CSP facilitates solar feasibility studies, reviews proposals with congregations and supports decision-making around financing options — including if and how to utilize power purchase agreements, grants, tax incentives such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-pay-clean-energy-tax-credits-us-benefits\">direct pay</a> (authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act) and GIPL’s own solar loan fund.</p><p>Through education, storytelling and media outreach, GIPL raises awareness and inspires other congregations to follow suit. It provides materials such as one-pagers, social media graphics and case studies to build trust and demonstrate the real impact of solar savings. Their approach aims to create a ripple effect: enabling faith communities to become solar adopters, reinvesting some of that savings into local needs and inspiring broader community transformation.</p><p>So far, GIPL has installed 620 kilowatts across 25 projects, offsetting 3,541 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. GIPL is proving that CBOs are not peripheral to clean energy implementation but rather are essential to building a just solar future.</p><p>When asked what advice GIPL would give to other CBOs looking to engage with program administrators and local governments around clean energy, Hannah Shultz, GIPL’s program director, emphasized the need for resource planning and partnership development, specifically establishing relationships with the program administrator, as GIPL did with Georgia BRIGHT, and connecting with pro-bono organizations, such as Lawyers for Good Government. This external support and technical resources were key in establishing and expanding GIPL’s solar assistance program. Many other participants in the June 2025 webinar agreed, with 70% of respondents asserting they needed more one-on-one coaching, formal guidance and toolkits to implement the proposed strategies.</p><h4>Washington, D.C.’s Solar for All Program<strong> </strong></h4><p>In administering <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Implementing-Washington-DCs-Solar-for-All-Program.pdf\">Washington, D.C.’s Solar for All program</a> since 2016, the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment collaborated closely with CBOs to ensure program success. The locally run program was enabled and funded through the Renewable Portfolio Standard of 2016 and served as a model for the 2022 national program. At the program’s outset, CBOs assisted in generating support and community buy-in for the program, as communities were justifiably hesitant to subscribe to a program that seemed too good to be true. Key supporting activities included writing letters of support for the Solar for All program, which were used to recruit new subscribers, and meeting with community members to share program details through trusted messengers. Throughout the program, CBOs served as crucial connectors between the program administrator and communities to ensure fair treatment of subscribers and achievement of program goals.</p><h4>Michigan's Solar for All Program</h4><p>Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy was one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Solar for All grant awardees which included CBOs as integral in producing an inclusive program that reflected community priorities in its design and implementation. The <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/climate-and-energy/mi-healthy-climate-plan/funding/ggrf/mi-solar\">MI Solar for All program</a> also highlighted the various roles that CBOs played in implementing LMI solar programs. For community solar projects, CBOs may be site hosts and design projects to benefit their communities, such as resilience hubs. Alternatively, CBOs could assist in identifying site hosts for community solar projects. For residential rooftop solar projects, CBOs can play a critical role in engaging community members, raising awareness of the program and advising on program application.</p><p>The MI Solar for All program envisioned its partner CBOs as a key instrument for educating community members about energy efficiency, enabling upgrades, solar and energy storage, as well as how such technologies are helpful in lowering household electricity bills. To build this out, it organized a focus group of CBOs to understand the communities they intend to serve, tailor engagement strategies, address barriers to previous program participation and discuss how best to on-board CBOs as formal, compensated partners.</p><p>Although the MI Solar for All program, which provided free low-cost solar for LMI residents in all 50 states, was formally canceled by the EPA in August 2025, ongoing legal challenges mean its future remains uncertain. City and state leaders, however, can take lessons from the program’s approach.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Solar deployment is a critical part of the solution to rising energy costs, and the path to equitable and affordable clean energy begins at the community level. CBOs bring lived experience, cultural understanding and respect, and deep local trust that cannot be replicated by outside actors. When included as true partners, CBOs can transform solar programs from technical interventions into community-driven solutions that meet families and households' energy needs. Without their leadership, many programs risk reinforcing existing energy inequities instead of dismantling them.</p><p>Policymakers, utilities and program administrators must commit resources, decision-making power and long-term partnerships to ensure CBOs are not only consulted but positioned as co-leaders in clean energy deployment. Funders and advocates can accelerate progress by investing in CBO capacity, offering technical support, and amplifying their success stories to catalyze replication nationwide. Most importantly, communities must be empowered to shape the clean energy future on their own terms.</p><p>To thoroughly address energy insecurity and ensure that the benefits of solar reach those who need them most, we must center equity, trust and community leadership at every stage. The question is not whether community leaders should lead, but how we can remove barriers to their participation and provide clearer entry points into program design, ultimately ensuring all communities will experience the benefits from the clean energy transition.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>NEW YORK (September 24, 2025)</strong> — At the UN Secretary-General’s Special High-Level Event on Climate Action, Premier Li Qiang announced that China will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% by 2035 as part of its national climate commitment under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>China also made several sectoral commitments, including to: increase the share of its non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30%, expand the installed capacity of wind and solar to over 6 times 2020 levels, striving to bring the total to 3,600 gigawatts, increase forest stocks to 24 billion cubic meters, and make electric vehicles the mainstream of new sales.</p><p>The following are statements from WRI’s Global Climate, Economics and Finance Program and WRI China.</p><p><strong>Melanie Robinson, Global Climate, Economics and Finance Director at World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“China has committed to a 7-10% emissions reductions target from peak levels, striving for more. This includes an absolute target and all greenhouse gases for the first time.</p><p>“Depending on assumptions, delivering the top end of this target by 2035, would require a decline at least 3 times faster from 2035 to reach China’s 2060 net zero target. </p><p>“However, if China’s pace of deployment of renewables and EVs, and rate of emissions decrease (which was <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-record-solar-growth-keeps-chinas-co2-falling-in-first-half-of-2025/\">1% in the first half of 2025</a>, year over year), continues, China would overdeliver on its 2035 target. China has overdelivered in some areas in the past, notably on renewables. Renewables, batteries and EVs are together contributing to <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-clean-energy-contributed-a-record-10-of-chinas-gdp-in-2024/#:~:text=Clean,9tn\">a quarter of China’s economic growth</a>. </p><p>“China has the scale, technological ability and economic momentum to play a major role in the transition.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Fang Li, Country Director of World Resources Institute China: </strong></p><p>“China's latest NDC marks a new step in its low-carbon transition and provides a key signal to the world as COP30 approaches.</p><p>“It is notable that China’s topline target addresses methane and other high-impact greenhouse gases. Reducing these emissions will benefit both the climate and human health, as they also act as ambient pollutants.</p><p>“China is working to address the practical challenges of the low-carbon economic transition in ways that are good for growth, jobs and equity. Already China’s economy is seeing the positive impacts of its investments in clean energy. Looking ahead, COP30 will provide both China and the international community with a crucial opportunity to advance the transition toward a cleaner, more prosperous world.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>The world <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">is losing</a> 18 soccer fields of tropical primary every minute; much of it is the result of clearing for farms, pastures and tree plantations.</p><p>As a major buyer of commodities largely responsible for fueling deforestation — such as palm oil, cocoa, coffee, soy, cattle and timber — the EU has both a responsibility and an opportunity to help shift global markets toward more sustainable supply chains. The landmark <strong>EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)</strong>, adopted in 2023, requires businesses to demonstrate that the products they sell or export to the EU do not come from land that was recently deforested or degraded. </p><p>The EUDR is a key step in responding to today’s deforestation and supporting countries in achieving their national forest protection policies. <strong>Yet despite its promise, the regulation faces delays and pushback, threatening its timely implementation.</strong></p><p>In September 2025, the EU Commission <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-time-to-enforce-not-delay-eu-deforestation-regulation\">proposed delaying</a> the EUDR's enforcement until December 2026, pushing back its start date for the second year in a row. In July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/07/07/nineteen-eu-countries-call-for-simplification-of-eu-deforestation-law\" target=\"_blank\">EU Agriculture Ministers issued a letter calling for the EUDR's simplification</a>, while a symbolic vote in the European Parliament objected to the regulation's critical benchmarking system. </p><p>At a time when forests are increasingly under threat, it’s more urgent than ever to understand the regulation and ensure its full and rapid implementation. Here, we dive deeply into the legislation's details and potential impacts.</p><h3>What Is the EUDR?</h3><p>The EUDR is a landmark law that came into force in June 2023. Its goal is to ensure that certain products sold in or exported to the EU do not come from land that was deforested or degraded after Dec. 31, 2020. The regulation is designed to prevent EU consumer demand from driving further forest loss or damage, while also reducing the region’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity decline.</p><p>The EUDR covers timber and six key agricultural commodities: cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soy, as well as products made from them such as beef, furniture and chocolate. To be sold in or exported from the EU market, these products must meet the following <strong>three conditions</strong>:</p><ol><li>They are <strong>deforestation-free</strong>.</li><li>They have been <strong>produced in compliance with the relevant laws of the country of origin</strong>.</li><li>They are <strong>covered by a due diligence statement</strong>, showing that the company has checked the origin and ensured the products meet EUDR requirements.</li></ol><p>This means businesses must demonstrate that any EUDR-covered commodities were not produced on land <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data/satellite-data-eu-regulation-deforestation-free-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">that was deforested</a> nor did they <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/monitoring-forest-degradation-eudr/\" target=\"_blank\">contribute to forest degradation</a> after the Dec. 31, 2020 cutoff date. Although the regulation is legally in place, companies are not yet required to comply yet. The rules will apply starting from Dec. 30, 2025, for large enterprises and June 30, 2026, for small and medium-sized businesses.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1026\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"821\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"629\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"495\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A graphic that shows the key EUDR development milestones from 2003 to 2026\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/25-7-7-eudr-timeline-v3_0.png?VersionId=yjL36gY4ley7L3GRiiF4CpKNCc0xcqdN&itok=XmopERpJ\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p> </p><h3>Why Is the EUDR important?</h3><p>The EUDR offers a major opportunity for the EU to reduce its role in global deforestation and biodiversity loss, as well as help create deforestation-free supply chains.

In fact, out of 160 agricultural commodities imported by the EU, just six — beef, palm oil, soy, cocoa, coffee and rubber, as covered by the EUDR — made up 58% of the estimated forest loss tied to EU imports.</p><p>By reducing the EU’s forest-loss footprint and tackling deforestation risks in its supply chains, the EUDR could help reverse deforestation worldwide. In 2024, a record 6.7 million hectares of <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\" target=\"_blank\">primary tropical forests</a> were lost — nearly double the 2023 rate and equivalent of losing 18 soccer fields of forest every minute. While wildfires captured global attention, some of the increase was due to agricultural conversion and logging.</p><h3>What Challenges and Setbacks Has the EUDR Faced?</h3><p>In December 2024, <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/3234/oj/eng\" target=\"_blank\">the EU postponed the start of EUDR </a>compliance by 12 months to give companies more time to prepare to meet the regulation’s requirements. Then in September 2025, the EU Commission again signaled its intention to delay implementation by another year, reportedly because of issues with the EU platform used to submit due diligence statements. Once the commission makes its proposal for a delay, both the European Council and European Parliament will have to agree to these terms. Some fear proposals to water down the regulation will be reintroduced during this amendment process. </p><p>In May 2025, the European Commission published the regulation’s <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-implementing-regulation-laying-down-rules-application-deforestation-regulation_en\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarking classification</a> system, which ranks countries as low, standard and high risk based on indicators assessing the deforestation risk linked to commodity production in each country. The ranking system was designed to help businesses and enforcement authorities in the EU to conduct due diligence and enforce compliance. The risk levels indicate the percentage of checks on shipments, with greater scrutiny given to higher-risk countries. </p><p>New proposals call on the EU Commission to revise the benchmarking classification system introduced in 2025. Some EU member state representatives have suggested adding a “no-risk” category to exempt certain countries from due diligence requirements; another suggestion proposed removing the system altogether. But <a href=\"https://www.fern.org/publications-insight/wto-implications-of-the-proposed-no-risk-amendment-to-the-eudr/\" target=\"_blank\">changes like these</a> could <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\">create loopholes and ultimately weaken</a> the regulation’s effectiveness. The European Parliament already <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\">rejected a similar idea in 2024</a> for that very reason.</p><p>The EUDR was agreed upon following a lengthy negotiation between EU institutions and member states, as well as impact assessments and extensive consultations. Derailing its implementation would penalize producer countries and companies that have already invested in compliance, and it would create confusion and uncertainty in the EU market. The regulation may not be perfect, but it’s a necessary step toward deforestation-free supply chains. <a href=\"https://www.cofcointernational.com/newsroom/first-cofco-soymeal-shipment-aligned-with-upcoming-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr-requirements-loads-in-argentina/\" target=\"_blank\">Many companies</a> have already shown that <a href=\"https://www.adm.com/en-us/news/news-releases/2024/7/as-eu-deforestation-regulation-approaches-adm-offers-fully-verified-segregated-traceable-soybean-meal-and-oil-to-european-customers/\" target=\"_blank\">EUDR</a> <a href=\"https://www.danzer.com/en/company/media-relations/danzer-blog/item/we-are-ready-for-the-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr\" target=\"_blank\">compliance</a> is possible, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neumann-kaffee-gruppe_neumannkaffeegruppe-nkg-greencoffee-activity-7341043266814902282-ZxzX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAE1-pABvCIe5Hj5bAjDVEQyxMlfXsVXU2U\" target=\"_blank\">several</a> have urged the EU to uphold the legal text and stick to <a href=\"https://www.tchibo.com/de/de/news/tchibo-fordert-umsetzung-eudr\" target=\"_blank\">implementation timeline</a>.</p><p>Since adoption, the EUDR has faced criticism from both inside and outside the EU. Most concerns focus on cost and complexity of compliance, as well as fairness, particularly for smallholder farmers. In response, the European Commission, EU member states and other development institutions have ramped up investment in <a href=\"https://green-forum.ec.europa.eu/nature-and-biodiversity/deforestation-regulation-implementation_en\" target=\"_blank\">EUDR preparedness</a> by issuing resources and guidance, with a particular emphasis on <a href=\"https://zerodeforestationhub.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">preventing smallholder exclusion from the EU market</a>.</p><h3>What Counts as Deforestation and Degradation Under the EUDR?</h3><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\">The regulation's <strong>definition of a forest </strong>largely follows the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which defines it as land larger than 0.5 hectares with trees taller than 5 meters and a canopy cover of at least 10% that is not primarily used for farming or urban development.</p></div><p>Under the EUDR, <strong>deforestation</strong> refers to clearing forest to make way for agriculture. The key factor is the conversion of land that was forest in 2020 into farmland — such as pastures or soy plantations. It’s a complete land-use change: the forest is no longer a forest.</p><ul><li>If that forest is cleared — whether by people or natural events like fire — and then converted into farmland, such as pastures for raising cattle or fields for soy or palm oil, it is considered deforestation.</li><li>However, if a forest is cleared, for example by fire (whether from human activity or natural causes) and is <strong>not</strong> used to produce any of the six EUDR-covered agricultural commodities, it is <strong>not </strong>considered deforestation under the regulations.</li><li>Forests used for wood production are not considered deforestation unless they’re also used for agriculture, for example, cattle grazing under the tree canopy.</li></ul><p>The EUDR also covers <strong>degradation</strong>. Land that was forest in 2020 can be used for wood production and remain classified as a forest, even if it’s temporarily unstocked, according to EUDR definitions. A forest used for wood production is not considered degraded unless there's a specific structural change, such as:</p><ul><li>Converting primary forest (native, untouched forest) into other wooded land (trees have 5%-10% canopy cover) or into plantation or planted forest.</li><li>Converting naturally regenerating forest (which has largely grown back on its own) into other wooded land used or plantation forest.</li></ul><h3>Who Does the EUDR Affect?</h3><p>The EUDR affects any company that imports, produces or exports specific products, and their derivatives, to or from the EU market. This includes <strong>operators</strong> (those placing products on the market or exporting them from the market) and <strong>traders</strong> (those distributing and selling products).</p><p>It applies to companies based in the EU and internationally, and to businesses of all sizes, from micro and small enterprises to large corporations. However, larger businesses face stricter reporting requirements than smaller ones.</p><p>The EUDR spans multiple sectors, from food and beverage (such as companies sourcing cocoa and coffee) to fashion (leather goods, for example) to the healthcare industry (products such as latex gloves).</p><h3>How Are Countries and Companies Preparing for the EUDR?</h3><p>Under the EUDR, companies must prove that products linked to deforestation or degradation after Dec. 31, 2020, are not entering the EU market. This requires a due diligence process: collecting supply chain information (including geolocation), assessing the risk of deforestation and taking steps to eliminate any identified risk before the product can be put on the market.</p><h4>Country-level efforts</h4><p>Many producer countries are already taking concrete steps to prepare for the EUDR, from adopting national plans to developing traceability systems and improving data transparency. For example, Indonesia, Ghana and Vietnam are investing in government-led efforts to make information available to companies that must comply with the regulation. Delaying enforcement or altering the regulation’s scope could undermine these leading producer countries.</p><p>Vietnam stands out as a strong example of how the EUDR is reinforcing national policies to combat deforestation. As a top exporter of rubber and coffee, the country has shifted its focus from illegal logging to broader deforestation risks in agriculture since the regulation’s introduction.  In 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development adopted a <a href=\"https://www.4c-services.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/02.-Nguyen-Nhu-Cuong_Action-Plan-for-the-compliance-with-EUDR-of-Viet-Nam.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">national action plan</a> prioritizing sustainable agricultural transformation. The following year, it launched a traceability system for coffee farms, piloting geospatial verification (such as satellite images) in key producing provinces. Developed through <a href=\"https://idh.org/news/vietnams-coffee-sector-marks-a-landmark-step-towards-sustainability-launching-the-eudr-database-system-for-forest-and-coffee-growing-areas\" target=\"_blank\">public-private collaboration</a>, the system cross-references land-use maps and cadastral data to ensure EUDR compliance. Plans are also underway to expand it to rubber and cocoa.</p><p>Vietnam’s progress shows how the regulation can act as a catalyst for stronger policy alignment between global market demands and local sustainability goals. </p><p>EU member states are also preparing by using satellite and aerial earth observation data, such as forest maps from 2020 (the EUDR cutoff year) to detect deforestation, alongside other monitoring solutions and tools to support compliant imports. </p><h4>Private-sector efforts</h4><p>Companies across supply chains are ramping up EUDR preparations, sparking a wave of innovation in monitoring and traceability. Many are developing satellite-based systems to verify deforestation-free sourcing, training smallholder farmers to meet EUDR requirements and partnering with governments and NGOs to improve data sharing and risk assessment.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.meridia.land/case/unilevers-smallholder-hub-programme\" target=\"_blank\">Unilever and Meridia</a> are working together to map smallholder farmers in Indonesia, making it possible to trace palm oil from plantation to mill. <a href=\"https://sustainablenaturalrubber.org/annual-report-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">The Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR)</a> has created a system to help companies follow sustainability practices and demonstrate EUDR compliance. Open-source platforms like WRI’s Global Forest Watch are also <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/satellite-data-eu-regulation-deforestation-free-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">supporting companies in verifying supply chains</a>.</p><p>These efforts from governments, companies and EU countries show how the EUDR is already driving unprecedented action — transforming compliance from a burden into an opportunity to build more responsible and transparent supply chains. The challenge now is scaling these solutions across all commodities and regions.</p><h3>What's Next for the EUDR?</h3><p>The EUDR represents a major milestone in the fight against commodity-driven deforestation.</p><p>The EU must reject attempts to weaken the regulation’s core requirements. Its effectiveness depends on maintaining its ambition without dilution or delay. Backtracking at this stage would undermine the EUDR’s credibility and send the wrong signal to global markets. </p><p>At the same time, the EU should also step up efforts to provide clear guidance to businesses, along with practical training and support to help them develop the skills needed for compliance, especially for small businesses that may otherwise struggle to meet requirements.</p><p id=\"footnotes\">The European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States should stay the course and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-changes-threaten-effectiveness-eu-deforestation-regulation\" target=\"_blank\">deliver the EUDR as planned</a>. It is not only a necessary response to the crisis of forest loss, but also a vital tool to support and complement producer country efforts to halt deforestation by 2030.</p><p id=\"footnotes\"><em>Editor's Note: This piece was originally published on July 8, 2025.

      "description": "<p><strong>NEW YORK (September 24, 2025)</strong> — The UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit closed today with several new climate commitments from countries setting emissions targets through 2035 — a critical waypoint on the path to net zero by mid-century. The Summit is an important milestone as the UN prepares its NDC Synthesis Report next month, which will assess the collective impact of new pledges before this year’s COP30.</p><p>This statement reflects both country announcements and official NDC submissions made so far, drawing on preliminary <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/\">Climate Watch</a> data to show their potential emissions reductions in gigatons compared to countries’ 2030 targets. </p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO, World Resources Institute: </strong></p><p>“We cannot sugarcoat it: these new climate plans do not put us anywhere near on track for a safe future. The lack of ambition from most major emitters so far, barring a few, underscores the immense political challenge countries face of transforming their entire economy. Yet vulnerable countries continue to step up with bold climate leadership.</p><p>“Countries’ last round of NDCs put the world on track for up to 2.8°C of warming, already exposing billions of people to more frequent and intense heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods. By 2035, the world needs to cut 31.2 gigatons of emissions to stay on track for 1.5°C, or 20.2 Gt for 2°C. The NDCs and announcements so far would reduce that by just 2 gigatons  — only 6% of what’s needed for 1.5°C and 10% for 2°C. </p><p>“By COP30, it is critical that all countries deliver the most ambitious possible climate plans, especially the major emitters still missing from the table.</p><p>“Some countries are taking steps to transform key sectors of their economy. Falling costs are accelerating this momentum: clean energy, heat pumps, and electric vehicles are now the lowest cost option in many parts of the world — creating jobs, boosting countries’ growth and competitiveness, securing reliable clean energy, and improving people’s quality of life. Countries need to do much more to seize this momentum and scale up renewable energy and clean transport solutions.</p><p>“The stakes could not be higher. Climate-related disasters cost the world at least $300 billion in 2024 alone, and without stronger steps these losses will continue to escalate. By COP30, all countries must present a clear response and double down on solutions within our grasp to cut emissions and build adequate resilience.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>The built environment accounts for over <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/20.500.11822/47214\">one-third of global emissions</a>. In rapidly developing markets like India and Mexico, a surge in housing construction faces a pivotal choice: lock in high-carbon infrastructure or, with the right interventions, enable resilient, low-carbon designs and create <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\">millions of green jobs.</a></p><p>When supported by integrated policies, targeted finance and adaptive business models, these markets have the potential to leapfrog to <a href=\"https://worldgbc.org/climate-action/what-is-a-net-zero-carbon-building/\">net-zero carbon and resilient buildings</a> (NZCRBs), reducing emissions, strengthening climate resilience and delivering important socio-economic benefits — from lower energy bills to healthier living conditions.</p><p>Yet, progress remains slow: NZCRBs make up <a href=\"https://www.buildings.com/resiliency-sustainability/energy-water-efficiency/article/33018289/net-zero-building-market-forecasted-to-experience-significant-growth\">less than 1% of global building stock</a>, with residential buildings comprising an even smaller percentage. While demand for efficient housing is growing rapidly, fragmented policies, limited financing and pilots that fail to scale still limit progress. By focusing on residential housing where these challenges converge and urgency is greatest, this article aims to unpack the most persistent barriers.</p><p>To unlock large-scale solutions and investment, it is essential to first clarify a shared definition of NZCRBs and then carefully map the systemic barriers to overcome.</p><h3>What Are Net-Zero Carbon and Resilient Buildings?</h3><p>NZCRBs minimize energy demand, employ renewable energy and are built or retrofitted using low-carbon or recycled materials. They are designed to withstand climate shocks, such as heat waves, flooding and storms, while reducing emissions through the entire life cycle of the building from material sourcing to operation to end-of-life.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24874212/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>There are many types of NZCRBs, including those designed for residential, commercial and institutional uses. Unlike traditional sustainability-certifiable buildings, which primarily focus on reducing energy use and environmental impact, or resilience-oriented buildings, which emphasize physical durability and disaster risk reduction, NZCRBs deliberately integrate both priorities. They simultaneously address decarbonization and climate adaptation, aligning the built environment with net-zero carbon pathways and safeguarding communities against intensifying climate hazards. This holistic approach ensures that homes are not only energy-efficient and low-emission but future-proofed and capable of maintaining safety and livability during extreme events.</p><p>The relative balance between the “net zero” and “resilience” dimensions of NZCRBs can differ across geographies. In medium-income, temperate regions with stronger energy policies, like in Mexico and Latin America, the emphasis often leans toward decarbonization, maximizing efficiency, renewable integration and carbon-neutral materials. In contrast, in climate-vulnerable and rapidly urbanizing regions such as India and Southeast Asia, resilience features may be prioritized, which could include passive cooling, flood-proofing and structural durability, with net-zero measures introduced incrementally. This geographic differentiation underscores the importance of context-specific pathways: All NZCRBs share common principles, but their design and implementation must reflect local climate priorities, regulatory frameworks and socioeconomic realities.</p><p>While NZCRB design principles can apply broadly, our focus is scaling both net-zero and resilient residential dwellings, given their outsized impact and opportunity. These homes offer clear benefits: lower energy costs, healthier indoor environments and reduced vulnerability to climate risks. However, key barriers persist, such as limited affordability, lack of tailored finance, weak policy enforcement, entrenched unsustainable practices and limited technical capacity — especially in emerging markets.</p><h3>What’s Holding NZCRBs Back? And How Can Sustainable Buildings Be Scaled?</h3><p>Smaller developers and building owners often face high upfront costs when shifting to NZCRBs. Energy-efficiency upgrades frequently place the financial burden on owners, while tenants capture most of the benefits. This split-incentive challenge is common in rental housing markets and hampers upgrades. In India, for instance, landlords of low-income rental units are often reluctant to invest in passive cooling or energy-efficient retrofits because tenants capture the utility savings but lack the security of tenure to justify contributing to upfront costs. Similar dynamics <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01956574241281107\">have been documented</a> in Mexico’s rental housing sector, where building owners hesitate to finance rooftop solar or insulation improvements without mechanisms to share benefits and costs with tenants.</p><p>Risk‐sharing models, such as joint investments among owners, cooperative financing and owner–tenant agreements help distribute costs more fairly. In Europe, <a href=\"https://www.jll.com/en-uk/newsroom/revamping-green-leases-is-critical-to-driving-decarbonization\">green lease</a> arrangements are emerging to align incentives, explicitly linking rent structures to energy performance so both landlords and tenants gain from efficiency upgrades. These innovations tackle resistance and unlock investment, boosting investor confidence, fostering transparency and reducing the initial costs of action.</p><p>For residential buildings, pairing inclusive finance and supportive policy frameworks specifically addresses affordability and equitable access. However, policy gaps and weak enforcement continue to slow progress. Both local and national governments play critical roles as market catalysts.  Well‐designed and consistently enforced building decarbonization and resilience policies — integrated across housing, energy, utilities and planning —are needed to directly target regulatory fragmentation and unsustainable practices. For example, the Eco Niwas Samhita, India's Energy Conservation Building Code for residential buildings, sets mandatory efficiency standards for building envelopes, shading and ventilation, helping reduce heat and energy use in low- and middle-income housing.</p><p>In Mexico City, while detailed NZCRB‐type standards are less widespread (especially for low-income housing), the city’s complementary technical standards have been incorporating energy-efficiency and sustainability requirements into the building permit regime, especially for larger residential and mixed-use buildings. These are being updated to cover more resilience dimensions as well.</p><p>Stakeholder collaboration is often missing in practice, leading to fragmented standards, duplicated efforts and limited uptake of sustainable building solutions. In cities, global developers experiment with pilot NZCRB projects, but without platforms to share data or lessons, results remain siloed, stifling replication and market confidence. Stakeholder collaboration is therefore essential. Cross-sector knowledge hubs that share best practices and facilitate data exchange are crucial for setting standards and supporting government benchmarking for greater transparency and accountability. These platforms turn lessons learned into practice, provide businesses with supply chain and market intelligence, and address technical gaps and market barriers by creating the conditions for NZCRBs to move from pilots to market standards.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24861679/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>The Four Levers to Scale NZCRBs</h3><p>Against this landscape of challenges, WRI's <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/all-net-zero-built-environment\">All in for a Net Zero Built Environment</a> initiative has identified four critical levers for driving transformative change: coordinated action, supportive policies, tailored finance and business model innovation.</p><p>Each of the levers is mapped to different barriers. By directly targeting specific challenges like affordability, weak policy signals and lack of technical or financial innovation, these strategies provide a coherent pathway to scaling. While the four interconnected levers are essential for scaling NZCRBs in India and Mexico, the levers can also be applied globally.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24874256/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>1) Commitment and Collaboration</h4><p>Scaling NZCRBs requires coordinated action across national and local governments, developers, financial institutions, utilities and community groups. City action plans and national roadmaps have proven critical in Europe, and more recently also in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/mexico-india-advance-net-zero-climate-resilient-buildings\">Mexico and India</a>, to help bridge policy gaps by identifying retrofit targets and integrating housing, energy and planning policies. These strategies ensure coherence between local ambitions and national climate goals. Knowledge hubs and multi-stakeholder task forces that bring together architects, builders, investors, utilities, regulators and civil society can harmonize standards, track implementation and share best practices across markets. Embedding social inclusion within these structures ensures that vulnerable and marginalized groups are represented in decision-making, leading to equitable and effective outcomes. Without this vertical, horizontal and inclusive coordination, policies risk missing cross-cutting issues, such as aligning building codes with electricity access or linking housing subsidies to low-carbon design.</p><h4>2) Supportive Policies</h4><p>Mandatory energy codes for life-cycle emissions and climate-resilience standards accelerate mitigation, while incentives like tax breaks and fast-track permitting reduce compliance costs for builders and investors. Robust codes paired with life-cycle assessments ensure that emissions are addressed from construction through operation and end-of-life, preventing carbon lock-in and enabling a true accounting of environmental impacts. These tools provide a foundation for scaling NZCRBs that remains sustainable over decades. Effective programs often sequence voluntary initiatives to pilot new approaches, gradually transitioning to mandatory codes as supply chains and markets mature. This approach enables innovation at early stages, while safeguards, such as subsidies and social housing, ensure that standards do not exclude low-income communities, due to affordability constraints, as they take effect.</p><h4>3) Financial Instruments and Mechanisms</h4><p>Finance is a significant and complex barrier to NZCRB adoption. Residential buildings require substantial upfront and long-term capital, which smaller developers or households often cannot access. Effective solutions include:</p><ul><li><strong>Sovereign green bonds</strong> fund climate-friendly buildings, but typically only large developers can access them.</li><li><strong>Blended finance </strong>of philanthropic and public funds can reduce risk to enable the participation of smaller firms and affordable housing projects.</li><li><strong>Performance-based investments</strong> channel financing toward projects that achieve energy savings and align capital deployment with measurable results.</li><li><strong>On-bill and</strong> <strong>property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing</strong> tie repayments to utility bills or property taxes to reduce upfront cost of construction or retrofit.</li></ul><div class=\"callout city-callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link city-callout-heading\"><strong>Case Study</strong></p><p><em><strong>Mexico’s Hipoteca Verde and EcoCasa</strong></em></p><p>By giving homeowners and developers tailored financial support, Mexico shows that affordability and sustainability in the housing sector can go together. Under Mexico’s sustainable strategy called Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action, two programs stand out:</p><p>• Hipoteca Verde, run by Infonavit, which is both the national housing agency and the country’s single largest mortgage lender, offering additional mortgage lines for homeowners to install energy-efficient appliances.</p><p>• EcoCasa, run by Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal, which funds developers to design and build homes to passive standards that minimize energy use.</p><p>Both are financed through blended mechanisms combining national funds and international support. These programs reach low-income families, enable retrofits or efficient new builds, and embed sustainability into Mexico’s housing policy framework.</p></div><h4>4) Business Model Innovations</h4><p>Pilots often stall without scalable delivery models. Successful approaches feature shared-risk structures such as third-party ownership, joint ventures and performance-based contracts like those offered by energy service companies. Creating enabling conditions for one-stop-shops is also essential, as these entities streamline design, financing and construction, reduce transaction costs and ensure consistent project delivery. Together, these models lower market entry barriers for developers and households, build investor confidence and help move NZCRBs from isolated pilots to market scale.</p><div class=\"callout city-callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link city-callout-heading\"><strong>Case Studies</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\"><em><strong>Bootes, India — One-Stop Net-Zero Construction</strong></em></p><p class=\"secondary\">Bootes, a construction firm in India, uses a single turnkey contract to deliver sustainable buildings by managing engineering, procurement and construction. The use of prefabricated modules enables speed and cost savings. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.constructionweekonline.in/business/bootes-builds-net-zero-library-for-the-jhansi-development-authority\">public net-zero library</a> in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh was completed in just 90 days. The library generates 100% on-site energy, reducing carbon emissions by around 85%, cutting embodied carbon via use of locally sourced low-environmental impact materials, implementing water conservation through rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling, and integrating ventilation and daylighting strategies for healthy indoor environments. While the company works across building typologies, its prefabricated modules are relevant for residential housing too as they allow for rapid scale-up and reduced material waste and construction time and cost. The company guarantees energy performance, uses joint ventures to share capital risk and aligns projects with India’s national net-zero targets. By handling every stage under one contract, Bootes cuts red tape for residential housing and public infrastructure.</p><p class=\"secondary\"><em><strong>Energiesprong, Netherlands — Retrofit at Scale</strong></em></p><p>Energiesprong is a Dutch-born initiative that retrofits social housing to net-zero energy in under 10 days. Prefabricated solar façades and insulated rooftops are combined with 30-year energy performance contracts, allowing cost recovery through energy savings. Now operating in the UK, France and Germany, Energiesprong acts as a market facilitator, coordinating housing agencies, builders and financiers. Its strength lies in bulk procurement, standardization and public-private co-financing. Energiesprong proves that retrofitting thousands of homes can be as scalable and efficient as new construction.</p></div><h3>No One Size Fits All: Coordinating Models, Instruments and Institutions for NZCRBs</h3><p>Sustainable buildings require significant, long-term investment for both construction and ongoing operation, as maintaining strong environmental performance is an ongoing process. To scale NZCRBs, it is essential to combine funding strategies, business models and supportive policies or regulations in practical ways.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\"><noscript><img alt=\"table visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25163727/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Within the first two years, governments and partners should establish the foundation for scaling NZCRBs by carrying out baseline assessments of residential building stock and emissions, along with gap analyses to identify priority needs. Clear decarbonization targets should then be set and integrated into city and national climate action plans.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\"><noscript><img alt=\"table visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25223418/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Early pilot projects, as seen in Mexico, India and Northern Europe for example, should deploy financial tools such as green mortgages, subsidies for low-income households, and on-bill finance, allowing authorities to test which models are most effective for lowering upfront barriers across different contexts and building types. At this stage, it is also crucial to establish multi-level governance coordination platforms that bring together housing ministries, municipalities, utilities, developers, financiers and communities to ensure alignment and reduce fragmentation.</p><p>In the mid-term (3 to 5 years), the focus shifts to institutionalizing these foundational steps. Targets and lessons from pilots must be translated into enforceable building codes, performance standards and fiscal policies that move beyond voluntary adoption. Incentive-based programs, particularly those designed for low-income housing, can scale up proven approaches while ensuring equity. Building institutional capacity for monitoring, compliance and enforcement will be essential to ensure targets are not only aspirational, but achievable in practice.</p><p>By the long-term (next 10 years), NZCRB goals should be fully integrated into broader frameworks of urban planning, zoning, ESG reporting and fiscal reform. This period should see the expansion of climate-resilient housing programs, the implementation of life-cycle carbon requirements in planning rules and the full alignment of residential building standards with net-zero targets. International partnerships will be key to support technology transfer, innovation and access to advanced materials and designs. Finally, adaptation and equity must remain at the center of all strategies, ensuring that decarbonization delivers not only emissions reductions but also greater resilience and inclusive benefits for all communities.</p><p>Scaling NZCRBs is not just about building homes; it is about transforming entire systems by aligning policy, finance and innovative business models to unlock market-wide change. When inclusive governance is part of the status quo, countries can move from pilot projects to full-scale and widespread adoption.</p>",

Research continues to show that the lands they manage often <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/protecting-indigenous-land-rights-makes-good-economic-sense\">lose less tree cover</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">store more carbon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-and-local-community-land-rights-protect-biodiversity\">support higher biodiversity</a> than surrounding areas.</p><p>Yet a new report from WRI and WWF-Australia finds that these lands are disproportionately affected by increasing wildfires. Fueled by <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-fire-feedback-loop-explained\">climate change</a>, deforestation and decades of colonial-era policies that long restricted Indigenous rights to manage their lands — factors largely beyond the control of Indigenous Peoples and local communities — wildfire risk is rising for the very communities that have done the most to protect these forests, while contributing the least to climate change.</p><p>Here, we unpack the drivers behind these findings and explore how restoring autonomy to Indigenous Peoples and local communities can help reduce forest fire risk.</p><h3>Indigenous and Community Lands Face Rising Fire Risks</h3><p>The report analyzed satellite data from 2001 to 2024 in four fire-prone countries — Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States — and compared tree cover loss within forests from both fires and other causes across three land management types: Indigenous- and community-held lands, protected areas and all other lands.</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Who Are Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples? </strong></p><p>In the context of this report, local communities are groups of non-Indigenous individuals and families who live in the same area, share common interests and maintain strong social, cultural and economic ties to the land. They vary in size, identity, internal equity and the way they manage and use the land. This definition includes Afro-descendant communities.</p><p>Indigenous peoples are culturally distinct groups who self-identify as Indigenous and assert their rights and self-determination as stewards of their resources, environments and territories. They have deep ancestral ties to collectively owned lands, along with unique languages, knowledge systems, beliefs and livelihoods rooted in precolonial and pre-settler histories. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/equitable-development/indigenous-peoples-local-communities\">Learn more.</a></p></div><p>Across the four countries combined, Indigenous- and community-managed lands lost just 6% of tree cover over</p><div class=\"report-teaser gold-borders-medium alignright\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"234\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"234\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"234\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"234\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"234\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Front cover of the research paper Extreme Wildfires\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-09/wildfire-report-thumb_0.png?VersionId=ZCDEQLeQBB.IgyY0i.u9xtFNNk6A9SID&itok=nOAHD_6H\" width=\"234\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"text-wrapper\"><div class=\"h4 topic-tag\">Extreme wildfires: a growing threat — and a call to support indigenous and community leadership </div><p><a class=\"button small\" href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/extreme-wildfires-growing-threat-and-call-support-indigenous-and-community-leadership\">Download</a></p></div></div><p> the past two decades, compared with 11% in state-managed protected areas and 18% in lands under other management. In every country except Canada, Indigenous- and community-held lands saw less overall forest loss than other lands and, in most cases, even less than protected areas. In Canada, rates of forest loss were similar across all land management types.</p><p>Yet in Indigenous and community lands, a much greater share of the forest loss — about 62% — was driven by fire; slightly less than in protected areas but nearly twice the share seen in other lands. Most of these fires are not started by the communities themselves; many originate from land-clearing fires in surrounding areas, and, in some cases, fire is used deliberately to pressure or displace communities. This suggests these lands may face greater fire-related impacts as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires\">global forest fire activity continues to rise</a>.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24857383/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Indigenous Peoples and local communities are highly effective forest managers, playing a critical role in preventing deforestation and other permanent forms of forest loss. As a result, their lands see less overall forest loss than other land types, but a larger share of that loss is driven by wildfires. As wildfires increase around the world, these lands are increasingly affected by climate change, deforestation in surrounding areas and restrictive fire policies, all of which amplify wildfire risks.</p><p>Indigenous and community lands in Brazil are particularly vulnerable to rising fire activity, having seen a fifteenfold increase in fire-driven forest loss since 2001. Much of this loss occurred in the Amazon rainforest, where forest fires were once very rare but have become increasingly common due to decades of deforestation and climate change.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25048111/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Deforestation and Climate Change Fuel the Wildfire Crisis</h3><p>From the Amazon rainforest to Australia’s dry forests, extreme wildfires are no longer rare events. While fire can play a beneficial role in maintaining some ecosystems, climate change is making heat waves and droughts more frequent and severe, intensifying fire behavior and pushing ecosystems beyond their historical thresholds. In some regions, deforestation worsens these conditions by drying out forests and increases the risk that land-clearing fires will escape into surrounding areas.</p><h4>Deforestation drives fires in Brazil</h4><p>In Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/9/6/305\">deforestation is a key driver</a> of increasing wildfire activity. Clearing forests for agriculture fragments the landscape, allowing heat, wind and flammable grasses to spread deeper into intact forests. This makes them <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320712004466\">more fire-prone</a>, increasing the risk of land-clearing fires escaping under hot, dry conditions and igniting surrounding forests. El Niño-driven droughts <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2019377118\">compound these risks</a> by further drying out vegetation. Strong El Niño conditions leading into the 2016 and 2024 fire seasons, combined with high deforestation rates, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-forest-fires-2024\">fueled extreme wildfires</a> in both years. As the planet warms, such events are expected to become <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00199-z\">more frequent</a>, further amplifying wildfire risks across the country.</p><p>About 1.3 million hectares of forest — an area larger than the size of Puerto Rico — in Indigenous and community lands burned in those two years alone. Most of this loss occurred in the Amazon, home to <a href=\"https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/en/agencia-news/2184-news-agency/news/37575-brazil-has-1-7-million-indigenous-persons-and-more-than-half-of-them-live-in-the-legal-amazon\">more than half</a> the Indigenous population in Brazil.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3304663/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Climate change has increased fire risk in Australia, Canada and the US</h4><p>In southeastern Australia, where over 84,000 Indigenous Peoples <a href=\"https://cipr.cass.anu.edu.au/files/docs/2025/6/CAEPR_WP_no_134_2020_Williamson_Markham_Weir.pdf\">live in fire-affected areas</a>, extreme fires burned 1.2 million hectares of Indigenous-held forest during the devastating 2019–2020 fire season. Strikingly, Australia accounted for about 32% of all fire-driven tree cover loss on Indigenous and community lands across the four study countries, despite containing only 8% of their total forest area. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0716-1\">More than 20%</a> of Australia’s temperate broadleaf forests burned during that season — roughly 10 times the typical amount that burns each year. In this region, climate change has made extreme heat events at least <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/bushfires-in-australia-2019-2020/\">twice as likely</a>, increasing the risk of severe wildfires. </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24858417/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In Canada and the U.S., climate change is extending fire seasons and increasing the likelihood of extreme heat and drought, raising the risk of extreme wildfires like those <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/canada-wildfire-emissions\">seen in Canada</a> in 2023. Over the study period, roughly 2.3 million hectares of forests on Indigenous land burned across the two countries. </p><h3>How the Wildfire Crisis Impacts Communities </h3><p>Beyond forest loss, wildfires can devastate communities by destroying homes and sacred sites, displacing families, harming health and threatening <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6964492/pdf/41997_2018_Article_70.pdf\">food security and livelihoods</a>. For many Indigenous Peoples, the loss of nature to fire is deeply personal, often likened to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-this-grandmother-tree-connects-me-to-country-i-cried-when-i-saw-her-burned-129782\">losing a family member</a>.  </p><p>In Canada, where Indigenous Peoples make up <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220921/dq220921a-eng.htm\">just 5%</a> of the population, they accounted for <a href=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/Fulltext/WF23097\">more than a quarter</a> of all wildfire evacuees between 1980 and 2021. Of the 16 communities evacuated five or more times during this period, 14 were Indigenous reserves. About 90% of smoke-related evacuations involved communities where more than half the population identified as Indigenous, leaving many at <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.1409277\">severe risk</a> from smoke-related health impacts.</p><p>Studies have shown that Indigenous Peoples in <a href=\"https://cipr.cass.anu.edu.au/files/docs/2025/6/CAEPR_WP_no_134_2020_Williamson_Markham_Weir.pdf\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479725021668\">Brazil</a> and the <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205825\">U.S.</a> are also disproportionately vulnerable to wildfire impacts, which often compound existing social and economic inequities.</p><p>While Indigenous Peoples are among the most affected, they are also among the most knowledgeable about managing fire on their lands. Their traditional practices, rooted in long histories of observation, stewardship and place-based knowledge, offer proven strategies to reduce wildfire risk and build resilience against wildfires.</p><h3>Cultural Burning as a Traditional Management Solution </h3><p>Cultural burning, a traditional land management technique practiced by many Indigenous Peoples for thousands of years, involves <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.2736\">small but frequent</a>, low-intensity burns usually carried out during cooler, wetter periods. These burns reduce flammable fuel loads, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2105073118\">encourage biodiversity</a> and support livelihoods.</p><p>Unlike land-clearing fires or climate-fueled extreme wildfires, which tend to cause long-term ecological damage, cultural burning mimics natural fire cycles, such as those started by lightning, and helps prevent the buildup of dry, flammable vegetation. It also encourages new growth and maintains healthy, resilient landscapes.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1043\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"835\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"639\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"503\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"301\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Low intensity burning in a forest as part of an Indigenous cultural burning practice.\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-09/emma-renly-2-1.jpg?VersionId=KJpduFlKx8bSP19hOydvFcSRFuwtjfWP&itok=sRjoEuAM\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Low intensity burns, conducted as part of Indigenous cultural burning practices, reduce fuel loads, support ecosystem health and maintain traditional land management methods.

By treating all human-set fires the same, these policies ignored the ecological benefits and cultural significance of traditional burning, increasing the risk of more extreme wildfires. In Australia, for example, disrupting Indigenous fire management in southeastern forests led to the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/20530196211044630\">accumulation of flammable vegetation</a> and contributed to recent severe fires.</p><p>These policies also disregarded Indigenous sovereignty by restricting the use of Indigenous Peoples’ long-standing land management practices. Reversing this legacy requires recognizing and supporting Indigenous leadership in traditional fire stewardship.</p><h3>Reviving Traditional Fire Stewardship Shows Promise  </h3><p>Around the world, there is a slow but growing movement to restore cultural burning practices. Policy shifts in Australia, Brazil, Canada and the U.S., are beginning to recognize and support Indigenous-led fire programs that combine traditional knowledge with modern firefighting technique. Collaboration among Indigenous leaders, fire agencies and scientists can help ensure these methods are applied effectively and adapted to current climate challenges. Across these regions, several successful initiatives demonstrate how cultural burning can deliver ecological, social and economic benefits:</p><ul><li>In <strong>northern Australia, the </strong><a href=\"https://www.alfant.com.au/\"><strong>Arnhem Land Fire Abatement project</strong></a> conducts early dry season burns to prevent large, late-season wildfires. By reducing the area burned in hotter months, the program lowers greenhouse gas emissions, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13688790.2020.1832428\">generates carbon credits </a>to help fund community programs and shows how Indigenous-led fire management can deliver both environmental and economic benefits.</li><li>In <strong>Brazil, Indigenous fire brigades in the Xingu Indigenous Territory</strong> <a href=\"https://socioambiental.medium.com/a-meta-%C3%A9-inc%C3%AAndio-zero-60112e4c0520\">combine traditional fire management</a> with satellite monitoring to protect villages, crops and forest edges from escaped land-clearing fires. other Indigenous Peoples-led efforts coordinated with federal fire agencies, these actions help maintain biodiversity, safeguard food security and <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.14139\">strengthen community resilience</a> against extreme wildfires.</li><li>In <strong>British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous-led fire crews</strong> are partnering with provincial agencies to reintroduce cultural burning in fire-prone landscapes. Low-intensity burns are being used to <a href=\"https://prescribedfire.ca/cultural-burning/\">revitalize native plant species</a>, improve habitat for deer and other wildlife and reduce the buildup of flammable debris. These efforts not only lower wildfire risk but also reconnect communities with traditional fire stewardship practices.</li><li>In <strong>the U.S., the </strong><a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/blog/prescribed-fire-training-exchanges\"><strong>Prescribed Fire Training Exchange (TREX)</strong></a> builds capacity for cultural burning while strengthening coordination with fire agencies. In northern California, the U.S. Forest Service works with the Yurok and Karuk Tribes to apply traditional burning techniques that not only reduce wildfire risk but also <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42408-021-00092-6\">increase the availability of plants</a> used in basket weaving — restoring both ecological health and cultural traditions. </li></ul><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Reviving tradition to reduce wildfire risk</strong></p><p>In Oregon, U.S., Lomakatsi Restoration Project, a nonprofit restoration organization, shows how Indigenous-led stewardship reduces wildfire risks while strengthening communities. Partnering with the Klamath tribal community and other Tribes with ancestral lands in the region, and with support from WRI’s Cities4Forests program and other partners, Lomakatsi crews thin overcrowded forests, carry out cultural and prescribed burns and build fire breaks to prevent catastrophic fires like the 2020 Oregon Labor Day Fires, which destroyed homes and sacred sites near the rural town of Chiloquin.  </p><p>Beyond reducing the risk of catastrophic fire, these efforts protect water sources, restore wildlife habitat, build community resilience and strengthen the community-based tribal workforce. Lomakatsi trains and employs local Tribal members and youth in ecological restoration, creating stable career pathways in rural economies where opportunities can be limited. By partnering with tribal communities to revive cultural burning and blending it with modern restoration techniques, Lomakatsi Restoration Project underscores what research already shows: Indigenous peoples are among the most effective managers of fire-prone forests.</p><p><a href=\"https://lomakatsi.org/\">Learn more</a>.</p></div><p>Supporting Indigenous land rights and enabling community-led fire management are essential to reversing the disproportionate wildfire impacts on Indigenous and community lands. Reviving traditional fire stewardship is essential for containing wildfires and protecting land, but it won’t succeed in isolation. Alongside efforts to restore traditional practices, governments, NGOs and the private sector must create the enabling conditions for Indigenous-led solutions to thrive.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1025\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"820\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"628\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"495\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Young trees burst through the forest floor thanks to traditional fire management techniques that encourage biodiversity and new growth.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-09/david-clode_0.jpg?VersionId=J16tDoE_78pXUXuQkfUlsbm2ayan.ZRo&itok=CbznKbsW\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Traditional fire management techniques like cultural burning can help restore ecosystems and promote biodiversity by encouraging new growth. Image by David Clode/WRI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>To support these efforts, five key areas of action can help restore balance to fire-affected landscapes and empower communities in these regions:</p><h4>5 levers for action </h4><ol><li><strong>Securing and upholding Indigenous and community land rights</strong>. Legally recognized land rights and reversing colonial-era fire suppression policies give communities the authority to manage forests using traditional practices. Recognized, protected and enforced rights allow communities to prevent illegal logging, restrict harmful land use and invest in long-term fire prevention that help <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/4-ways-indigenous-and-community-lands-can-reduce-emissions\">reduce forest carbon emissions</a>.</li><li><strong>Funding and training Indigenous- and community-led fire brigades. </strong>These brigades are often the first — and sometimes only — responders in remote regions. Long-term funding ensures they can maintain trained teams, operate year-round and access essential tools like protective firefighting clothing, water trucks and communications equipment. Investing in these brigades strengthens local capacity to prevent, detect and respond quickly to fires.</li><li><strong>Expanding access to fire monitoring tools and early warning systems.</strong> Modern satellite-based tools can alert communities to new fire outbreaks, illegal burns and deforestation in near-real time. Paired with training, these platforms enable communities to act quickly, share evidence with authorities and hold perpetrators accountable. Expanding access also requires reliable connectivity, technical support and local-language interfaces wherever possible.</li><li><strong>Ending deforestation in critical biodiversity areas</strong>. In many regions, wildfire risk is closely linked to deforestation. Stopping deforestation not only preserves biodiversity and carbon storage but also removes a primary cause of uncontrolled fires. Policies to halt illegal clearing, enforce supply-chain accountability and promote sustainable land use are critical for long-term fire prevention.</li><li><strong>Taking action on climate change.</strong> Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential to preventing the hotter, drier conditions that lengthen fire seasons and increase fire intensity. Without urgent climate action, other fire prevention measures will be less effective in the long term. </li></ol><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Tools to support Indigenous- and community-led fire management </strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Platforms like <a href=\"https://www.landmarkmap.org/map\">LandMark</a> map the boundaries and legal status of Indigenous- and community-held lands worldwide to increase awareness of the threats they face and their contributions to sustainably managing the environment. Mapping these territories enable Indigenous Peoples and local communities to document land encroachments and advocate for stronger legal protections. Other platforms like <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch </a>are also increasingly being <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/grants-and-fellowships/projects/?projectId=114\">used by Indigenous Peoples</a> to identify and respond to wildfires in near real-time using satellite-based fire alerts that provide timely information on active fires and their locations. </p></div><h3>A Rights-Based Path to Fire-Resilient Forests</h3><p>Extreme wildfires are not inevitable. Tackling their root causes — deforestation, climate change and the suppression of traditional fire stewardship — can protect forests and the communities who depend on them.</p><p>Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not simply stakeholders in this effort; they are leaders with deep ecological knowledge and proven fire management strategies. Supporting their autonomy, rights and solutions is both a matter of justice, and one of the most effective strategies we have to safeguard biodiversity, protect carbon stores and build climate resilience in an era of escalating wildfire risk. </p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>New York (September 24, 2025)</strong> — The <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\">High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy </a>(Ocean Panel) today committed to five more years of urgent, coordinated ocean action, backed by a <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/op-workplan/\">bold new workplan</a> through 2030. The Panel — comprising of 18 heads of state and government from coastal and island nations — works to accelerate progress toward a healthy ocean, resilient communities and a sustainable blue economy, amid mounting threats from climate change, overfishing and biodiversity loss. </p><p>At its annual meeting, held at the United Arab Emirates’ Permanent Mission to the UN in New York, the Ocean Panel unveiled a renewed agenda focused on moving decisively from commitments to action — and from ambition to global leadership. The updated workplan prioritizes strengthening global ocean data systems, which remain underfunded despite being essential for informed, sustainable decision-making. It also includes launching a new ocean finance working group to help mobilize the estimated $550 billion needed each year to support the shift to a sustainable ocean economy, by unlocking investments from both public and private sectors.  </p><p>Efforts will also be intensified to accelerate the roll out of Sustainable Ocean Plans, with the goal of achieving 100% sustainable management of the world’s national waters. Panel leaders are calling on all ocean and coastal states to join them in this ambition through the 100% Alliance. </p><p>The announcement builds on momentum from the 2025 UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France (UNOC3), where world leaders underscored the ocean’s role in tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity and sustainable development. Themed <strong>“The Road from Nice to Belém and Beyond: Advancing Ocean Action for Climate, Nature and People”</strong>, the Ocean Panel meeting included discussions on national ocean climate actions and collective progress toward the Paris Agreement goals.  </p><p>“The ocean’s future depends on sustained global cooperation and the Ocean Panel’s next five years will play a critical role in driving it,” said <strong>Surangel S. Whipps Jr., President of Palau and Ocean Panel Co-chair</strong>. “The threats facing the ocean are too great for short-term efforts. They require long-term commitment, bold leadership and impactful delivery. The new workplan will ensure the Ocean Panel continues to at least 2030, with a strong focused on improving ocean data, advancing sustainable fisheries and boosting the ocean’s role in tackling climate change.” </p><p>“The Ocean Panel has significantly raised global ambition and deepened our understanding of how to sustainably use and protect our ocean,” said <strong>Jonas Gahr Støre, Prime Minister of Norway and Ocean Panel Co-chair</strong>. “However, the ocean continues to suffer from mounting challenges. The Ocean Panel will work together and with partners to scale up solutions that protect nature, support people and create jobs, and strengthen the ocean’s role in tackling climate change.” </p><p>Ocean Panel members reaffirmed support for recent developments in global ocean governance, including the High Seas Treaty reached the 60 ratifications needed to enter into force last week. 11 Ocean Panel members have ratified the treaty so far, complementing their commitment to 100% sustainable ocean management.     <br />Members also welcomed the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, ratified on September 15, 2025. This critical agreement targets harmful subsidies that encourage overfishing, setting the stage for further actions to protect vulnerable fish stocks. </p><p>“It’s clear that we must place the ocean at the heart of global action, recognizing its vital role in regulating our planet, sustaining biodiversity, and supporting communities. That is why the UAE championed ocean–climate action as hosts of COP28 and is now continuing its long tradition of marine and coastal conservation through its Sustainable Ocean Plan journey as part of the Ocean Panel,” said <strong>Her Excellency Ms. Razan Al Mubarak, IUCN President and UAE’s Sherpa to the Ocean Panel</strong>. “Nature conservation — from mangroves to marine life — is central to sustainable ocean planning. As we look ahead to the IUCN World Conservation Congress in the UAE and COP30 in Belém, this collective action will be critical to delivering the just, inclusive, and sustainable ocean economy the world urgently needs.”  </p><p><strong>Key priorities of the Ocean Panel’s new 5-year workplan:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>100% Sustainable ocean management:</strong> Supporting member countries to complete and implement Sustainable Ocean Plans (SOPs), while continuing to call on all coastal and ocean states to join this commitment through the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance campaign</a></li><li><strong>Global Ocean Observations: </strong>Securing reliable, accessible ocean data by expanding observation systems and calling for collective investment in this critical global resource.  </li><li><strong>Ocean-Climate nexus: </strong>Expanding nature-based solutions such as mangrove and seagrass restoration, and championing the integration of ocean-based solutions into countries’ national climate plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-brazil-and-france-launch-new-global-challenge-put-ocean-center-climate-action\">Blue NDC Challenge</a>.</li><li><strong>Sustainable fisheries and aquatic foods</strong>: Advancing climate-resilient seafood systems that support nutrition, livelihoods and economic security for coastal communities.</li><li><strong>Mobilizing finance: </strong>Addressing the $550 billion annual ocean finance gap by unlocking scalable, inclusive investment solutions aligned with sustainability goals.</li><li><strong>Equity and inclusion:</strong> Embedding equity into all aspects of governance, and elevating the voices of Indigenous peoples, women, youth and local communities.</li></ul><p><strong>About the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy </strong><br />Co-chaired by Norway and Palau, the Ocean Panel includes Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau, Portugal, Seychelles, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Together, these 18 nations represent 42% of the world’s coastlines, 37% of global EEZs, 18% of the world’s fisheries, 20% of the world’s shipping fleet. The Ocean Panel is supported by the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Ocean. Based on the shared understanding of the need to improve the state of the ocean, the countries in the Ocean Panel are committed to producing national sustainable ocean plans with the aim of sustainably managing 100% of the ocean area under national jurisdiction.

      "link": "https://www.wri.org/update/mexico-india-advance-net-zero-climate-resilient-buildings",
      "pubDate": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 08:00:00 EDT",
      "description": "<p>Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/all-net-zero-built-environment\">All in for a Net Zero Built Environment</a> initiative, WRI Mexico, WRI India and partners worked closely with local governments, developers and community stakeholders to advance net-zero carbon and resilient buildings (NZCRBs) in four cities. These local interventions are proving essential to mainstreaming NZCRBs, building capacity, and launching demonstration projects in additional cities and at the national level.</p><h3>Advancing Local Action with Global Impact</h3><p>Buildings <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-status-report-for-buildings-and-construction-2019\">are responsible </a>for 36% of energy use and nearly 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions globally. Without rapid decarbonization, the sector’s emissions could double by 2050 due to urbanization, population growth and increased demand for cooling as the planet warms. In this context, net-zero carbon and resilient buildings offer a major opportunity to align climate goals with economic and social benefits. Alongside cutting emissions, they can reduce energy bills, improve indoor air quality, lower urban temperatures and enhance disaster resilience.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">Learn More: <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/scaling-net-zero-carbon-and-resilient-buildings\">4 Levers to Help Scale NZCRBs</a></p><p class=\"secondary\">Despite progress in some areas, NZCRBs still make up less than 1% of global building stock. We unpack the major barriers and lay out four levers that can help them scale faster. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/scaling-net-zero-carbon-and-resilient-buildings\">Read more.</a></p></div><p>Since 2023, the All in for a Net Zero Built Environment initiative has worked with cities in India and Mexico to accelerate NZCRB implementation through the development of national <a href=\"https://worldgbc.org/buildinglife/buildinglife-roadmaps/\">whole life carbon roadmaps</a> and City Action Plans. These roadmaps and action plans not only chart technical solutions in the buildings sector, but also identify the policy, finance, governance shifts and partnerships needed to make these solutions mainstream. Participating cities and countries gain access to tailored technical assistance, peer-to-peer learning and global advocacy platforms to raise ambition and unlock investment in NZCRBs. The initiative also works to link local pilot projects with national strategies and global best practices. This helps ensure that innovations can be scaled, adapted and replicated — bridging the gap between isolated success stories and market transformation.</p><p>The program puts a strong focus on how NZCRBs can unlock co-benefits and spur economic growth. Mexico, for example, has positioned energy-efficient construction as a competitive asset that can reduce operating costs, attract green investment and create new jobs. Additional benefits highlighted in India include improving public health through better air quality, reducing energy poverty and mitigating extreme heat in cities.</p><p><strong>Through the All in for a Net Zero Built Environment initiative, both Mexico and India are seeing local action spur national momentum toward a net-zero built environment.</strong></p><h3>Mexico: A National Roadmap Takes Shape</h3><p>In Mexico, WRI and Sustentabilidad para Mexico (SUMe) supported the cities of Monterrey and Hermosillo in developing City Action Plans, building on their near-term climate plans and decarbonization commitments. The cities identified transformative actions for the buildings sector from a whole lifecycle of carbon perspective and mapped them according to their urgency and priority.</p><p>These local efforts have helped catalyze a broader debate on how to embed net-zero targets into national housing subsidies, public works tenders and building codes. They have also fed into a series of working groups led by WRI México, SUMe and local stakeholders to design <a href=\"https://es.wri.org/noticias/hacia-un-entorno-construido-neto-cero-wri-mexico-y-aliados-trazan-hoja-de-ruta-nacional\">Mexico’s National Roadmap</a> to decarbonize the built environment through the full building lifecycle. A national workshop in July 2025 convened more than 100 leaders from the construction sector, government, academia and civil society. This milestone event marked the culmination of a year-long process of technical studies, stakeholder consultations and scenario analysis designed to chart a credible pathway for decarbonizing Mexico’s buildings sector by mid-century.</p><p>The new roadmap sets out clear actions for the federal administration, including the adoption of mandatory energy codes, incentives for retrofits and low-carbon materials, and public procurement policies that prioritize NZCRBs. By linking climate ambition with economic opportunity, the plan positions Mexico to reduce building energy use by up to 35%, cut operating costs for households and businesses, stimulate demand for national green industries and create thousands of skilled jobs.</p><p>Participants stressed that without coordinated implementation across ministries and levels of government, the roadmap’s targets will remain aspirational, making cross-sector collaboration essential to turn vision into action. Ministries responsible for energy, housing and industry have already expressed interest in aligning their sectoral strategies with the roadmap’s milestones.</p><h3>India: Cities Lead the Way on NZCRBs</h3><p>WRI India and the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) worked with two fast-growing cities, Nashik and Thiruvananthapuram, to turn national climate targets into actionable local plans for NZCRBs.</p><p>In Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, WRI collaborated with municipal officials, state agencies, architects and community groups to co-develop and launch a <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/green-building-roadmap-rolled-out-in-tpuram/articleshow/122372442.cms\">City-level NZCRB Action Plan</a>. The plan identifies 20 priority actions spanning the entire building lifecycle, including developing carbon databases for materials, introducing green procurement guidelines, integrating NZCRB principles into urban zoning and building permits, and adopting demolition waste recovery systems. Thiruvananthapuram’s commitment builds on its existing 17 MW of municipal rooftop solar capacity and seeks to extend energy efficiency gains to both new and existing buildings. The plan also incorporates climate resilience measures to counteract rising urban heat and monsoon flooding risks.</p><p>Nashik, a historic city in Maharashtra, is seeing unprecedented infrastructure investments driven by the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, making this a critical moment for the city to consider its carbon footprint in the buildings and construction sector. Nashik has already established its Climate Action Plan, yet this does not address embodied carbon emissions. In the newly developed action plan for building sector decarbonization, WRI India and Nashik’s local government set transformative actions that address both operational and embodied carbon, such as mainstreaming the use of renewable energy, adopting energy efficiency measurement in all building types, establishing a database of low and zero-carbon materials that are locally produced, and collaborating with academic institutions to provide skill development programs related to building decarbonization.</p><p>With India’s urban population projected to reach 600 million by 2036, these interventions aim to help curb rising building emissions, which already make up 32% of the country’s total. At the same time, they can enhance liveability and equity for a rapidly urbanizing population. The two cities’ experiences will inform similar roadmaps in other urban areas, creating a blueprint for integrating climate, development and housing priorities.</p><h3>From Roadmap to Rollout</h3><p><strong>The next phase in both countries focuses on implementation and scale.</strong></p><p>In Mexico, stakeholders are working to establish a national steering committee that will oversee roadmap execution, track progress and coordinate policy across ministries. Pilot projects will be launched in public buildings to demonstrate cost-effective pathways to NZCRBs, with the goal of attracting blended finance and private sector participation.</p><p>In India, Thiruvananthapuram will move from planning to pilot implementation, starting with municipal facilities and affordable housing projects that integrate solar PV, passive cooling and efficient materials.</p><p>Both initiatives will require sustained capacity building for local governments, training programs for construction trades and stronger data systems to monitor building performance. WRI and partners will continue to facilitate knowledge exchange between cities and countries, ensuring lessons from early adopters inform global standards and funding priorities. Key areas for future collaboration include:</p><ol><li><strong>Recommend and, where appropriate, found, steering committees</strong> to monitor, coordinate and enforce NZCRB standards in Mexico and India.</li><li><strong>Develop pathways to launch pilot projects</strong> under the City Action Plans and roadmaps to demonstrate scalable NZCRB delivery across public and private assets and infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Share a compendium of international best practices to mobilize private sector finance </strong>through incentives, blended finance and business model pilots, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUT5ZZaPF9M\">learn from experts in the field</a>.</li><li><strong>Evaluate and iterate</strong>, using monitoring frameworks embedded in city plans and national strategies to refine policy and expand impact.</li></ol><p>The All in for a Net Zero Built Environment initiative reflects a pivotal inflection point: from defining net-zero carbon and resilient buildings to building actionable roadmaps grounded in local realities and ready to be implemented at scale. Globally, the initiative has expanded its network to include a consortium of local and global partners (such as the World Green Building Council, local green building councils and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development) and participating jurisdictions. This provides a platform for cities, countries and industry representatives to share lessons on financing retrofits, scaling renewable integration and overcoming institutional barriers.</p><p>Early impacts demonstrate that roadmaps are not just documents — when co-created with stakeholders and tied to concrete investment and policy measures, they can become powerful accelerators of market change.</p><div><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/all-net-zero-built-environment\"><strong>All in for a Net Zero Built Environment</strong></a>, supported by the We Mean Business Coalition, brings together key global partners — led by WRI, the World Green Building Council and World Business Council for Sustainable Development — to accelerate the implementation of net-zero carbon and resilient buildings by enhancing cross-sector and multi-level coordination. The objective is to accelerate market transformation and transition to a healthier, greener, more inclusive built environment.</div>",

      "title": "STATEMENT: Now is the Time to Enforce, not Delay, the EU Deforestation Regulation",
      "link": "https://www.wri.org/news/statement-time-to-enforce-not-delay-eu-deforestation-regulation",
      "pubDate": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 04:53:00 EDT",
      "description": "<p><strong>Brussels / The Hague (September 24, 2025)</strong> — The European Commission has once again proposed delaying the enforcement of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), pushing back its start date for a second year in a row. The new implementation date would be late December 2026. By postponing enforcement yet again, the EU risks undermining the credibility of the law, its reliability as a partner to commodity-producing countries and its global climate commitments.</p><p>The regulation is designed to prevent commodities linked to deforestation and forest degradation – such as coffee, cocoa, soy, beef, leather, palm oil, rubber and wood – from being sold on the EU market. The EUDR is one of the most comprehensive environmental laws ever passed, with the potential to reshape global supply chains. </p><p><strong>Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice-President and Regional Director for Europe of World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“The European Commission’s new proposal to delay the EUDR is troubling. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-global-forest-loss-shatters-records-2024-fueled-massive-fires\">Forest loss reached record levels</a> in 2024, with <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">6.7 million hectares</a> of tropical rainforest destroyed — an area nearly the size of Ireland. Every minute, we lose the equivalent of 18 football fields of tropical forest. At a time when Europe itself is reeling from extreme summer heatwaves and record forest loss due to devastating wildfires, postponing protections for forests sends exactly the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-changes-threaten-effectiveness-eu-deforestation-regulation\">wrong signal</a>.</p><p>“The Commission argues that certain systems aren’t ready yet. Yet all the elements legally mandated in the regulation to support implementation — IT systems, guidance, FAQs, and benchmarking — have been in place for months. Many businesses have already invested in traceability, from using satellite monitoring to training smallholder farmers. Producer countries such as Malaysia, Ghana and Vietnam are also building national systems to support compliance. Delaying for the second time undermines companies that have proactively prepared, sending the wrong market signal thereby creating <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/eu-deforestation-regulation-compliance-underway\">additional uncertainty for businesses</a>. </p><p>“Regardless of the delay, the EUDR, which already passed through the full legislative cycle in 2023, should remain as is. There is political pressure to erode the law by, for example, introducing a so-called ‘no-risk’ country category. Such a move would make the EUDR much less effective as it would undermine the due diligence system, which is at the core of the EUDR. Such a clause would create large loopholes for deforestation-linked products. Our <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\">analysis</a> shows that exempting EU Member States or other countries from the declaration requirement would allow unscrupulous actors to launder products linked to deforestation — such as leather from Brazil — into EU supply chains.</p><p>“The EU accounts for 13–16% of global deforestation through imports, despite having just 7% of the world’s population, giving it a disproportionate responsibility.  We call on the EU Council and EU Parliament to reject this delay and move forward with the enforcement as planned. Further delay would not ease implementation challenges; it would jeopardize forests, climate goals, Europe’s credibility.”</p>",
