      "description": "<p>When Alex Tawiah and Georgina Nyarko first heard about beekeeping on their cocoa farm, they were skeptical. Could bees really help them earn a steady income?  </p><p>They put their misgivings aside and decided to work with Goshen Global Vision, a non-profit that helps small farmers build sustainable livelihoods. With training and a small investment, the couple installed eight beehives on their land. They also worked to plant and protect native trees. While many farmers clear natural vegetation to make space for more cocoa plants, Goshen explained that bees need trees for food and shelter, and the shade they provide can even help cocoa trees thrive.</p><p>A year later, the hives have brought so much more than honey to the small cocoa farm.</p><p>Alex and Georgina now earn extra money from harvesting and selling honey from their hives. Bees help pollinate  their cocoa trees, while on-farm trees add nutrients to the soil. The two combined have helped increase the couple’s cocoa yields, further boosting incomes.  </p><p>“I was weary of keeping bees in the farm due to the safety risks it posed to our children who accompany us,” said Nyarko. “But we were assured of protective clothing for safe apiculture. This was a good decision.” Today, Alex and Georgina’s land is part of a growing agroforestry movement across Ghana’s Cocoa Belt. By preserving and planting trees alongside cocoa, farmers are not only restoring degraded land; they’re creating more resilient farms and new income streams.</p><article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJeF2Z72_b4\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch From Cocoa Tree to Chocolate: Learn how Ghanaian Farmers are Ensuring Sustainability of Cocoa\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Ghana’s Cocoa Economy at a Crossroads</h3><p>Ghana is the world’s second-largest cocoa exporter, <a href=\"https://ghana-cocoa-belt-worldresources.hub.arcgis.com/pages/instructions\">bringing in over <strong>$2.2 billion a year</strong></a><strong>. </strong>But much of that success has come at the expense of the country’s forests.</p><p>Between 2001 and 2017, <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/GHA/\">illegal cocoa farming stripped away more than <strong>13% of Ghana’s forest cover</strong></a>. Without trees to hold soil in place, wind and rain washed away nutrient-rich topsoil. Crop yields dropped, deepening poverty.</p><p>These compounding problems further strained forests and the farmers who relied on them.  “Most times [people] need money, they go to the forest and then they cut the native species and hunt for game,” said <strong>Mary Perpetua Kwakuyi</strong>, executive director of Goshen Global Vision. For example, farmers facing dwindling crop yields sometimes cut trees and sell the timber or charcoal to make ends meet. “Restoration without livelihood is just a conversation,” Kwakuyi said.</p><p>In other words: People don’t destroy forests because they want to; they do it because they have no alternative.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Women with watering cans.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/women-pado_0.jpg?VersionId=l0jpfxNp7qyfOFR010uzrQTMx50mLTEB&itok=mp87eYMK\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Women with the Private Afforestation Development Organization (PADO) water young plants in Ghana’s Cocoa Belt.

Once considered an afterthought, agroforestry is now central to Goshen’s work in Ghana’s Western Region. The organization trains local farmers to grow trees, maintain hives and harvest honey. Their goal is to turn restored trees into income-generating assets.</p><p>“The bees give them a reason to leave the trees standing,” Kwayuki explained.</p><p>Goshen is one of many organizations working with WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/restore-local\">Restore Local initiative</a>. Its financing arm, TerraFund has invested in 15 non-profits and five local enterprises in Ghana's Cocoa Belt with the support of founding partners One Tree Planted and Realize Impact. So far, the groups have planted 4.1 million trees and created 6,400 jobs, with 9,300 hectares under restoration.  Collectively, they’re moving closer to achieving Ghana’s national goal of restoring 2 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 under the <a href=\"https://afr100.org/\">African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100)</a>.</p><p>But beyond the numbers, restoration champions’ powerful stories paint a vibrant picture of what investing in local solutions means for the people and nature in this region.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1054\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"885\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"678\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"534\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"320\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Goshen Global Vision.\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/goshen-global-vision_0.jpg?VersionId=9WjtuMiGb3KlsE0d0Psmr9MwpHSTdIDN&itok=pdPL8uHN\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Goshen Global Vision works closely with WRI’s Restore Local initiative to restore land through beekeeping, agroforestry and other measures.

Degradation had stripped the reserve of its topsoil, making it almost impossible for any of Bigiba’s crops to flourish.</p><p>Five years ago, he joined a growing group of farmers restoring degraded reserves by planting teak, Ofram and Cedrela trees. These previously endangered native and commercial species are now coming back — a boon for the area’s farmers.</p><p>“I believe it is my responsibility to plant trees to protect the land,” Bigiba said. “With more trees, we have better rainfall, and this means better crop yield and more money.”</p><p>Other farmers find that agroforestry brings resilience.</p><p>Ghana’s climate is changing. Rainfall is more erratic, droughts are lengthening, and the heat is rising. For cocoa, a notoriously sensitive crop, this instability is a threat. Trees offer a kind of buffer.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1000\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Woman with plants.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/woman-with-plants-fanteakwa-cocoa-cooperative-union_0.jpg?VersionId=bhKO.lu5jhCff_Ic1DjkyJ.CoN13wYkX&itok=52_2eDEf\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A woman cares for plants as part of the Fanteakwa Cocoa Cooperative Union.

By mixing crops instead of “monocropping,” farmers enrich the land while also protecting themselves from the ever-shifting cocoa market. When cocoa prices fluctuate, fruit and timber provide an alternative. Meanwhile, shade from the trees helps stabilize the microclimate for heat- and sun-sensitive cocoa trees.</p><p>Kwabena Napoleon, a cocoa farmer in the Western region, switched from monocropping to agroforestry. “The erosion was so bad, the soil would be washed away by the rain,” he said. “But now, the trees hold it.

The same week, the Department of the Interior said it would open <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-unleashes-american-coal-power-bold-move-advance-trump-administration\">13.1 million acres</a> of federal land to coal mining, while the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-repeal-biden-harris-epa-regulations-power-plants-which-if-finalized-would\">proposed</a> weakening regulations meant to limit toxic water and air pollution from coal plants.</p><p>These are the latest in a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-625-million-investment-reinvigorate-and-expand-americas-coal#:~:text=100%25%20natural%20gas.-,Background%3A,-To%20date%2C%20the\">series of maneuvers</a> intended to shore up U.S. coal in the face of rising energy costs, reliability concerns and growing power demand (not least from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">new data centers</a>).</p><p>Yet, coal is not an economical answer to energy security. Evidence shows that keeping old plants online is <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies_Cost-of-Federal-Mandates-to-Retain-Fossil-Burning-Power-Plants.pdf#page=6\">already costing utilities millions</a> — costs that are passed onto ratepayers. While these plants might bolster power supply in the short term, they will ultimately drive up electricity bills, hurt Americans' health and accelerate dangerous climate change.</p><p>The good news is that there are cleaner, more reliable sources available today that can meet the country's rising demand more affordably.</p><h3>Coal Has Declined as Cheaper, Cleaner Power Sources Emerged</h3><p>Two decades ago, nearly half the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,0,1&fuel=vtvv&geo=g&sec=g&linechart=ELEC.GEN.GEO-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.TSN-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.BIO-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.SUN-US-99.A&columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A&map=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A&freq=A&start=2005&end=2024&chartindexed=0&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&columnvalues=0&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0\">United States</a>' electricity came from coal. Today, only about 15% does.</p><p>The single biggest reason for this shift is that other power sources became more competitive. <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/the_effect_of_fuel_prices_environmental_regulations_and_other_factors_on_u.s._coal_productions_2008-2016.pdf\">Natural gas prices fell</a> relative to coal as the U.S. ramped up shale gas production, making coal plants less economic. This helped accelerate momentum <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/what-killing-us-coal-industry\">away from coal and toward natural gas</a> around the early 2010s. Protective environmental and climate regulations have also made it more expensive to operate highly polluting coal plants.</p><p>In tandem, plummeting renewable prices over the last decade and state policies encouraging adoption led to rapid clean energy deployment. Wind and solar <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-and-solar-overtook-coal-on-the-us-grid-in-2024\">overtook coal</a> in the U.S. power mix for the first time in 2024, together contributing 17% of the country's electricity compared to coal's 15%.</p><p>Critically, these sources are not just cheaper than coal, but also cleaner and safer. Coal is the <a href=\"https://understand-energy.stanford.edu/energy-resources/fossil-fuel-energy/coal\">most carbon-intensive fossil fuel</a> and emits toxic pollutants that can lead to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-172/pdfs/2011-172.pdf\">lung disease and other health risks</a>.

Similarly, an April <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-the-reliability-and-security-of-the-united-states-electric-grid/\">executive order</a> directed DOE to evaluate processes for using its emergency powers to improve grid reliability. As a result of this order, the agency has taken action to keep fossil fuel plants slated for retirement in operation, including the <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open\">J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-constellation-pjm-emergency-eddystone/749520/\">Eddystone oil- and gas-burning plant in Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>These measures come at a steep price. With spending needed on retrofits and upgrades, the cost of coal power is rising as aging plants become more expensive to operate and maintain. This means that keeping old plants open can be costly. Consumers Energy — the majority owner of the J.H. Campbell power station that was ordered to remain online past its May 2025 retirement date — <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000201533/000081115625000071/cms-20250630.htm\">reported that it spent $29 million</a> in the first 38 days of a DOE order to keep the plant open. At this rate, the cost to keep it running is estimated to be about $279 million a year.</p><p>Rising generation costs ultimately translate to higher rates for electricity customers, contributing to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/16/nx-s1-5502671/electricity-bill-high-inflation-ai\">surging energy bills</a> for U.S. households and businesses. One recent report estimates that efforts to prevent large fossil fuel power plants from retiring could <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/document/report-the-cost-of-federal-mandates-to-retain-fossil-burning-power-plants\">cost ratepayers about $3.1 billion a year</a> by the end of 2028.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25546913/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>There Are Better Ways to Meet US Power Demand</h3><p>More coal is not the answer to today's energy challenges. What the U.S. needs to keep prices down, meet rising demand and stay competitive on a global scale is: <em>1) </em>to build wind, solar and batteries rapidly now, because they are the quickest to install and least expensive source of energy in many regions; and <em>2)</em> to scale up clean, firm power — a variety of low-carbon sources, including next-generation geothermal, nuclear and hydropower, that can operate around the clock.</p><p>Investing in clean energy today makes good financial sense. The cost of building new renewables <a href=\"https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus-lcoeplus/\">can be less than operating coal</a>; indeed, research has shown that the majority of U.S. coal plants would be <a href=\"https://energyinnovation.org/report/the-coal-cost-crossover-3-0/\">more expensive to continue running</a> than to replace with local wind or solar. Scaling these sources will also be key to supporting the administration's goal of \"energy dominance\" in a world that's <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2025/executive-summary\">increasingly investing in renewables</a>.</p><p>Despite current headwinds, including the early phase-out of key federal tax credits, U.S. wind and solar are still expected to grow in the coming years. In its latest <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-july-2025\">energy infrastructure report</a>, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forecasts that the U.S. will add 92.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar and 22.6 GW of new wind between August 2025 and July 2028 — enough to power more than 25 million homes.

      "description": "<p>Countries today face a fundamental challenge: how to grow their economies and meet development goals without repeating the planet-warming patterns of the past.</p><p>Historically, rapid economic growth has come at the cost of high greenhouse gas emissions. As the world works to secure a stable climate and safe future, decoupling the two is essential — particularly for emerging economies in places like southeast Asia, where energy demand and emissions are rising fast.</p><p>This challenge comes into sharp focus in Indonesia, which stands at a defining moment. Southeast Asia's largest economy and the world's fourth-most-populous country has two ambitious goals: to grow its GDP 8% per year by 2029 and reach net-zero emissions by 2060.</p><p>These objectives may seem to be at odds — and if the country continues on its current fossil-powered trajectory, they are. But this isn't the only way.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition\">New WRI research</a> shows that Indonesia can achieve both climate<em> and</em> economic goals if it doubles down on clean energy and energy efficiency in the coming years. While the upfront investment is significant, the payoff is even greater: not just lower emissions, but also millions of new jobs, stronger energy security, cleaner air and better health.</p><p>These findings align with a <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2020.1724070\">growing body of research</a> that shows climate action can grow economies while improving lives globally. Indonesia now has the opportunity to demonstrate that, with the right policies and decisive action, clean energy can be key to a more prosperous future.</p><h3>Modeling a Path to Green Growth</h3><p>At present, Indonesia's energy needs are largely <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/indonesia/energy-mix\">met by fossil fuels</a>: 36% of its power came from coal and 26% from oil in 2023. Raising GDP 8% per year by 2029 would massively ramp up demand, particularly as the government prioritizes energy-intensive industries such as nickel, iron and steel. Meeting this growing demand with the country's current carbon-intensive power mix risks rapidly driving up emissions.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25514396/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In parallel to its economic goals, Indonesia has set out plans to shift away from fossil energy and toward clean power. Its latest Electricity Supply Business Plan (<em>Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik</em>, or RUPTL) aims to expand renewable power to 34.3% of the total power mix by 2034. The country is also part of a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), which aims to mobilize $20 billion in international finance to support this transition. However, Indonesia is not on track to meet its clean energy goals and has even revised its renewable energy targets downward in recent years.</p><p>Our research sought to answer a key question: What if the country pursued its economic goals and an ambitious energy transition in tandem?</p><div class=\"report-teaser gold-borders-medium alignright\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"2227\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1782\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1365\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"1075\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Understanding the Socioeconomic Implications of Indonesia’s Net Zero Energy Transition covershot\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition_0.jpg?VersionId=0mhwO5V8ooeG9yEueBo1.h0l1Ww0lZOk&itok=CDz9JULe\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"text-wrapper\"><div class=\"h4 topic-tag\">Understanding the socioeconomic implications of Indonesia's net-zero energy transition </div><p><a class=\"button small\" href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/understanding-socioeconomic-implications-indonesias-net-zero-energy-transition\">Download</a></p></div></div><p>Building on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/zero-emissions-increasing-climate-ambition-indonesia\">earlier modeling</a> that informed Indonesia's net-zero goal, we looked at what would happen if the country increased clean energy and energy efficiency as outlined under its JETP agreement. Laid out in the 2023 Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP), this pathway includes retiring two fossil fuel power plants by 2035; achieving 34% renewable energy by 2030; and implementing energy efficiency measures. (These could include measures like introducing minimum energy performance standards and labeling programs that promote energy-saving appliances, and improving motor-driven factory equipment and industrial machinery to reduce power consumption.)</p><p>Under this \"JETP scenario,\" new clean energy and improved energy efficiency would still deliver enough power to drive 8% GDP growth per year — while also reducing emissions and avoiding the environmental, health and fiscal costs that come with fossil fuel dependence.</p><p>With continued green energy investment, power sector emissions would peak in 2034 at about 324 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) and drop to just 13.2 MtCO2e by 2050 — consistent with Indonesia's goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2060. By contrast, under a business-as-usual scenario, power sector emissions would rise to 1.86 billion tonnes by 2050 — nearly six times what the sector emitted in 2022.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3348267/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Data</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Our analysis used an adaptation of the Indonesia Vision to 2045 (IV2045) model — developed under the country's <a href=\"https://lcdi-indonesia.id/\">Low Carbon Development Initiative</a> — to simulate high economic growth pathways either under existing energy systems or more efficient, low-carbon ones.

Our study finds that scaling up renewables in Indonesia can help the country achieve a bevy of economic and development goals.</p><h4>Clean energy investments can drive big economic returns.</h4><p>Scaling up renewable energy will require significant upfront investments in new infrastructure, such as wind turbines, solar farms and battery storage systems. However, the anticipated returns make this spend worthwhile. Our research shows that renewable energy investments in Indonesia can deliver a projected return of $1.41 billion for every $1 billion invested.</p><p>The more Indonesia invests in renewables, the more it will generate demand — and thereby additional investment — for them. This can create new value chains for the installation and maintenance of renewable energy systems, spurring significant job creation and contributing to GDP gains.</p><p>In addition, upfront deployment costs would be offset in the long term by the much lower operation and maintenance costs of renewable facilities compared to fossil fuel plants. And a greater supply of renewables can generate additional economic returns by keeping workers healthier and more productive through cleaner air.</p><p>International partners under Indonesia's JETP will help provide early financial support for this infrastructure. But the total investment required to meet the country's targets far exceeds the $20 billion committed under the partnership, meaning the country will need to secure significant additional funding in the near-term from the government, private sector and international sources.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Workers clean and inspect solar panels on a rooftop.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/indonesia-solar-panel-maintenance.jpg?VersionId=v_1Plq5kGpgZuGK4I8EiZyE0EsbC8B4p&itok=QPqxNLH1\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Engineering students inspect rooftop solar panels in Bali, Indonesia.

According to our model, JETP investments are projected to lead to an additional 52.2 GW of on-grid renewable power and transmission infrastructure by 2030. This massive build-out would create 383,000 new jobs in the energy sector this decade, including roles such as solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the country could add almost 1 million total jobs in renewable energy construction and another 1.8 million in power generation by 2050. These would come from the scale up of not just wind and solar, but also hydropower, geothermal and nuclear power plants by 2034, as well as the introduction of green hydrogen in 2040.</p><p>While the net job gains are huge, this transition would also see 51,300 workers displaced from fossil fuel plants. Reskilling programs will be critical to help these workers transition into new, green job opportunities.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25340802/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Shifting away from fossil fuels can bolster energy security.</h4><p>Indonesia's domestic oil production has been in decline since 1997, increasing the country's reliance on imported oil to meet national energy demand. This is at odds with the country's goal of becoming more <a href=\"https://setkab.go.id/en/president-subianto-sets-strategic-plan-for-national-energy-independence-and-targeted-subsidies-in-high-level-meeting/\">energy independent</a>, as imported fossil fuels are vulnerable to global price shocks and supply disruptions. It's also expensive: <a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/business/indonesia-considers-doubling-us-crude-lpg-imports-to-offset-tariffs\">In 2024 alone</a>, Indonesia spent over US$36 billion on imported crude oil and natural gas.</p><p>Shifting to renewable energy would help lower this import dependence. In our JETP scenario, oil imports drop significantly as renewables scale up, saving 1.23 million barrels per day by 2050. In addition to limiting exposure to international market risks, this shift would free up public resources previously spent on oil imports and fossil fuel subsidies — funds that could be redirected to domestic energy infrastructure and other development priorities.</p><p>Moreover, increased reliance on clean electricity as opposed to fossil fuels could expedite the shift to electric transportation; a transition already well underway, with ambitions to <a href=\"https://itdp.org/2024/07/15/building-momentum-for-transport-electrification-in-indonesia/\">electrify 90%</a> of urban mass public transport by 2030 under the country's National E-Mobility Plan. This would further reduce the need for imported oil.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25324539/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Cleaner power means better health.</h4><p>Fossil fuel power plants emit harmful pollutants, including fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. These contribute to air pollution-related illnesses, such as asthma, pneumonia, lung cancer and tuberculosis, often with fatal results. Air pollution accounted for close to <a href=\"https://www.stateofglobalair.org/resources/countryprofiles\">10% of all deaths</a> in Indonesia in 2021, claiming over 222,000 lives. This places it among the five countries (alongside China, India, Pakistan and Nigeria) that together account for 60% of air pollution-related deaths globally. The problem is so severe in Jakarta that, in 2021, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2024/04/18/jakartas-air-pollution-is-the-indonesian-governments-human-rights-failure/\">residents sued</a> then-President Joko Widodo and other top officials over harmful air quality — and won.</p><p>Air pollution also takes a financial toll. Each case of acute respiratory illness in Indonesia carries an economic cost of roughly <a href=\"https://iesr.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Fuel-Emission-Health-Impacts-Cost-of-Illness-and-Energy-Transition-Scenario-in-Indonesia-%E2%80%8BBudi-Haryanto_RCCC-UI.pdf\">IDR 570,000</a> (about US$34), according to the national health insurance system. Between 2016 and 2021, this cost the country more than IDR 341 billion (about US$21 million) in total. Meanwhile, lost workdays from illnesses reduce overall productivity.</p><p>Renewable energy deployment would significantly reduce dangerous air pollution, lowering healthcare costs and increasing workforce productivity. Our model shows that meeting Indonesia's clean energy goals could save an estimated 62,000 lives per year, compared with business as usual.</p><h3>Turning Projections into Reality</h3><p>Taken together, these wide-ranging benefits show that decisive climate action is not just about avoiding risks — it is about seizing opportunities to grow sustainably and improve people's lives. But urgency is paramount. Indonesia and other countries need to move swiftly to scale up clean energy and energy efficiency and avoid locking in costly, polluting fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come.</p><p>The first step is raising ambition. Our analysis, based on interventions outlined in the 2023 CIPP, shows that Indonesia needs 63.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030 and 200 gigawatts by 2040 to meet its GDP targets via clean power. By contrast, the government's Electricity Supply Business Plan aims for only 18.6 gigawatts by 2030 and 75 by 2040. To turn its growth and climate ambitions into reality, the government must more than double its clean energy targets.</p><p>Investing early in energy efficiency can immediately address short-term energy demand and emissions while the country works toward longer-term decarbonization. Near-term measures can include building new energy distribution infrastructure, like transmission lines or microgrids connecting Indonesia's main islands. It can also include updating existing systems; for example, by switching to more efficient LED-based lighting systems and retrofitting windows to reduce air conditioning demand.</p><p>The biggest thrust, however, must come from rapidly expanding renewable energy and slashing reliance on fossil fuels. This will require mobilizing unprecedented clean energy investment from both the public and private sectors on top of JETP financing. It will also take significant policy change, such as cutting fossil fuel subsidies; implementing cross-sector efficiency standards to reduce energy intensity in manufacturing, transport and buildings; and upgrading grid infrastructure to integrate variable renewable energy sources.</p><h3>Lighting the Way Ahead</h3><p>While our study focuses on Indonesia, the implications are global. Many developing and emerging economies are at a similar crossroads, working to expand energy access and grow rapidly without exacerbating climate risks — and to ensure that the transition leaves no one behind.</p><p>This research offers compelling evidence that a clean energy transition is not an obstacle to growth, but a catalyst for it. By aligning ambitious growth targets with decisive clean energy strategies, countries can take the first step toward unlocking sustainable prosperity.</p>",

It fuels deforestation, drives biodiversity loss, and causes immense human suffering — stealing resources and revenue from communities and countries alike.</p><p>“This resolution is a breakthrough because it puts action against these crimes squarely on the conservation agenda. It signals growing resolve among IUCN members to confront environmental crime as a serious threat to people, nature and climate.</p><p>“The resolution provides a mandate for IUCN to incorporate efforts to tackle environmental crime within its workplan and encourages governments to address this issue at the national level.</p><p>“This is a milestone that lays the groundwork for stronger global cooperation on environmental crime, aligns IUCN’s efforts with other international frameworks and fora, and builds momentum heading into the UN Crime Congress in 2026.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>It may seem like political divides around climate change are only deepening. Yet the <a href=\"https://peoplesclimate.vote/document/Peoples_Climate_Vote_Report_2024.pdf\">world's largest climate survey</a> reveals a striking consensus: Eighty percent of people globally want their countries to take stronger climate action, and over half think about climate change daily or weekly. Far from being split, humanity is largely united on wanting to do more.</p><p>But how can we help move the needle?</p><p>First things first: It's true that governments and big businesses hold the most power to halt climate change. They have the ability to reshape global systems — like how we generate energy, produce food and design cities — that are at the root of the crisis. This is why political actions, like voting and joining climate campaigns, are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-impact-behavior-shifts\">among the most impactful</a> you can take.</p><p>But there's a lot we can do in our daily lives, too. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/effective-impact-behavioral-shifts\"><strong>WRI research</strong></a><strong> shows that shifting a few key behaviors can significantly reduce emissions and climate impacts. And the more people who act, the bigger the collective change. </strong>The trick is knowing where to prioritize our efforts.</p><h3>Ranking Climate-Friendly Choices</h3><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>The Inequality of Emissions</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Wealthy populations have the highest emissions per capita and therefore the most opportunity to shift toward climate-friendly behaviors. By contrast, some developing countries may need to <em>increase</em> emissions to provide basic necessities, like reliable electricity and nutritious food, to all people. Governments should seek clean, affordable pathways to meet these needs, while the biggest cuts must come from the highest emitters.</p></div><p>Narratives around personal climate action can be misleading. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/6/pgaf191/8159053?login=false\">Research shows</a> that people often overestimate the climate benefits of easier behavioral changes, like recycling, while discounting more impactful ones, like cutting back on air travel and eating less meat.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/effective-impact-behavioral-shifts\">recent WRI paper</a> analyzed 19 climate-friendly behaviors to reveal which ones reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions the most. Even adopting just a few of these actions — particularly those with the biggest emissions-reduction potential — can make a difference. Understanding which actions pack the biggest punch also helps us know where to aim our collective action efforts for the maximum impact.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25378153/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The \"right\" decisions will look different for everyone depending on what's accessible to them. Living car-free is the most impactful behavior by far in terms of reducing emissions. But if that's unattainable, switching from a gas-powered car to an electric vehicle, or shifting as many trips as possible to walking, biking or public transit, also cuts emissions.</p><p>Similarly, going vegan is nearly 3 times more impactful for the climate than decreasing food waste, 9 times more impactful than decreasing consumption of packaged or processed goods, and 30 times more impactful than composting. Full veganism may be a stretch for most people, but going vegetarian or even reducing meat consumption also makes a difference.</p><p>Impact also depends on each person's starting point: Those who drive and fly extensively and eat meat-heavy diets have far greater emissions-reduction potential than those whose emissions are already minimal.</p><h3>The Catch: It Will Take All of Us</h3><p>Each of these actions can help reduce your own carbon emissions. But altering the trajectory of climate change hinges on not one, not a few, but billions of people making such shifts.</p><p>The challenge is that most high-impact behaviors — like living car-free or installing renewable energy at home — aren't equally accessible to everyone. Achieving truly widespread change will require unprecedented support from governments, companies, financial institutions and industry leaders to make these behavioral shifts easy, routine and accessible for most people.</p><p>Living car-free requires access to reliable public transit, safe bike infrastructure, and subsidies to help people to purchase bikes or e-bikes. Decreasing air travel often depends on companies offering remote options and governments investing in lower-carbon travel, like high-speed rail. Most people would need subsidies to afford the cost of installing rooftop solar panels or paying for energy-efficient home renovations.</p><p>Indeed, our <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/effective-impact-behavioral-shifts\">research</a> found that interventions intended to shift people toward climate-friendly behaviors — such as asking people to commit to using public transit, or comparing their energy use to their neighbors — achieve <em>only 10%</em> of their potential emissions impact without systemic support. The remaining 90% is reliant on broader changes that make individual actions attainable.</p><h3>So, What Should We Do to Make the Biggest Difference?</h3><p>This is the central challenge behind the numbers: Behavioral shifts aren't just personal, they are also shaped and enabled by the world around us. We need both individual and systems change to solve the problem.</p><p>If you want to make a difference, there are ways to contribute at both levels:</p><p>Push for what you can't control alone. Vote for leaders who support climate-smart investments; demand action from those already in power; sign petitions; and join collective campaigns that drive change at scale. For example, look for leaders who champion:</p><ul><li>Investing in public transit that is clean, reliable and accessible.</li><li>Subsidizing electric and hybrid vehicles and building a nationwide EV charging network.</li><li>Electrifying buildings and offering incentives for heat pumps, solar panels and energy-efficient retrofits.</li><li>Expanding protected bike lanes, bike share networks and walkable city planning.</li><li>Making plant-based food affordable, available and appealing.</li></ul><p>When it comes to daily choices, make the most impactful actions you can based on what's accessible and affordable for your circumstances. You might focus on what is most appealing in terms of health (to get more exercise, you could prioritize biking to work); financial savings (installing a heat pump can cut energy costs in the long term), or ease (if you do have to fly, prioritize economy class and/or direct flights).</p><p>With each vote, petition and personal change we make, we can become part of the global solution, signaling to leaders what the surveys already show: That we care about our collective climate future, and change cannot wait.</p>",

Because the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean School Bus Program limits eligibility to certain types of applicants, nonprofit school transportation providers like the Cherokee Boys Club could not apply directly. Instead, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians had to set up complex arrangements to channel grant funds, which added administrative difficulty to the process. In addition, in the early stages of the transition, the Cherokee Boys Club was surprised by the high infrastructure costs for necessary upgrades for EV charger installation. While they were able to work with their partner Duke Energy to cover these expenses, other school districts may need to budget for these upgrades. Districts may also be able to limit power demands by adopting practices such as <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/all-about-managed-charging-and-vehicle-everything-or-v2x\">managed charging</a>.</p><h3>Sipayik Elementary School (Maine Indian Education)</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.maineindianeducation.org/\">Maine Indian Education</a>, through <a href=\"https://www.maineindianeducation.org/article/1579420\">EPA's 2023 Clean School Bus Program rebate</a>, electrified the <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/how-rural-tribal-school-electrified-their-school-bus-fleet\">three buses serving Sipayik Elementary</a>, which educates Passamaquoddy Tribe’s youth who live on the <a href=\"https://wabanaki.com/\">Pleasant Point (Sipayik) Reservation</a> (sharing geography with Maine).</p><article class=\"align-right media media--type-embed media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25300703/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Sipayik Elementary’s transition was motivated by Maine Indian Education’s desire to address high respiratory disease rates among the Passamaquoddy community and reduce emissions and operational costs. The outcomes exceeded expectations with an 80% reduction in Maine Indian Education’s energy costs, 60% reduced maintenance expenses and approximately 25 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per bus avoided each year. The school district intends to reinvest its cost savings into school programs.</p><p>One of the project's most striking aspects lies in the integration of Passamaquoddy cultural values throughout the electrification effort. Instead of the vehicles’ safety feature playing default warning sounds to compensate for the buses’ silent operation, the buses play a traditional Passamaquoddy travel song recorded by tribal elder Wayne Newell during slow speeds. This fusion of language preservation with transportation modernization marks the beginning of Maine Indian Education’s broader vision to integrate cultural education with a curriculum that includes lessons on sustainability, science, math, language, and social sciences.</p><p class=\"secondary\"><em>Listen to a traditional Passamaquoddy travel song performed by tribal elder Wayne Newell:</em></p><p><audio controls=\"controls\" title=\"Recording of the Travel Elder Song played through the electric school bus speakers\">\n    <source src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/2025-10/travel-song.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n    </audio></p><h3>Shawnee Public Schools</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.countywidenews.com/news/sps-receives-142-million-epa-grant-electric-buses\">Shawnee Public Schools</a>, which serves students from the <a href=\"https://www.potawatomi.org/\">Citizen Potawatomi Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.choctawnation.com/about/\">Choctaw Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.muscogeenation.com/\">Muscogee (Creek) Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astribe.com/about-us\">Absentee Shawnee Tribe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sacandfoxnation-nsn.gov/about/\">Sac & Fox Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kickapootribeofoklahoma.com/\">Kickapoo Tribe</a>, <a href=\"https://iowanation.org/about-us/\">Iowa Nation (Baxoje)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sno-nsn.gov/\">Seminole Tribe</a>, pursued electrification for financial savings and air quality benefits.

Switching from diesel to electric was viewed as an essential step toward reducing pollution and protecting student health. The benefits soon extended beyond cleaner air. The buses helped spark community-wide interest in renewable energy and electric vehicles, aligning with Red Lake Nation’s broader goals of energy sovereignty and self-determination.</p><p>Getting the project underway was the most significant hurdle for the school. Navigating an unfamiliar industry, identifying manufacturers and building the right partnerships required persistence and teamwork. Those early challenges are now giving way to momentum, as the success of the pilot has encouraged other tribal schools and leaders to pursue electric buses of their own. For these communities, electric school buses are more than just a cleaner mode of transportation, they represent a pathway to healthier commutes, stronger communities and greater control over their energy future.</p><p>In addition to Endazhi-Nitaawiging's electric school bus deployment, Red Lake Schools, a public school operating within Red Lake Nation, has electrified their school bus fleet through a Clean School Bus Program award.</p><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><p>Tribal schools that have begun the transition from diesel to electric school buses emphasize that success depends on careful preparation, strong relationships and community engagement. Their experiences point to common strategies that can help other districts and those working alongside them to navigate the opportunities and challenges of electrification:</p><ul><li><strong>Start early</strong>. Allow ample time for community input, infrastructure assessments and grant applications.</li><li><strong>Build strong partnerships</strong>. Work closely with utility companies, vendors and community stakeholders, and prioritize collaboration with established manufacturers to ensure security and expertise throughout the deployment process.</li><li><strong>Plan thoroughly.</strong> Develop clear route deployment strategies, reliable maintenance services and comprehensive training programs for staff.</li><li><strong>Document and engage.</strong> Collect evidence of community support and assess health impacts to strengthen the case for electric buses and keep transitions people-centered.</li><li><strong>Honor culture and inspire youth</strong>. Incorporate cultural practices, such as blessing ceremonies with community elders, and create opportunities for students to serve as advocates and leaders in clean transportation.</li><li><strong>Know the market.</strong> Become familiar with the range of electric bus manufactures early on to avoid delays and confusion during deployment.</li></ul><p>Tribal nations are proving that the shift to electric school buses is far more than a technological change. By embracing cleaner transportation, they are strengthening community health, reinforcing cultural values and building partnerships that will carry forward for generations. Although tribal schools currently represent only a small share of electric bus adoption nationwide, the experiences of Cherokee Central Schools, Sipayik Elementary School, Shawnee Public Schools and Endazhi-Netaawiging demonstrates what is possible when communities lead with vision and determination.</p><p>Each new electric bus on the road reflects progress and a step toward self-determination. For some tribal nations, including the ones mentioned here, that means embracing electrification, using their current fleet or choosing a different technology. What matters most is that the decision rests with tribal governments to ensure that the future of Native students and their communities is shaped by their own sovereignty and sustainable vision for generations to come.</p><p><em>To find out more about transitioning electric school buses within tribal nations and Native communities, check out these resources:</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/whos-driving-bus-culturally-and-legally-informed-approach-electrifying-student\">Who's Driving This Bus?

      "description": "<p>Climate change is accelerating, threatening lives, livelihoods and economies across the world. In response, countries are stepping up efforts to manage climate risks and shift away from carbon-intensive industries. But alongside the technical and financial challenges posed by this climate transition lies a political and social reality: Without proper attention to the distribution of the costs and benefits of the transition, there may be heightened inequality and political resistance that undermines the transition itself.</p><p>A just transition approach directly addresses this risk and builds a fair, stronger and more resilient pathway to prosperity. By anticipating and managing the social and economic impacts of decarbonization, just transition policies help ensure that the costs of change are not borne disproportionately by vulnerable communities.</p><p>Done well, just transition policies can unlock broad participation in the new green economy, support social protection and reskilling, strengthen local resilience to climate shocks, and mobilize non-state actors behind national climate goals. Neglecting social and equity considerations, by contrast, risks slowing progress, provoking contestation and leaving people more vulnerable to both transition risks and climate impacts.</p><p>To deepen understanding of what enables effective just transitions, WRI supported a series of national dialogues across eight countries: Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/what-just-transition-and-why-it-crucial-colombia\">Colombia</a>, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. Five common themes emerged as critical levers: <em><strong>participation and inclusion; assessing and managing the social and economic impacts of the transition; aligning policies across sectors; strengthening governance and institutional capacity; </strong></em><strong>and</strong><em><strong> mobilizing finance at scale</strong></em>. </p><p>Illustrative case studies from each country shows the evidence is clear: Where these enabling factors are supported, just transition efforts can gain traction and accelerate; where they are neglected, transitions risk stalling. Drawing lessons from country experiences, these five levers can advance equitable, resilient and politically viable climate action.</p><h3>1) Participation and Inclusion</h3><p>Inclusive and participatory stakeholder engagement is not just a matter of fairness — it is central to building the legitimacy, acceptance and momentum needed for a successful transition. Ensuring meaningful representation of impacted stakeholders, especially women, youth, informal sector workers and Indigenous communities, allows policies to respond to lived realities while broadening the constituency for climate action. Bottom-up approaches that localize problems and solutions build trust, reduce conflict and ensure that communities most affected by the transition can shape its direction.</p><p>Kenya offers valuable lessons in this regard. Localized engagement — whether through research co-designed with communities, dialogues held in local languages or forums that amplify the voices of women and marginalized groups — has proven effective in grounding policy responses in lived experience. Projects such as <a href=\"https://www.hoperaisersinitiative.com/future-yetu#:~:text=He%20is%20a%20mentor%20focusing,and%20sports%20in%20his%20community.&text=Through%20a%20mobile%20Matatu%20exhibition,around%20the%20streets%20of%20Korogocho.\">Future Yetu</a> in Nairobi’s informal settlements used storytelling to link climate impacts with community-driven solutions. <a href=\"https://pacida.org/climate-change/\">Pastoralist Community Initiative and Development Assistance </a> in northern Kenya mobilized pastoralist communities through culturally appropriate methods, ensuring climate plans reflected local priorities. Women’s climate forums in Kwale County demonstrated how targeted spaces can surface practical solutions — from drought-resistant crops to sustainable energy — that might otherwise be overlooked. The lesson is clear: Inclusive engagement strengthens both the quality and relevance of policy outcomes.</p><p>Brazil has experimented with scaling inclusivity to the national level. Through the <a href=\"https://brasilparticipativo.presidencia.gov.br/processes/planoclima/f/145/\">Brasil Participativo</a> platform, citizens are invited to propose, debate and vote on ideas feeding into the country’s updated national climate plan. The process has already drawn tens of thousands of participants and generated over a thousand proposals. While challenges remain — particularly in reaching communities without internet or reliable energy access — the initiative shows how participatory democracy can be harnessed to embed just transition principles across national strategies.</p><p>Taken together, these experiences highlight that participation and inclusion are not only about protecting vulnerable groups; they are also about broadening the social base for climate action. When communities see their priorities reflected in policies, they are more likely to support and defend them. In this way, inclusion strengthens both the equity and the political durability of the transition, ensuring it can move forward with legitimacy and momentum.</p><h3>2) Assessing and Managing the Social and Economic Impacts of the Transition</h3><p>A just transition depends on understanding who wins, who loses and how benefits and risks are distributed as economies shift. Without this knowledge, climate policies can create unintended consequences that undermine livelihoods, deepen inequality and provoke resistance. By contrast, careful analysis of social and economic impacts allows governments to anticipate risks, design targeted protections and unlock the full growth potential of a green economy.</p><p>India’s experience in the brick-making industry illustrates both the risks and opportunities. Pollution-reduction policies are driving a shift away from traditional kilns, which employ large numbers of informal workers with limited safety nets. Introducing cleaner technologies such as <a href=\"https://www.ccacoalition.org/sites/default/files/resources/Bricks-SEA.pdf\">fixed chimney bull’s trench kilns</a> can reduce emissions and health impacts, but their success depends on investment in <a href=\"https://wri-india.org/perspectives/breaking-mold-transforming-bihars-brick-kilns\">training</a> for both workers and owners. This example demonstrates how climate policies must be accompanied by strategies to reskill vulnerable workers and adapt technologies to local contexts. Otherwise, environmental gains risk being offset by social dislocation.</p><p>Ethiopia demonstrates the power of investing in modelling and data to guide decision-making. By building technical capacity in systems dynamics modelling, the government has projected the potential costs and benefits of different transition pathways. These analyses revealed opportunities for growth in renewables, transport, forestry and climate-smart agriculture, while identifying risks in traditional agriculture and industry. The results directly informed the country’s <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/ETHIOPIA_%20LONG%20TERM%20LOW%20EMISSION%20AND%20CLIMATE%20RESILIENT%20DEVELOPMENT%20STRATEGY.pdf\">long-term low emissions development strategy</a> and nationally determined contribution (NDC), embedding social and economic considerations into national development planning. This kind of rigorous modelling can help governments manage risks proactively while aligning climate strategies with growth and jobs.</p><p>Across these cases, it is evident that deliberately seeking to understand the social and economic impacts of climate policies is a prerequisite for socially responsive policies. Careful data gathering, robust analysis and continuous monitoring enable policymakers to design measures that cushion vulnerable groups, seize new opportunities and ensure that climate action contributes to shared prosperity.</p><h3>3) Aligning Policies Across Sectors</h3><p>Managing climate transitions is not the responsibility of any single ministry. The impacts of decarbonization span energy, industry, labor, agriculture, transport and social protection, therefore, achieving a just transition requires coordinated action across government. Ministries responsible for economic planning, labor markets, industrial policy and social protection must work hand in hand with sectoral line ministries. A robust national framework that explicitly integrates climate and just transition principles can provide the foundation for this alignment — ensuring that economic, social and environmental goals reinforce rather than contradict each other.</p><p>Colombia shows how integrated frameworks can create coherence. Its long-term climate strategy (<a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/COL_LTS_Nov2021.pdf\">E2050</a>) and <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/NDC%203.0%20Declarativa%20Colombia%20Transformaciones%20para%20la%20Vida%20V.25.09.2025%20Gob.%20Nacional.pdf\">NDC</a> embed just transition principles at the national level, while sectoral roadmaps provide more detailed guidance. The Ministry of Mines and Energy’s Just Energy Transition Roadmap outlines plans to decarbonize the energy sector, expand renewables and diversify local economies in coal-dependent regions. Complementing this, the Ministry of Labor is developing a phased National Just Transition Workforce Strategy to drive green job creation and reskilling across sectors, starting with energy and moving progressively into agriculture, transport, commerce and construction. This alignment across ministries ensures that decarbonization efforts are matched with labor market strategies and regional development planning, thereby reducing the risks of dislocation and unlocking new growth opportunities.</p><p>Yet, Colombia’s experience also highlights the need to bridge public–private divides. Business leaders voiced frustration about being excluded from international climate negotiations despite being essential to implementation. The government responded by initiating structured dialogues with private actors after the 2024 UN climate change summit (COP29), a first step toward more effective coordination. The lesson from this experience is clear: Alignment is needed not only across ministries, but also between governments, businesses, workers and civil society. Without the involvement of these different actors, implementation will falter.</p><p>Beyond coordinating across ministries and sectors, Brazil demonstrates the benefits of aligning social and economic goals with climate objectives. By emphasizing high-quality job creation, reducing inequality and prioritizing support for youth, women and marginalized communities, the new Brazil ecological transformation plan ensures that decarbonization delivers inclusive development. Anchoring social protection, health care and welfare in transition planning builds security for workers and communities, while skills development programs prepare people to seize new opportunities. This comprehensive approach demonstrates that when social policy and climate policy are integrated, the transition becomes a driver of equity as well as growth.</p><p>These cases show that alignment is not an administrative exercise, but a political and economic imperative. Coordinated responses across ministries and with social partners ensure that climate action supports jobs, growth and equity. When policy coherence is achieved, climate transitions can generate broad socio-economic benefits and build durable support for ambitious climate action.</p><h3>4) Strengthening Governance and Institutional Capacity</h3><p>Policy alignment alone is insufficient without the governance mechanisms and institutional capacity to make it real. Managing a climate transition requires not only clear strategies, but also the ability to coordinate across government, engage stakeholders and implement sectoral programs at scale. Weak institutions or fragmented responsibilities can derail even the most carefully designed plans. By contrast, strong governance systems that bring together diverse actors — across ministries, levels of government, business, labor and civil society — create the foundation for effective implementation and durable political support.</p><p>South Africa provides a valuable example of how governance structures can be built to underpin a just transition. At the advisory level, the <a href=\"https://www.climatecommission.org.za/\">Presidential Climate Commission (PCC)</a> has played a critical role in building consensus across stakeholders. Chaired by the country’s president and drawing in government, labor, business, civil society, youth and traditional leadership, the PCC has provided a forum for negotiating trade-offs, shaping the national <a href=\"https://pccommissionflo.imgix.net/uploads/images/22_PAPER_Framework-for-a-Just-Transition_revised_242.pdf\">Just Transition Framework</a> and monitoring progress. Its inclusive composition has given legitimacy to the transition agenda and helped ensure that diverse perspectives are represented.</p><p>Yet the PCC is only part of the governance solution. Implementation capacity has been bolstered by the establishment of the <a href=\"https://justenergytransition.co.za/about\">Just Energy Transition Project Management Unit (JET PMU)</a>, which provides technical and coordination support to government. Working through an inter-ministerial committee, the JET PMU has ensured political oversight at the highest level while driving alignment across departments. Importantly, it has supported line ministries — such as energy, transport and higher education — to take the lead on delivering specific components of the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan. Subnational governments (provinces and municipalities) have also been engaged as partners in the energy transition. This dual structure, combining participatory advisory mechanisms with an operational coordination unit, has enabled South Africa to move from planning to implementation.</p><p>The lesson is clear: Governance capacity is as important as technical and financial resources. Countries need institutions that can integrate stakeholder voices, build consensus and monitor progress, while also ensuring that sectoral ministries, subnational governments and social partners have the capacity to deliver on their respective roles. Where governance is strong, transitions gain coherence, legitimacy and momentum; where it is weak, policies risk stalling or fragmenting.</p><h3>5) Mobilizing Finance at Scale</h3><p>A just transition cannot be delivered without finance — not only for decarbonization technologies, but also for the social and economic measures that make the transition fair and durable. Investment is needed to reskill workers, diversify regional economies, strengthen social protection and build resilience in vulnerable communities. Mobilizing finance at scale from domestic and international, public and private sources is therefore essential. Importantly, financing strategies must be designed to ensure the equitable distribution of benefits, reaching not only large infrastructure projects but also small enterprises, informal workers and community-led initiatives that are critical to inclusive transitions.</p><p>Indonesia’s experience shows both the opportunities and the gaps in aligning finance with just transition objectives. The country’s Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs launched the Global Blended Finance Alliance (GBFA) in 2022 in an effort to mobilize and scale blended finance instruments to support climate and development goals. By building institutional capacity and encouraging <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/indonesia/press-releases/sdg-linked-global-blended-finance-alliance-gbfa-marks-milestone-undp-tony-blair-institute-join-platform\">multi-stakeholder partnerships</a>, the GBFA could play an important role in financing transition efforts. However, difficulties in channeling global funds such as the Just Energy Transition Partnership to industry players highlight a persistent challenge: resources often flow to governments and state-owned enterprises, while private sector actors — including local firms that create jobs and drive regional diversification — remain constrained. As such, financing frameworks must deliberately include mechanisms to support businesses, workers and regions most exposed to transition risks, ensuring that financial flows extend beyond the energy sector into wider social and economic priorities.</p><p>Rwanda offers another perspective on how finance can advance just transition outcomes. With support from the World Bank, the <a href=\"https://www.brd.rw/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRD_Annual_Report_2024.pdf\">Renewable Energy Fund</a> expanded electricity access to more than 2 million people, created over 4,000 jobs, and catalyzed private investment in Rwanda. These are important social and economic co-benefits. Yet the government has identified a significant funding gap to reach universal electrification and faces barriers including high local lending rates and limited specialized financing mechanisms. The lesson here is that financing strategies must be intentionally structured to advance equity and resilience: By building local financial sector capacity, tailoring instruments such as green bonds or impact bonds to national contexts and prioritizing affordability for vulnerable households, finance can become a lever not just for energy access, but for inclusive economic participation and regional development.</p><p>These examples demonstrate that mobilizing finance at scale is not only about raising capital for low-carbon infrastructure but also about designing financial mechanisms that embed just transition priorities. By explicitly funding skills, diversification, social support and resilience, financing strategies can unlock the socio-economic benefits of the transition and build durable public and political support for climate action.</p><h3>Sharing Lessons Learned Across Countries to Support Just Transitions</h3><p>Experiences from Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa show that while the pathways differ, the underlying lesson is the same: Just transitions work best when they combine ambition with inclusion. Across these contexts, five levers — participation and inclusion, understanding social and economic impacts, policy alignment, governance capacity, and financing strategies — have emerged as critical to ensuring that climate action delivers not only emissions reductions but also jobs, resilience and equity.</p><p>Neglecting these dimensions risks social dislocation, political resistance and stalled progress. Supporting them, by contrast, builds legitimacy, expands the social base for climate action, and unlocks economic opportunities that make the transition both fair and feasible. Importantly, the equity dimension is not limited to decarbonization: climate impacts themselves fall hardest on vulnerable communities, making resilience and social protection core components of a fair transition.</p><p>The country experiences reviewed here highlight the importance of cross-country learning. While no single model can be transplanted wholesale, the common challenges and solutions underscore the value of sharing knowledge and best practices across contexts. Building platforms for this exchange — particularly among countries in the Global South — will be critical to accelerating progress.</p><p>Just transitions are not only a moral imperative, but a practical necessity for effective and politically viable climate action. By embedding social and economic priorities into transition strategies, countries can transform the risks of climate change into an opportunity for inclusive growth and resilient development.</p>",
