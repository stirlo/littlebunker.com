      "description": "<p><em>Eight inaugural countries already committed to challenge</em></p><p><strong>Nice, France (June 9, 2025) </strong>- Today at the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC), Brazil and France launched a landmark international initiative to dramatically scale up ocean-focused climate action. The Blue NDC Challenge calls on all countries to place the ocean at the heart of their climate plans (Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) ahead of COP30 which Brazil will host in November.</p><p>Alongside Brazil and France, an inaugural group of eight countries including Australia, Fiji, Kenya, Mexico, Palau, and the Republic of Seychelles, has already joined the initiative, committing to include the ocean in their updated climate plans under the Paris Agreement. These plans represent the centerpiece of each country’s efforts to reduce emissions and limit warming to 1.5°C and build resilience, and represent the highest level of political will under the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p>Launched today, and building on the momentum this year brings as countries prepare to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, the Blue NDC Challenge underscores the urgent need to recognise the ocean’s central role in addressing the climate crisis as a key ally. The initiative is supported by Ocean Conservancy, the Ocean & Climate Platform, and the World Resources Institute through the Ocean Resilience and Climate Alliance (ORCA) and has been endorsed by WWF-Brazil.</p><p>In addition to its forests, Brazil is also an oceanic nation, with 40% of its territory located at sea and hosting marine ecosystems of global significance — including the only coral reefs in the South Atlantic and the world's largest contiguous mangrove belt along the Amazon coast. These ecosystems play a vital role in both climate adaptation and mitigation, serving as natural buffers against extreme weather events and contributing to carbon storage.</p><p><em>“For Brazil, the Blue NDC Challenge represents a key opportunity to strengthen ocean-related climate action and to emphasize the essential role of ocean-based solutions in achieving emission reduction targets. Through this initiative Brazil seeks to advance international cooperation on ocean climate action in the lead-up to COP30, and to underscore the need for all countries to fully integrate the ocean into their national climate strategies,” said <strong>Marina Silva, Brazil Minister for the Environment and Climate Change.</strong></em></p><p><em>“In its recently submitted NDC, Brazil has explicitly included, for the first time, ocean-based climate actions, recognizing the ocean’s critical role in climate regulation. These include the implementation of national Marine Spatial Planning, the enhancement of coastal zone management, and the establishment of programs for the conservation and restoration of mangroves and coral reefs,” she noted.</em></p><p>Governments joining the Blue NDCs Challenge commit to stepping up efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience through ocean-based solutions, while also delivering benefits for both nature and people. Depending on their national context, participating countries may include actions such as:</p><ul><li>Sustainably managing, conserving, and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems - including through marine spatial planning, integrated coastal zone management, and climate-smart marine protected areas;</li><li>Phasing out offshore oil and gas production and expanding clean ocean energy, such as offshore wind, wave, and tidal power - supported by innovation and technology transfer;</li><li>Cutting emissions and strengthening resilience in maritime sectors, including shipping and seafood value chains;</li><li>Supporting sustainable, climate-resilient fisheries and aquaculture to ensure long-term ocean health and food security.</li></ul><p>Governments that join the Challenge will receive support from a wide range of partners and initiatives, including the Ocean Breakthroughs led by the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, the UN High-Level Climate Champions, and the NDC Partnership hosted by World Resources Institute. Together, they aim to boost investment and action in ocean-based solutions to help achieve a net-zero, resilient, and nature-positive future by 2050.</p><p><em>“Ultimately, industrial marine sectors and natural ecosystems are underused tools in addressing climate change and other development needs. As world leaders gather in Nice and prepare for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Belém (COP30), they can take inspiration from the Seychelles in championing ocean-based climate action,” said <strong>Wavel Ramkalawan is President of the Republic of Seychelles.</strong></em></p><p><em>“We are pleased to join the Blue NDC Challenge and work alongside COP30 host, Brazil, as well as France, Fiji, the Republic of Seychelles, Mexico, Palau to highlight the vital role of the ocean in global efforts on climate change,” said <strong>Senator Murray Watt, Australian Minister for the Environment.</strong></em></p><p><em>“This is an important initiative, and we commend France and Pacific countries in their longstanding leadership on this issue. There are significant opportunities in sustainably managing, conserving and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems, among other blue solutions. We acknowledge the links being drawn between the Paris Agreement and the ocean program this year, as we approach a decade of the Paris Agreement.”</em></p><p>Quotes from supporting and endorsing NGOs:</p><p><em>“The ocean already plays a vital role in stabilizing our climate–but it has vast untapped potential to be an even greater part of the solution. From harnessing clean energy like offshore wind to restoring marine ecosystems that store vast amounts of carbon, there are many ways that countries can use ocean-climate solutions to deliver on the Paris Agreement,” said <strong>Janis Searles Jones, CEO of Ocean Conservancy</strong>. \"I thank Brazil for their leadership on the road to COP30. Thank you for launching this Challenge to solidify ocean-based climate solutions as a key part of national climate plans--and to get the resources and assistance needed to make them a reality.\"</em></p><p><em>“Ocean-based climate solutions can deliver up to 35% of the emissions reductions needed to keep 1.5°C within reach. But we are running out of time to maximise the ocean’s potential. That’s why countries must place the ocean at the heart of their climate strategies. We applaud Brazil’s leadership in launching the Blue NDC Challenge, this is a vital step to mobilize ambition, support, and coordination to fully integrate the ocean into national climate plans,” said <strong>Tom Pickerell, Global Director of the Ocean Program at World Resources Institute and Head of the Secretariat for the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.</strong></em></p><p><em>“The Paris Agreement was the beginning – a promise that ambition would grow over time. Ten years on, the time for promises is now over. The Blue NDC Challenge is how we turn Paris ambition into Belém action, by fully leveraging ocean-based climate action,” said <strong>Loreley Picourt, Executive Director, Ocean & Climate Platform.</strong></em></p><p><em>“As the host of the next climate conference, Brazil has a unique opportunity to lead by example with an ambitious, science- and nature-based agenda that amplifies the voices of vulnerable communities. Including the ocean in national commitments — and ensuring their implementation — is essential to addressing the climate crisis with the urgency it demands. We see the Blue NDC challenge, and Brazil’s leadership, as crucial steps toward more effective, integrated, and resilient climate solutions,” said <strong>Marina Corrêa, Oceans Lead at WWF-Brazil.</strong></em><br /> </p>",

      "description": "<p>By midday in Mathare, a densely populated informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, the sun beats down on the tight rows of wooden stalls and corrugated metal rooftops. At an elevation of 5,889 feet (1,795 meters), Nairobi has long been known for its temperate climate. But in recent years, heat has become an unavoidable issue — especially in informal settlements, which can be up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) hotter than the rest of the city.</p><p>In Mathare, local street vendors selling fresh produce and fish once relied on a steady stream of customers throughout the day. Now, the heat often spoils their goods before they can be sold.</p><p>“If they don’t have a quick market, they’re seeing a lot of losses by the end of the day,” said Michelle Koyaro, program associate at Slum Dwellers International (SDI) Kenya. Some vendors have started selling in the cooler evenings, but fewer customers come out during those hours. Instead, after long days under the hot sun, sellers head home with headaches and lean earnings.</p><p><strong>In cities around the world, extreme heat is no longer a short-term event or seasonal disruption. It’s a growing daily pressure that is reshaping how people live, move and work — and it’s getting worse.</strong></p><p>Heat is a well-documented threat to health. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 500,000 people <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health\">die</a> from heat-related causes each year — a number expected to rise by 50% by 2050. But the crisis goes beyond public health: Heat is also undermining economies, infrastructure, social systems and the well-being of residents in cities around the world.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"958\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"767\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"587\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"462\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"277\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Sellers sell fresh produce on the side of the street in Mathare, an informal community in Nairobi, Kenya.\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/51962765079-2af57e3564-k.jpg?VersionId=7w2WQKrfxsnHf7xWRoQqp25vXJHaRuJY&itok=gtPs9Z0Z\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Sellers line a street in Mathare to sell their fresh produce.

Heat is not an isolated issue. To adapt effectively, cities must understand how rising temperatures are transforming and threatening multiple aspects of urban life — and recognize they’re not alone in the challenges they face.</p><p>Already, more than 350 cities worldwide are grappling with summertime temperatures <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cities-where-fight-green-recovery-will-be-won-or-lost\">above 35 degrees C</a> (95 degrees F), and that number will only grow as the climate warms. Cities have enormous potential to learn from one another — what has worked, and what hasn’t — as they adapt to heat and work to mitigate its worst impacts.</p><p>Here, through the lens of four essential sectors — health, transportation, jobs and economic productivity — we examine the cascading impacts of heat in cities and offer tangible, scalable solutions that cities can use to develop effective, far-reaching strategies.</p><h3>Health: Prioritizing Well-Being as Cities Heat Up</h3><p>Anyone who’s spent time outside on an extremely hot day knows how draining it can be — headaches, dehydration, fatigue and trouble concentrating. But what happens when this exposure is constant — not just for a few hours, but every day? The effects on the body can shift from uncomfortable to dangerous.</p><p>Prolonged heat exposure can strain vital organs like the heart and kidneys, disrupt sleep, cause mental stress and worsen chronic conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. Researchers project that long-term heat exposure will become the norm, with parts of Africa, South Asia and Latin America <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/future-extreme-heat-cities-data\">among the most affected</a>.</p><p>Extreme heat poses a particular challenge to low-income urban residents, who may live in poorly ventilated homes or work outdoors. Over the course of a day, prolonged heat exposure compounds the risks they face. Children, <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/07/extreme-heat-makes-pregnancy-more-dangerous/\">pregnant people</a> and older adults are especially vulnerable.</p><p>Addressing these risks requires a multifaceted approach that works in both the short and long term. In the immediate term, cities need to invest in interventions that lower exposure in the places where people spend time or provide options for escaping the heat. Early warning systems, like those in <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/2022/06/23/a-health-based-heatwave-categorizing-and-naming-system/\">Athens</a> and <a href=\"https://ghhin.org/resources/early-warning-system-for-extreme-temperatures-in-argentina/\">Buenos Aires</a>, alert residents to upcoming heat waves and offer practical guidance for staying safe.</p><p>Public cooling centers — community spaces with air conditioning or fans and drinking water — can reduce immediate health threats by providing temporary refuge. In Jodhpur, India, which is coping with intensifying heat waves, a net-zero cooling shelter equipped with misting fans, solar panels and a wind tower that passively circulates cooler air provides relief to those who must be outside. Inside, temperatures are up to <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/vijay-limaye/jodhpur-india-unveils-its-first-net-zero-cooling-station\">12 degrees</a> C (21.6 degrees F) cooler than just outside the door.</p><p>In Phoenix, Arizona — <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/phoenix-americas-hottest-city-is-having-a-surge-of-deaths/\">the hottest city in the United States</a> — a 24/7 cooling center <a href=\"https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2025-03-29/phoenix-will-move-24-7-cooling-centers-including-at-burton-barr-library-to-single-new-location\">drew thousands of visitors</a> during 2024’s hottest period, including unhoused residents, <a href=\"https://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5934\">who are far more likely to die from heat-related causes</a>. This site, along with the city’s other heat preparedness efforts — such as connecting people to resources for air conditioning repairs — contributed to <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/07/new-247-cooling-center-opens-downtown-phoenix/\">a 20% drop</a> in heat-related emergency calls. Even brief breaks in cool spaces have been shown to reduce physiological and cardiovascular strain.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Women walk across a sunny street in Athens.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/athens-greece_0.jpg?VersionId=XZjjHUqK.iefE2vKId4MiFMn2NpyZ4pJ&itok=7Ma0iJS8\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>People walk through the streets of Athens, Greece, during the 2022 extreme heat wave.

Cities must also invest in long-term strategies to expand heat-resistant housing and reduce urban heat in places where residents spend time at school, at work or in transit. Increasing urban greenery and tree cover can lower peak temperatures <a href=\"https://development.asia/explainer/how-cities-can-combat-extreme-heat-using-nature-based-solutions\">by up to 5 degrees C</a> (9 degrees F).</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">Health Impact Solution: Understanding and Acting on the Local Relationship Between Place, Population and Heat Health</p><p class=\"secondary\">Emergency measures aren’t enough. Building long-term urban resilience means identifying and addressing who is most vulnerable. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/heat-and-health-brazilian-cities\" target=\"_blank\">WRI is partnering with </a>the Salud Urbana en América Latina <u>(</u>SALURBAL<u>)</u> initiative — a collaboration of research institutions across Latin America and the United States, coordinated by Drexel University — to study how social and environmental factors influence heat-related health outcomes in two Brazilian cities: Campinas and Belo Horizonte. The goal is to help cities design targeted, equitable interventions, such as expanding nature-based solutions and prioritizing health care.</p></div><p>In informal settlements, where rooftops are often made from heat-trapping materials like corrugated steel, participatory upgrading programs — which directly involve residents in improving their own living conditions — can substantially boost resilience and health. For example, research shows that adding cool roof solutions, such as vegetation or reflective surfaces, to informal homes can <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032122001083#:~:text=We%20show%20that%20occupants%20of,of%20annual%20heat%20stress%20exposure.\">reduce residents’ exposure to extreme heat by up to 91% over the course of a year</a>.</p><p>Longer-term efforts to reduce heat exposure and related health risks must be grounded in data that includes the potential for effective solutions. Studies can reveal not only how hot certain areas get but also the many ways communities face heat-related burdens. This helps cities prioritize where to focus resilience measures. </p><h3>Transport: Keeping Cities Moving in a Hotter World</h3><p>An essential part of urban life is the ability to move safely and efficiently through the city. As more cities embrace sustainable, zero-carbon transport options like electric buses, cycling and walking, extreme heat is prompting people to stay home or rely more on cars.</p><p>A 2024 study of several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Atlanta, Houston and New York, found that on extremely hot days, public transportation trips decline by <a href=\"https://www.cockrell.utexas.edu/news/archive/10071-extreme-heat-impacts-daily-routines-and-travel-patterns-study-finds\">an average of 50%</a> as people opt for air-conditioned vehicles. But for many without access to cars, there is no easy escape. Without adequate shade or heat protection at transit stops — a widespread problem in many cities — public transport users face greater risk of heat exposure. In Los Angeles, for example, only one-quarter of bus stops provide shelter despite frequently high temperatures.</p><p>Bicycle use also drops during extreme heat. In New York City, an analysis of bike-share ridership found that usage declined <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768325/\">by about one-third on days when temperatures exceeded 26 to 28 degrees C</a> (79 to 82 degrees F). Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/extreme-heat-air-pollution\">extreme heat can intensify air pollution</a>. This means that when people avoid sustainable transport options on hot days, it contributes to worsening air quality and compounds health risks for the city’s most vulnerable residents.</p><p>Cities must not only promote sustainable transport modes but also ensure that people can travel safely and comfortably, regardless of income or ability. For public transit like buses and light rail, increasing service frequency reduces the time people spend exposed to dangerous heat while waiting. Installing shade structures at transit stops and planting trees or green walls can also help ease heat burdens in these high-use spaces.</p><p>Green corridors — connected strips of green space such as trees, gardens or parks that link different parts of a city — can also create a network of cooler streets for people to cycle or walk on hot days.  Medellín, Colombia, has demonstrated the benefits of integrating urban greenery with sustainable mobility. Since 2016, the city’s Green Corridors program has linked more than 30 major streets with tree cover, vertical gardens and green spaces. Analyses show the corridors reduce temperatures <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/nature-positive-cities-tackle-extreme-heat/#:~:text=The%20green%20corridor%20initiative%20in,increasingly%20popular%20among%20urban%20planners.\">by an average of 2 degrees C</a> (3.6 degrees F), lower air pollution levels and encourage more trips on foot or by bike.</p><p>Similarly, studies in both <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/6/2569\">Houston, Texas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720301888?via%3Dihub#sec0040\">Shenzhen, China</a>, have found that tree canopy coverage and eye-level greenery support higher rates of cycling.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Man on bicycle in Shenzhen.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/shenzhen_0.jpg?VersionId=KxgHjFlEj7OCEIhXuVqNrWyJCWjO0d5P&itok=vm5LIuf3\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A cyclist navigates a street in Shenzhen, China, where research shows that more greenery and canopy cover encourage greater use of bicycles. Green spaces help cool cities while also promoting sustainable transport. Photo by Huy Bui Van/iStock photo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Jobs: Preparing the Urban Workforce for Extreme Heat</h3><p>Heat’s impact on city economies is layered. For informal or hourly wage workers, heat waves can reduce productivity, compromise work safety and lower incomes. In Dhaka, Bangladesh, for instance, manufacturing sectors such as garment and construction are already seeing <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/hot-cities-chilled-economies-dhaka/\">income losses of around 10%</a> as heat exposure hampers workers’ ability to produce efficiently in warehouses, outdoor work sites or manufacturing facilities. When a worker produces less, they earn less. At the sector level, slower production reduces revenue, which dampens the local economy as a whole.</p><p>The Atlantic Council’s Climate Resilience Center notes that women, especially those in informal jobs, are <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/2025/02/06/women-and-heat-surveys/\">particularly vulnerable to heat-related impacts</a>. In New Delhi’s textile markets, female garment workers spend their mornings sewing and packing bales of clothes for transport using open carts or rickshaws. However, because they aren’t allowed to deliver parcels until the afternoon, they must move during the hottest part of the day — often with their children in tow — exposing themselves to high levels of heat stress.</p><p>To build heat resilience across urban economies, cities need to prioritize both individual and system-level safety. Governments can create policies that protect workers on the job. California’s 2022 Heat Action Plan, for example, outlines recommendations to support safety for both outdoor and indoor workers at increased risk of heat impacts. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/recommendations-health-and-safety-amidst-heatwaves\">a 2024 report</a> from the International Labour Organization offers a suite of heat-related actions that local and national governments can adapt into policy, including mandated breaks, enforcement of cooling and ventilation standards in buildings, and regulations on maximum temperatures workers can be exposed to on the job.</p><p>Cities must also engage with the workers most at risk. In Freetown, Sierra Leone, Chief Heat Officer Eugenia Kargbo has led efforts to install weather-resistant and UV-protective <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/project/freetown-market-shade-cover-project/\">canopies</a> over vendor stalls — many of them run by women — to shield them from the city's heat.</p><h3>Economic Productivity: Heat Runs Up Systemic Costs</h3><p>Extreme urban heat doesn’t just affect individuals; it also carries a heavy price tag for cities as a whole. In the Los Angeles metro area, heat-driven productivity losses are estimated at <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/hot-cities-chilled-economies-los-angeles/#:~:text=Under%20current%20conditions%2C%20heat%20and,budget%20of%20USD%2011.2%20billion.&text=This%20is%20expected%20to%20rise%20to%20USD%2011%20billion%20annually%20by%202050.\">$5 billion a year</a>.</p><p>Cities also face rising energy demands, infrastructure damage and increased public health systems expenses. A World Bank report estimates that in Bangkok, a 1 degree C (1.8 degree F) temperature rise could increase energy costs by <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/shaping-a-cooler-bangkok-tackling-urban-heat-for-a-more-livable-city\">17 billion baht</a> (around half a billion U.S. dollars). <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/infrastructure/2023/06/28/455539/some-houston-area-roadways-buckling-under-prolonged-high-heat/\">A 2023 heat wave</a> in Houston caused roads to expand and buckle, leading to costly repairs for both the city and state. In London, a 2022 heat wave exposed a different type of infrastructure vulnerability: As temperatures spiked at 40 degrees C (104 degrees F), data centers at two National Health Service hospitals failed, causing weeks of delays in patient care and <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/outage-at-london-hospitals-cost-nhs-14m-when-heatwave-brought-down-two-data-centers/\">costing the system £1.4 million</a> to fix.</p><p>If cities want to safeguard their economies against heat-related losses, investing in wide-scale resilient infrastructure — such as green corridors, cool roofs and pavements, and strategic shade structures — is essential, along with targeted efforts to protect workers. There is no single quick fix to shield urban economies from heat, but every measure that protects people’s health, maintains transit systems and supports productivity will collectively strengthen the economy.</p><h3>Building Resilience in a Warming World</h3><p>Extreme urban heat is reshaping the very systems that keep cities functioning — from health to transportation to livelihoods. <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-cities-can-beat-the-extreme-heat/\">Building resilience</a> at both the individual and system levels — from the street vendors of Mathare to the bus lines in Chicago — is essential to protecting well-being, sustaining economic stability and ensuring cities can thrive in a hotter world.

      "description": "<p><strong>LONDON (June 5, 2025) </strong>— Today, the European Union adopted the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/news/commission-adopts-ocean-pact-protect-marine-life-and-strengthen-blue-economy-2025-06-05_en\">European Ocean Pact</a> — a unified strategy that aims to protect the ocean, promote a thriving blue economy and support the communities and livelihoods that depend on the ocean. The Pact comes days ahead of the UN Ocean Conference, where governments will convene in Nice, France to advance ocean action.</p><p>The Pact brings existing and new ocean policies under one coordinated framework, with six priorities: restoring ocean health, boosting the sustainable blue economy, supporting coastal and outermost regions, enhancing maritime security, advancing ocean knowledge and innovation and strengthening EU ocean diplomacy and governance. The EU manages the world’s largest collective maritime area.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Tom Pickerell, Global Director, Ocean Program, World Resources Institute: </strong></p><p>“The Pact sets a strong example for how EU countries can govern their ocean area in ways that improve coastal communities’ lives. It rightly places the ocean at the heart of Europe’s environmental, economic, and geopolitical future.</p><p>“We are encouraged by the Pact’s focus on integrated ocean policies, closer links between science and decision-making and stronger international cooperation. This aligns closely with the ambitions of the Ocean Panel, which includes 18 countries committed to sustainably managing 100% of their national ocean areas. The Pact’s push for ocean innovation, from offshore renewables and blue biotech to circular economy solutions and zero-carbon shipping, marks real progress toward a sustainable blue economy. And the Pact's attention to coastal communities and youth leadership signal that people who depend on the ocean are critical to protecting it.</p><p>“Now bold words must be backed by results. Many commitments lack clear timelines, targets and accountability. On finance, the Pact misses the mark by overlooking key tools such as blue bonds, blended finance and insurance mechanisms — essential for scaling investment and embedding ocean health into Europe’s economies. Without a clear strategy to build capacity in developing countries, its promise of inclusive global progress risks falling short.</p><p>“The EU must now deliver on commitments: support <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/sustainable-ocean-plans/\">national sustainable ocean plans</a>, unlock new funding — especially for vulnerable coastal and island states — and make sure ocean solutions are part of climate and nature action. It should also recognize the importance of blue foods for healthy diets, jobs and resilience.</p><p>“As leaders meet in Nice next week for the UN Ocean Conference, this is a vital moment for countries to restore the ocean’s health. Governments must ratify the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/high-seas-treaty-explainer\">High Seas Treaty</a>, protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 and back efforts to manage all national waters sustainably. With real investment and global cooperation, the EU Ocean Pact can turn ambition into action — at the UN Ocean Conference, at COP30, and beyond.”</p><p><em>Editor’s note: WRI serves as Secretariat of the </em><a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\"><em>High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy</em></a><em> — a group of 18 heads of state and government from countries committed to sustainably managing 100% of their national waters by 2030 — and coordinates the </em><a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\"><em>100% Alliance</em></a><em>, a global initiative co-led by Chile and France that encourages all countries to make that commitment.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>The ocean makes up nearly 70% of the planet’s surface, bursting with rich biodiversity and natural resources that are vital for both the climate and economies. Yet, beyond national coastlines, protecting much of the ocean has long been a murky endeavor.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, governments, scientists and ocean advocates have worked toward securing a global treaty to protect marine life in the ocean areas that lie beyond countries’ individual jurisdictions. These vast, mostly unregulated waters, known as the high seas, hold huge importance to the health of the planet.</p><p>Finally, in June 2023, the 193 member states of the United Nations adopted the landmark Treaty for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en\">BBNJ agreement</a>), under the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">UN Law of the Sea Convention</a> (UNCLOS).</p><p>Though the text of what is commonly known as the “High Seas Treaty,” has been agreed, the story is far from over. It’s <a href=\"https://highseasalliance.org/treaty-ratification/\">awaiting</a> the political will of 60 countries to ratify it, at which time it will trigger a 120-day countdown, leading to the first Conference of Parties (BBNJ COP) that will determine how it's fully implemented.</p><h3>Why the High Seas Treaty Matters</h3><p>The ambition of the High Seas Treaty has always been immense. Roughly two-thirds of the ocean lies outside any single country’s jurisdiction, forming a collective space teeming with life from microscopic plankton to colossal blue whales.</p><p>The high seas are also home to lucrative natural resources, which countries and companies increasingly seek to explore and exploit, such as critical minerals needed for EV batteries and other low carbon technologies and marine genetic materials that are increasingly sought after to support pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and other innovations.</p><p>Yet, without a binding treaty, the high seas are governed patchwork-style through regional fisheries agreements, shipping conventions and scattered marine protected areas. This leaves critical gaps in protecting marine biodiversity or ensuring developing countries are also benefiting from discoveries made in international water.</p><p>When ratified, the High Seas Treaty will fill critical regulatory gaps and complement national efforts. It will help to guide regional cooperation and link seamlessly to <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/sustainable-ocean-plans/\">sustainable ocean plans</a> for national waters already being delivered by member countries of the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\">High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy</a> (Ocean Panel) and future plans through the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance</a>. Together, they will weave a comprehensive net of ocean stewardship from coastlines to open ocean. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two divers swim near colorful coral reefs.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/coral-reef-high-seas_0.jpg?VersionId=dz33TQ2qAdQictZslfe_Ehf3w7B5jxG9&h=62bc044e&itok=eQ9bfSJ_\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The ocean is full of rich natural resources, like genetic material from coral, that countries and companies are looking to use for everything from pharmaceuticals to new technologies. The UN High Seas Treaty will help fill gaps needed to conserve and regulate these resources.

MPAs are typically clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystems.</p><p>Many MPAs on the high seas already exist. For example, in 2010, six MPAs were established in the Northeast Atlantic with a total area of 286,200 square kilometers (110,502 square miles) and in 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.asoc.org/campaign/ross-sea-mpa/\">Ross Sea MPA</a> with a total area of 1.5 million square kilometers (600,000 square miles) was established in the Southern Ocean.</p><p>The treaty will also establish a process for proposing new zones for protection via a consultation process, supported by scientific evidence.</p><h4>2) Marine Genetic Resources</h4><p>The treaty will also establish rules for sharing financial and non-financial benefits from the commercial application of genetic material sourced from high-seas marine organisms — such as bacteria, corals or deep-sea sponges — that can be used in medicine, cosmetics, food, and biotechnology. These innovations hold huge potential benefits for human health and wellbeing.</p><h4>3) Capacity Building and Transfer of Marine Technology</h4><p>The High Seas Treaty also supports sharing technology and knowledge developments, particularly to low-income countries that need and request it for conservation and sustainable use to ensure they participate fully in high seas governance.</p><h4>4) Environmental Impact Assessments</h4><p>The treaty will create a process for countries or companies proposing high seas activities — such as deep sea mining in areas beyond national borders — to conduct assessments and follow international standards, that can be shared transparently.</p><h3>Which Countries Have Signed the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>Just ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/un-ocean-conference-key-issues\">third UN Oceans Conference</a> (UNOC), taking place in Nice, France beginning June 9, the treaty was signed by 116 countries and ratified by 32. Those ratifying the treaty include island states such as Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Cuba, Dominica and the Maldives; the European Union and some of its members including France, Portugal and Spain; and other nations such as Chile, Norway and South Korea. More countries are expected to ratify the treaty during the conference.

Photo by the European Commission.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Why Is it Taking So Long for the Treaty to Ratify?</h3><p>Starting in the early 2000s, the United Nations began informal discussions on how to close the regulatory gaps over how to manage the high seas, wrangling over how to share the benefits of its natural resources while ensuring necessary protections.  But the very complexity of coordinating nearly 200 countries meant progress was often incremental, alternately buoyed by breakthroughs and bogged down by competing interests.</p><p>The slow ratification progress highlights both the strengths and limitations of international diplomacy. On the one hand, global consensus ensures that the resulting High Seas Treaty creates a single set of rules for all high-seas users. On the other hand, aligning the diverse interests of small island states, distant water fishing nations and environmental non-profit organizations is inherently time-consuming. Each negotiating text must thread the needle between these interests, with every word or comma potentially sparking months of debate.</p><p>Moreover, the decision-making processes of the UN, anchored in principles of sovereign equality and consensus-building, can struggle to keep pace with the urgent, evolving threats that marine ecosystems face: like the increasing demand for deep-sea minerals, growing plastic pollution and overfishing practices. By the time a treaty is finalized, new pressures may emerge, requiring fresh rounds of technical and legal work.</p><p>Countries, operating within their own jurisdictions — also known as exclusive economic zones, which extend 200 nautical miles from a country’s coastline — can make more immediate progress on conservation and climate initiatives. For example, <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\">Ocean Panel members</a> are sustainably managing 100% of their national waters. The process for developing these holistic sustainable ocean plans, while not simple, has been faster than multilateral processes. Ocean Panel members are now calling on all coastal and ocean states to replicate this success in their own national waters by 2030 by joining the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance</a>.</p><h3>What’s Next for the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>At this month’s UNOC, it’s expected that many UN member states will announce either their signing or ratification of the High Seas Treaty. However, for it to be effective, it is crucial that the underlying framework and governance structures are agreed upon before coming into force. The BBNJ Preparatory Commission (BBNJ PrepCom) hopes to fill this gap: shaping the treaty operations and preparing for the first BBNJ COP.</p><p>Governments and negotiators are hoping to develop key recommendations to shape the critical elements of the treaty. This includes forming governing structures; outlining the roles and responsibilities of institutions such as those that provide data, and scientific and technical advice; creating tools and mechanisms to ensure equitable implementation of the treaty; and establishing systems to ensure funding and technical knowledge is distributed so all member states can fully participate.  </p><p>The first BBNJ COP will see these recommendations brought forward and hopefully adopted. It is critical therefore that these meetings are constructive and that a consensus is reached. Only with the relevant governing and financial mechanisms in place can this High Seas Treaty go from a landmark agreement to a fully functioning international treaty that protects the global ocean.</p><p>Management of the ocean needs to be as interconnected as the ocean itself. By weaving together national actions with a robust global treaty, the world can ensure a resilient, equitable and thriving ocean for generations to come.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Energy services are fundamental to socioeconomic development and human well-being. Yet access remains scarce in many parts of the world. In Kenya, <a href=\"https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/country/kenya\">13 million people</a> still lack electricity access, and over 39 million continue to use unhealthy, polluting fuels for cooking.</p><p>WRI, in collaboration with over 300 partners, developed the <a href=\"https://www.energyaccessexplorer.org/\">Energy Access Explorer</a> (EAE) to help bring electricity to unserved and underserved communities. Currently available in eight countries across Africa and Asia, EAE is an online, open-source, interactive platform that enables clean energy players to map energy access gaps, identify high priority areas for energy interventions, and expand access faster and more equitably.</p><p>In Kenya, EAE is already being used to inform the design of County Energy Plans, as mandated by the country's <a href=\"https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2019/1/eng@2019-03-29\">Energy Act of 2019</a>. These plans require granular data on demographics and productive uses of renewable energy to assess current and potential electricity demand. They also require data on infrastructure and resource availability to map energy supply. But this is where current data comes up short: While Kenya has significantly scaled up solar power access in recent years, it does not have detailed information on where small-scale solar PV systems are located. This data is currently only available at coarse resolutions (at the sub-county level rather than building level; Figure 1), which limits inclusive planning efforts.</p><p><strong>Simply put: If energy planners and clean energy businesses don't know which buildings are powered by solar systems, how can they effectively plan for the expansion of energy services to underserved communities?</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1600\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1280\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"980\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"772\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"462\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Map showing household solar power use in Kenya at the county level.\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/kenya-household-solar-pv-map-wri_0.png?VersionId=kSfBEPDLdEU8qRNce1DEdjFQ70jzfvmG&itok=fXxLfzsf\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Illuminating Kenya's Solar Landscape</h3><p>To bridge this knowledge gap, WRI, in partnership with OMDENA, piloted the use of AI and Earth Observation (EO) technologies to generate high-resolution mapping of solar PV systems on building rooftops. We started with in Kilifi County, Kenya; specifically, Kilifi South, where about <a href=\"https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-iv-distribution-of-population-by-socio-economic-characteristics\">1 in 5 people</a> use solar power as their main source for lighting.</p><p>First, we collected data from various sources, including open-access satellite imagery from <a href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-1\">Sentinel-1</a> and <a href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-2\">Sentinel-2</a>, high-resolution images from <a href=\"https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/map-tiles/\">Google Maps Static API</a> images, and publicly available research datasets. Once we gathered the images, we processed them to enhance their quality. This included removing blurry parts or noise and enhancing their resolution. Given the limitations of open-access data, we mainly relied on high-resolution imagery from Google Maps for higher accuracy.</p><p>After enhancing the image quality, we manually labelled the location of solar panels in the high-resolution images using <a href=\"https://earthengine.google.com/\">Google Earth Engine</a> to build a robust training dataset. To increase the variety of training examples, we also divided larger images into smaller sections and applied simple transformations, like rotating or flipping.</p><p>This labeled dataset was then used to train our AI object detection model, built using <a href=\"https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-yolov8/\">YOLOv8</a><sup>1</sup>, which is designed to efficiently and accurately identify solar panels.</p><p>Once the model was trained, we first tested its performance on a separate set of images that had not been used during training. This achieved an accuracy of 94% based on common evaluation methods (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall\">precision, recall and F1 scores</a>). To further assess its real-world applicability, we conducted cross-validation using manually labeled ground truth data from Kilifi South. This step allowed us to measure how well the model could detect solar panels in new, unseen imagery (Figure 2). High precision (the model's prediction was correct in more than 90% of cases) indicated that most detected solar panels were indeed true solar panels, while high recall suggested that the model successfully identified most solar panels present in the images.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1500\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"919\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"433\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Photos of roofs with solar panels next to AI-generated images detecting the panels.\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/solar-pv-detection-model-results-wri_0.png?VersionId=c1nNOSy1O3bjWqFImYcuI.EksHjE4xHY&itok=mgK__MjT\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>We then applied the model to satellite images of Kilifi South sub-county to map the locations of solar panels in the area and create a georeferenced<sup>2</sup> dataset: a digital map layer showing where solar panels are installed.

With <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf\">scientific consensus</a> that carbon dioxide removal is needed to complement deeper emissions reductions, there’s growing interest in leveraging the ocean’s natural processes to pull more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>New Blue Paper on mCDR</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">A new <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OP_mCDR_Blue-Paper-1.pdf\">blue paper on principles for responsible marine carbon dioxide removal</a> commissioned by <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/members/\">Ocean Panel member countries</a> summarizes the state of knowledge around mCDR approaches, lays out international governance considerations, and recommends ways countries can develop mCDR approaches responsibly.</p></div><p>This is possible through <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal\">marine carbon dioxide removal</a> (mCDR) approaches, such as seaweed cultivation and sinking, ocean alkalinity enhancement and nutrient fertilization. Estimates indicate that <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/23_Ocean-Panel-Climate-Change_DOI.pdf#page=98\">mCDR could remove</a> billions of tons of carbon per year <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26278/a-research-strategy-for-ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-sequestration\">by midcentury</a>. But this massive potential is paired with an equally large uncertainty about both the efficacy of proposed approaches and the possibility of ecological and social impacts.  </p><p>Marine CDR approaches are in early stages of development today, with all tested close to countries’ coastlines in national waters and very few <a href=\"https://oceanvisions.org/mcdr-field-trials/\">tested at sea</a>. However, as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/U.S.-Marine-Carbon-Dioxide-Removal-Research-Strategy.pdf\">interest in mCDR</a> grows from countries and companies looking to meet net zero and other climate commitments, at-sea testing and deployment of approaches proven safe and effective will likely move into international waters. These waters, known as the high seas, make up around two-thirds of the world’s ocean.</p><p>For any marine carbon dioxide removal activity in the high seas, clear and comprehensive governance will be needed to ensure environmental safety, scientific integrity and compliance with international law. Today, mCDR is governed by the existing international treaties and agreements that protect the ocean and marine life. But because they generally were not written with marine CDR in mind, comprehensive and proactive regulation of marine carbon removal activities may require more specific governance frameworks.</p><h3>The State of mCDR Development and At-Sea Testing</h3><p>Interest and investment in marine carbon removal have been growing over the past few years both <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-carbon-dioxide-removal-us\">in the United States</a> and other countries, like <a href=\"https://cdrmare.de/en/\">Germany</a>, Iceland and Singapore.</p><p>In 2023, the U.S. published the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/interagency-ocean-policy/OCAP_Information\">Ocean Climate Action Plan</a>, a government-wide roadmap to leverage the ocean for climate mitigation. And in late 2024, it released a <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/white-house-noaa-and-other-federal-partners-release-national-strategy-for-marine-CO2-removal-research#:~:text=The%20strategy%20outlines%20how%20the,approaches%20are%20viable%20climate%20solutions.\">national mCDR research strategy</a> to address the objectives in the Ocean Climate Action Plan, including building a sufficient knowledge base about the efficacy and tradeoffs of different marine CDR approaches and developing a robust regulatory framework for their use. The federal government provided an initial <a href=\"https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/fy23-nopp-mcdr-awards/\">$24 million</a> for mCDR research projects in 2023; whether and how this work will continue under the Trump administration is uncertain. </p><p>In Germany, the <a href=\"https://cdrmare.de/en/die-mission/cdrmare-struktur/\">CDRmare project</a>, which runs through 2027, is working to assess if and how mCDR can play a role in removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In the EU, the <a href=\"https://seao2-cdr.eu/\">SEAO2-CDR project</a>, which also runs through 2027, is funded by the EU’s Horizon Europe, a research and innovation program, and includes interdisciplinary work to develop tools and guidelines to help ensure mCDR is developed responsibly and transparently.</p><p>Apart from national and supranational governments, interdisciplinary researchers <a href=\"https://www.agu.org/ethicalframeworkprinciples\">have developed</a> <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/a-code-of-conduct-for-marine-carbon-dioxide-removal-research/\">codes of conduct</a> to ensure responsible research. Groups like <a href=\"https://carbontosea.org/\">Carbon to Sea Initiative</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanvisions.org/our-strategy/remove/\">Ocean Visions</a> are supporting mCDR research with funding and other resources.</p><p>Projects are also beginning to move out of the lab and into the marine environment for testing along national coastlines. One <a href=\"https://subhaslab.whoi.edu/loc-ness/\">mCDR project</a> led by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts is in the process of applying for EPA permits to do ocean alkalinity enhancement testing off the state’s coast. Another project received a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to add <a href=\"https://www.vesta.earth/blog/duckannouncement?ref=tectonic.earth\">carbon-removing alkaline sand</a> offshore in North Carolina. In total, Ocean Visions <a href=\"https://oceanvisions.org/mcdr-field-trials/\">identifies 45 research trials</a> that are either in operation or concluded around the world, and six more than are approved to move forward.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21211827/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>As for projects in the high seas, a <a href=\"https://oceaniron.org/who-we-are/\">non-profit coalition</a> of researchers has announced its <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-will-engineer-the-ocean-to-absorb-more-carbon-dioxide/\">intention</a> to start research trials for ocean iron fertilization in international waters of the Pacific as early as 2026. The coalition plans to request approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/marine-protection-research-and-sanctuaries-act-mprsa-and-federal-facilities\">Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act</a>, the relevant domestic legal framework for this activity.  </p><p>Parties to the London Convention and Protocol — two international legal frameworks that govern activity on the high seas — <a href=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/01/09/international-governance-of-mcdr-small-steps-forward-but-much-more-work-to-do/\">have been meeting</a> to discuss governance of mCDR activity. In 2023, parties released a non-binding <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/MeetingSummaries/Pages/LC-45-LP-18.aspx\">statement</a> recommending that OAE and biomass sinking be treated similarly to ocean iron fertilization – namely that activity outside of legitimate scientific research be deferred.

Countries rely on global organizations like the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized UN agency, and the CBD Secretariat for support coordinating policy alignment and enforcement measures.</p><h3>How Does mCDR Fit into These Legal Frameworks?</h3><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21211248/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Under the <strong>United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</strong>, all parties are free to conduct <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part13.htm\">marine scientific research</a> in the high seas, if it is done peacefully and following “appropriate scientific methods.” However, UNCLOS does not define what constitutes marine scientific research and <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/3337/\">fails to differentiate</a> research conducted to expand knowledge from research that enables future commercial activity. (This is the case for other international law, too.) UNCLOS also includes <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part12.htm\">general obligations</a> for all parties to protect and preserve the marine environment — for example, by limiting marine pollution and avoiding the introduction of invasive species.</p><p>General provisions of the <strong>Convention on Biological Diversity</strong> relevant to mCDR include <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/default.shtml?a=cbd-07\">identification and monitoring</a> for activities likely to have a significant adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and a requirement for environmental impact assessments for certain activities. The CBD initially <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop?id=11659\">adopted a resolution</a> to ban commercial application of iron fertilization in 2008, and then <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop?id=12299\">expanded that in 2010</a> to ban all climate-related geoengineering activities except for small-scale scientific research studies in a controlled setting. While the resolution is nonbinding, it’s supported by 196 countries and was <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/0e90/5901/8f0161248348f0f8de760f20/cop-16-l-24-en.pdf\">reaffirmed at the UN Biodiversity Summit (COP16</a>), an indication of the strong lack of support for projects that are not “small scale” or “in a controlled setting.”  </p><p>The <strong>London Convention and the London Protocol</strong> focus on limiting dumping or disposal of wastes or other matter into marine waters. Whether mCDR approaches that add material to the ocean for carbon removal are considered dumping is a <a href=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/01/09/international-governance-of-mcdr-small-steps-forward-but-much-more-work-to-do/\">topic of continued debate</a>. The Convention includes a list of materials that cannot be dumped. The Protocol is stricter and includes a list of material that can be dumped (with a permit) and prohibits dumping everything else, with limited carve-outs.</p><p>Following the 2008 CBD resolution, the parties to both the London Convention and the London Protocol <a href=\"https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/LCLPDocuments/LC-LP.1%20(2008).pdf\">passed a resolution</a> agreeing that iron fertilization is within scope for both agreements, but that only legitimate scientific research is allowed. In 2010 the parties <a href=\"https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Environment/Documents/OFassessmentResolution.pdf\">adopted a tool</a> to determine if an activity constitutes legitimate scientific research. And in 2013, an <a href=\"https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/LCLPDocuments/LP.4(8).pdf\">amendment to the Protocol</a> officially banned iron fertilization except for legitimate scientific research, and an annex to that amendment determined that additional marine geoengineering techniques could fall under the scope of the amendment in the future. Only six of the LP’s 55 parties have ratified the amendment so far — fewer than the two-thirds needed to enforce it. This amendment is one of few examples of governance specific to certain mCDR techniques, but the Protocol’s ability to more comprehensively govern mCDR is limited by its overall aim of limiting ocean dumping.</p><p><strong>Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction</strong> is an agreement ratified under UNCLOS that <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-10&chapter=21&clang=_en\">opened for signature in 2023</a> and has not yet entered into force. Its objective is to create a comprehensive framework under UNCLOS to address sustainable use of biodiversity and conservation in areas beyond national jurisdiction. It does this <a href=\"https://illuminem.com/illuminemvoices/the-biodiversity-beyond-national-jurisdiction-treaty-and-its-implications-for-marinebased-carbon-dioxide-removal\">through two mechanisms</a>: environmental impact assessment and area-based management tools, such as marine protected areas that could be used to preclude mCDR testing in areas where no other existing international body has competency.</p><p>For environmental impact assessments, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/sites/default/files/2024-08/Text%20of%20the%20Agreement%20in%20English.pdf\">BBNJ</a> includes more specific requirements than UNCLOS, such as assessing whether the planned activity will have “<a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/sites/default/files/2024-08/Text%20of%20the%20Agreement%20in%20English.pdf#page=30\">more than a minor...effect</a>” on the marine environment and determining if the effects are not well understood. If either criterion is met, a screening process would determine whether an environmental impact assessment is needed. Since most mCDR methods have not been well studied, they would <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1217&context=sabin_climate_change\">likely trigger this screening</a>. Under BBNJ, a full environmental impact assessment would include the monitoring and reporting of <a href=\"https://bbnj-mgr.fas.harvard.edu/eias\">economic, social, cultural and human health impacts</a>. Following public comment of potentially affected parties, it would then be up to the state party with jurisdiction over the project to decide if it could go forward.</p><p>Aside from these legal frameworks, <strong>customary international law</strong> <a href=\"https://globalpact.informea.org/glossary/no-harm-rule\">arises from established international practices</a> and is generally binding on all states (unlike earlier frameworks which just apply to countries that are party to each agreement). Some aspects of customary international law are also enshrined in legal frameworks. For example, the “<a href=\"https://globalpact.informea.org/glossary/no-harm-rule\">no harm rule</a>” is included in the CBD, so parties to that agreement must adopt measures to enact these treaties domestically. The “no harm rule” means that all countries are obligated to prevent activities under their jurisdiction from causing significant harm to the territory of other countries and areas beyond the individual jurisdiction and control of countries, such as the high seas.</p><p>These legal frameworks are primarily designed to minimize harm, and mCDR approaches are intended to provide a net benefit to the climate while minimizing local harms. However, current legal frameworks are not designed to weigh that benefit against any harms introduced by the mCDR activity. In this way, current legal frameworks are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/responsible-informed-ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal\">not well suited</a> to governing mCDR activities.</p><h3>Applying International Legal Frameworks to mCDR in the High Seas </h3><p>Marine CDR activities in the high seas will be <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1430957/full#h7\">governed by the country</a> that <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Legal/Pages/Registration-of-ships-and-fraudulent-registration-matters.aspx\">registered the vessel</a> performing those activities or the country where it is loaded with material for the activities. Countries that are parties to international legal frameworks are obligated to create mechanisms to enforce them domestically. And in some cases, countries that are not parties also have domestic laws implementing these frameworks. For example, the United States is not a party to the London Protocol, but the U.S. EPA’s Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act is a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/london-convention-and-london-protocol-international-treaties-prevent-marine-pollution\">domestic application</a> of the London Protocol’s anti-dumping aims. While the regulation of activities in the high seas would fall under relevant national laws, how the regulation is approached would likely be influenced by ongoing discussions among parties to each legal framework. </p><h6>International framework governance of selected mCDR approaches</h6><table border=\"1\" class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th width=\"91\"><strong>Approach</strong></th><th width=\"149\"><strong>UNCLOS</strong></th><th width=\"156\"><strong>LC/LP</strong></th><th width=\"158\"><strong>CBD</strong></th><th width=\"65\"><strong>BBNJ</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td width=\"91\"><strong>All approaches</strong></td><td width=\"149\">General provisions around protection of the marine environment and marine scientific research.</td><td width=\"156\">General obligation of employing a precautionary approach. mCDR activities could be permissible if deemed to be for purposes other than mere disposal, to not run contrary to the aims of the LC/LP and to constitute “legitimate scientific research.”</td><td width=\"158\">General provisions on identification and monitoring, and environmental impact assessments.</td><td rowspan=\"4\" width=\"65\"><p><em> </em></p><p><em>If passed, all approaches will be subject to spatial regulations established through area-based management tools and could be evaluated through environmental impact assessments.</em></p></td></tr><tr><td width=\"91\"><strong>Seaweed cultivation and sinking</strong></td><td width=\"149\">Regulates the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part12.htm\">new or alien species</a>.

This potential coincides with growing demand for legal clarity on country obligations to address climate change under international law. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea released an <a href=\"https://itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_350_EN.pdf\">advisory opinion</a> in May 2024 emphasizing the responsibility of countries under UNCLOS to prevent, reduce and control greenhouse gas emissions to protect the marine environment, and the International Court of Justice is likely to clarify similar obligations under broader treaties sometime this year. These opinions will dually guide countries’ responsibility to climate action and appropriate caution in mCDR implementation.</p><p>In 2025, discussions about these issues will continue under the London Protocol and the London Convention, <a href=\"http://www.gesamp.org/\">scientific experts</a> under the United Nations will propose a new framework to assess projects, and global forums like the UN Ocean Conference and <a href=\"https://www.ouroceanconference.org/\">Our Ocean Conference</a> will convene ocean experts on topics including mCDR. The coming years will see countries advancing interdisciplinary research, including on the evaluation of social and environmental impacts, informed by <a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/noaa-and-carbon-to-sea-team-up-to-develop-data-management-guidelines-for-marine-carbon-dioxide-removal-projects/\">emerging data-sharing and management guidelines.</a> And, as individual projects move forward, transparent communication within and among countries on the impacts and benefits will provide a greater shared understanding for updating the relevant international governance frameworks to consider this potential climate solution.</p><p><em><strong>Editor's Note: </strong>This article was first published on Feb. 10, 2025.

      "description": "<p>The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet. It provides food for over 3 billion people, regulates the climate, sustains global economies and is a source of cultural identity for communities around the world. But it’s also under intense and mounting pressure from climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.</p><p>It’s the ocean’s criticality that brings world leaders together for the third <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/civil-society/un-ocean-conference\">UN Ocean Conference (UNOC)</a> in Nice, France from June 9<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>Occurring every three years, UNOC invites world leaders, civil society, businesses and scientists to mobilize partnerships, commitments and solutions to address ocean challenges. The summit plays a vital role in activating international cooperation and securing progress for ocean health and resilience.</p><p>A major outcome is the Political Declaration proposed ahead of the conference and formally adopted at its end. While not legally binding, the Political Declaration sets the tone and ambition for global ocean action. It serves as a signal to governments, investors and civil society that ocean health is a political priority, and it helps mobilize support for new initiatives.</p><p>While there are undoubtedly some gaps in a consensus-based statement like this, the ocean community has placed a great deal of expectation on UNOC to deliver significant outcomes for sustainable development, climate change and biodiversity loss. In a year filled with <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/opportunities-ocean-action-2025\">opportunities for the ocean</a>, the Nice summit could help reshape how we govern and invest in our ocean, ensuring it continues to support people and the planet for generations to come.</p><p>Here are the key areas that need to be addressed for the 2025 UN Ocean Conference to serve as a turning point for the ocean:</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Commercial fishing boat in Nordic region\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/commercial-fishing-boat_0.jpg?VersionId=KumA.n2Z7iaPt2Z5z9B2PNvvynkH48G0&h=2e5cdddf&itok=-w457uVR\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>1) Scale Up Funding for Sustainable Development Goal 14.</h3><p>The ocean economy is worth an estimated <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/the-agenda/ocean-wealth/\">$2.5 trillion annually, with an asset value of $24 trillion</a>. Yet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Below Water, remains the most underfunded of all the SDGs, <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Tracking_Investment_in_and_Progress_Toward_SDG14.pdf\">receiving less than 0.01% of all sustainable development funding</a>. This is not an oversight, it’s a crisis.</p><p>This funding gap is holding back critical progress on marine conservation, fisheries reform, and the blue economy, where every <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/a-sustainable-ocean-economy-for-2050-approximating-its-benefits-and-costs/\">$1 invested yields at least $5 in global benefits by 2050.</a> Within a  sustainable ocean economy, employment could grow <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/ocean-employment/\">by 51 million jobs by 2050</a>, reaching 184 million people globally.</p><p>What’s more is that what little finance does flow to the ocean often misses the people who need it most. Finance tools should prioritize equitable access, channeling support to Indigenous and local communities, small-scale fishers, and women-led initiatives, who are often on the frontlines of ocean stewardship and the ocean’s most pressing challenges.</p><p>UNOC and its preceding event, the <a href=\"https://beff2025monaco.org/\">Blue Economy and Finance Forum</a>, presents a critical opportunity to establish and strengthen pathways for concrete public and private financial commitments to support SDG 14. Expectations are for announcements of new and scaled-up funding from Multilateral Development Banks, governments and private sector institutions, as well as investments in innovative finance tools such as blue bonds, blended finance and ocean-focused impact funds.</p><p>In anticipation, the UN released its <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/publications/ocean-investment-protocol/#:~:text=The%20Ocean%20Investment%20Protocol%20is,Water%20%E2%80%94%20and%20other%20related%20SDGs.\">Ocean Investment Protocol</a>, which provides a framework on how to unlock private capital for the sustainable ocean economy. The guide outlines how financial institutions, (re)insurers, ocean industries, governments and development finance institutions can mobilize and scale ocean finance.</p><h3>2) Cement the Ocean’s Role in Fighting Climate Change.</h3><p>The ocean is often overlooked in climate negotiations, yet it holds enormous potential to help limit global warming. Research from the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel) shows that ocean-based climate solutions — including offshore renewable energy, sustainable shipping, protection and restoration of “blue carbon” ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses, and more — could deliver <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/ocean-solutions-to-climate-change/\">up to 35%</a> of the emissions reductions needed by 2050 to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).</p><p> </p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1500\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"919\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"433\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart showing potential emissions reductions from ocean-based climate strategies by 2050.\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2023-09/23-Ocean%20Climate%20Action_Insights.png?VersionId=Jwrr73CeILX_BPgf98ZDfWy7agKxB3Uy&itok=gmzwT47Z\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p> </p><p>Despite this, ocean-based action remains largely absent from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/assessing-2025-ndcs\">national climate commitments</a>. UNOC must send a clear message ahead of <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/cop30\">COP30 in Belém, Brazil</a>: We cannot meet our climate goals without fully integrating ocean action into national and global climate strategies.</p><p>Countries should see Nice as an opportunity to commit to including ocean-based mitigation and adaptation measures in their next round of national climate plans (<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs</a>), due by the end of this year. WRI published <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/ndcs/resources/ocean-sector\">guidance</a> on this, and there will be a series of events in Nice looking ahead to COP30.   </p><h3>3) Accelerate Movement on International Goals and Treaties.</h3><p>The High Seas Treaty, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-countries-agree-historic-treaty-protect-worlds-high-seas\">adopted in 2023</a>, was a historic breakthrough for ocean governance. It provides the first-ever legal framework to protect biodiversity in the high seas — the two-thirds of the ocean that lie beyond national jurisdiction.</p><p>But for the treaty to take effect, it needs to be ratified by at least 60 countries. To date, fewer than 30 have done so.</p><p>UNOC is a strategic opportunity to drive ratification, which is also critical to achieving international goals like the <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/gbf\">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a> to protect 30% of the ocean and land by 2030 (30x30). While the UNOC is not a formal deadline for achieving the 60 ratifications required for the High Seas Treaty to enter into force, the treaty is open for signature until <a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en#:~:text=The%20Agreement%20is%20open%20for,%2C%20approval%2C%20acceptance%20or%20accession.\">September 20, 2025</a>, with activities in Nice serving as one of the last opportunities for widespread movement on the issue. Without action on the high seas, the 30x30 target will be nearly impossible to meet.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"938\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1500\" />\n              <source height=\"788\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"603\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"475\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"285\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Fiji coral reef\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/fiji-coral-reef_0.jpg?VersionId=f5Dk7p6iLzGpzrUZPJgjtMWCkCuFoRDT&itok=tjiOe_fq\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A vibrant coral reef off the coast of Fiji. The nation is one of several developing a Sustainable Ocean Plan.

Protecting 30% is essential — but for those protections to be effective, the other 70% must be sustainably managed. This includes bringing national waters (which make up around 40% of the ocean) under holistic sustainable management. This approach has long been championed by WRI. It was included in the proposed Nice <a href=\"https://www.un.org/pga/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/05/UNOC3-declaration-final.pdf\">Political Declaration, </a> but still must be formally adopted at the conference.</p><p>A growing number of nations, including Norway, Fiji and Indonesia, have or are in the middle of developing <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/publication/100-sustainable-ocean-management-an-introduction-to-sustainable-ocean-plans/\">Sustainable Ocean Plans (SOPs)</a> that reflect this vision. These plans serve as a unifying umbrella for ocean-related governance and a policy framework that facilitates holistic and sustainable use of the ocean. WRI’s <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance campaign</a> calls on<em> all </em>coastal and ocean states to unite in the commitment to 100% sustainable ocean management and provide the technical and financial assistance needed to develop SOPs.</p><h3>A Strong Outcome at the UN Ocean Conference Can Lay the Groundwork for Climate and Biodiversity Gains</h3><p>Too often, global efforts on climate, biodiversity and the ocean operate in silos. But these crises and their solutions are deeply interconnected. A healthy ocean is essential for a stable climate, rich biodiversity and resilient coastal economies.</p><p>A strong outcome from the UN Ocean Conference can help lay the groundwork for climate and biodiversity gains through the UN Climate Conference (COP30) in November 2025 and the Biodiversity COP17 in 2026. Momentum at UNOC can help ensure that the ocean takes its place as a unifying force that helps overcome our planet’s greatest challenges.</p><p>To get there, leaders must bring urgency and ambition— linking ocean action to climate commitments, backing it with finance, and embedding it in a broader vision for resilience. A thriving, sustainable ocean economy is not just a “nice-to-have;” it’s essential for a more prosperous future where people and nature thrive.</p>",

      "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Washington, D.C. (June 3, 2025)</strong> — As climate hazards like floods and wildfires intensify — and global financial resources grow tighter — </span><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">a new study</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\"> by World Resources Institute (WRI) presents powerful evidence that bolstering funding for adaptation and resilience is not only urgent but also one of the smartest development investments available today.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The study, which analyzed 320 adaptation and resilience investments across 12 countries totaling $133 billion, finds that every $1 invested in adaptation and resilience generates more than $10 in benefits over ten years. This translates to potential returns of over $1.4 trillion, with average returns of 27%.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Some sectors record even greater returns. Health sector investments, for example, are projected to deliver returns of over 78%, driven by the high benefits of protecting lives from climate-related impacts like heat stress, malaria and dengue fever. Investments in disaster risk management, such as early warning systems, also showed exceptionally high returns derived from safeguarding lives and infrastructure.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The study defines adaptation investments as those aimed at reducing or managing physical climate risks, such as climate-smart agriculture, expanded health services and urban flood protection. However, in many cases, the resulting development and social benefits matched or exceeded the avoided losses from climate impacts. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“This research has pried open the lid on what resilience is truly worth — and even that first glimpse is staggering\", said <strong>Sam Mugume Koojo</strong>, Co-Chair of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action from Uganda. “It's time for leaders to recognize climate adaptation is not just a safety net but a launch pad for development.”</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">WRI evaluated projects based on three key types of returns (commonly referred to as the “triple dividend of resilience”): avoided losses from climate disasters; induced economic gains (e.g. job creation and increased crop yields); and broader social and environmental benefits (e.g. improved health systems, biodiversity). On average, benefits were fairly evenly distributed across all three types. Yet only 8% of investment appraisals estimated the full monetized values of these dividends — suggesting that actual rates of return are substantially underestimated in economic assessments of most adaptation investments.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Benefits beyond avoiding climate shocks</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">While adaptation investments have traditionally focused on reducing climate vulnerability and strengthening the resilience of investments, the study finds that over 50% of their documented benefits occur even if climate-related disasters do not happen. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Infrastructure built to better manage extreme weather events may provide year-round value: irrigation systems can support diverse cropping patterns and evacuation centers may double as community hubs. Nature-based solutions — such as watershed, wetland and coastal protections — frequently provide added ecological and recreational benefits.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">These findings demonstrate that investing in adaptation is not just a protective measure — it also helps advance countries’ broader development priorities and sustainable development goals.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“One of our most striking findings is that adaptation projects aren’t just paying off when disasters happen — they generate value every day through more jobs, better health and stronger local economies,\" said <strong>Carter Brandon</strong>, Senior Fellow, WRI. “That’s a major mind shift: policymakers don’t need a disaster to justify resilience — it’s simply smart development.”</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Adaptation investments also cut carbon and protect nature</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Nearly half of the analyzed adaptation investments are also expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions, showing that adaptation and mitigation often go hand in hand. This overlap could open the door to greater climate finance from investors focused on lowering emissions. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The strongest examples of this win-win were found in energy, forestry, transport, cities and agriculture sectors. Many of these projects use nature-based solutions that sequester carbon and deliver ecological benefits, such as urban tree planting to reduce heat or stabilizing hillsides to reduce erosion.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Recommendations for policymakers</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Based on these findings, WRI recommends that government leaders treat adaptation as an engine for economic opportunity and fully integrate resilience into national development strategies. The paper also calls for a standardized approach to measuring and reporting adaptation outcomes, which would improve investments' comparability, transparency and accountability. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The study builds on the </span><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-global-leaders-call-urgent-action-climate-adaptation-commission-finds-adaptation-can\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Adapt Now report</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\"> released by WRI and the Global Commission on Adaptation in 2019</span><span> and was prompted by the G20 and the government of Brazil's interest in better evidence of economic benefits from investing in resilience.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“This evidence gives leaders and non-State actors exactly what they need heading into COP30: a clear economic case for scaling adaptation,” said <strong>Dan Ioschpe</strong>, Climate High-Level Champion for COP30.  “Belém must become a turning point – mainstreaming resilience into national and local priorities and unlocking the full potential of non-state actors' leadership.”</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>About World Resources Institute</strong></span> <br /><span lang=\"EN-US\">WRI is a trusted partner for change.

In 2024 alone, the world endured <a href=\"https://www.ajg.com/gallagherre/-/media/files/gallagher/gallagherre/news-and-insights/2025/natural-catastrophe-and-climate-report-2025.pdf\">58 disasters</a> that wreaked over a billion dollars in damages each. Yet finance to cope with and respond to these impacts falls persistently short: The gap between funding needed to adapt to climate change and what is currently available is as high as <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024\">$359 billion per year</a>.</p><p>Part of the reason is that adaptation measures, such as strengthening early warning systems or making infrastructure more resilient, are seen only as a way to avoid potential losses — not as a broader investment opportunity. But this underestimates the true value of adaptation and the returns it can bring.</p><p>New <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\">WRI research</a> finds that investing $1 in adaptation can yield more than $10.50 in benefits over 10 years. This reflects not only the avoided losses from climate impacts, but also a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits that are generated even when disasters <em>don't </em>occur.</p><p>In other words, adaptation is not just a crucial response to the climate crisis; it is also one of the smartest investments of our time.</p><h3>The 'Triple Dividend' of Adaptation Investments</h3><p>In a new paper, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\"><em>Strengthening the Investment Case for Climate Adaptation</em></a>, WRI analyzed investments in 320 adaptation and resilience projects spanning agriculture, water, health and infrastructure. These ranged from upgrading food storage facilities in Bangladesh to improving water management in Brazil.</p><p>Cumulatively, the investments we analyzed cost over $133 billion and are expected to generate $1.4 trillion in benefits over 10 years. Individual investments were estimated to generate an impressive average return of 27%.</p><p>Moreover, many of the benefits expected from these investments were neither monetized nor included in the projected returns because they are difficult to model and quantify. Researchers found that only 8% of investment appraisals estimated the full monetized values of these dividends — suggesting that the $1.4 trillion and the average rate of return are likely substantial underestimates.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1156\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"925\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"708\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"558\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"334\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart showing the rate of return on climate adaptation investments by sector.\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/adaptation-returns-by-sector-wri_0.png?VersionId=j1_22FVj4O9WkzV3jEjs8J8ObBTqWvhm&itok=1rbfvADL\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>So, where do these returns come from? Our research used the \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/triple-dividend-building-climate-resilience-taking-stock-moving-forward\">triple dividend of resilience</a>\" framework to capture three key categories of returns on adaptation investments: avoided losses, induced economic development, and additional social and environmental benefits. We found that adaptation projects often have benefits evenly distributed across all three dividends — and generate higher rates of return than commonly assumed.</p><p>Consider an urban infrastructure project in Vietnam that aims to reduce flooding and improve water drainage. When estimating the return on this project, many models would consider only the avoided cost of flood damage. But investments in resilient infrastructure could also increase average land prices; decrease healthcare costs by reducing waterborne diseases; and boost workers' productivity by reducing travel time, thanks to new and improved roads. The triple dividend framework would account for all these outcomes, offering a more complete picture of the value that adaptation and resilience projects can bring.</p><h3>Good Adaptation Is Good Development</h3><p>Part of the challenge with funding adaptation is that it's often seen as an unaffordable, incremental cost that competes with other national development priorities. But the triple dividend framework reveals that the two often go hand in hand. In many of the investments we analyzed, adaptation efforts are key to unlocking resilient development.</p><h4>Health</h4><p>Adaptation investments in the health sector offer some of the highest returns of those we analyzed, averaging over 78%. This is because investing in more resilient health systems can save lives, improve public health and bolster economic productivity, especially among vulnerable populations.</p><p>For example, the Social and Economic Inclusion Project in Kenya targeted drought-prone regions, where climate shocks deepen poverty and vulnerability. Children are particularly affected: Droughts lead to increased levels of malnutrition and stunted growth, blocking them from reaching their full development potential.</p><p>Kenya's project aimed to address these issues by offering cash transfers and nutritional counseling during droughts, or by deploying community health workers to remote areas affected by climate hazards. It also looked to expand access to healthcare services more broadly, which in turn would boost productivity and learning outcomes among poor and vulnerable households. This is expected to bring significant development gains on top of avoided losses, making the project a model for health-centered adaptation.</p><h4>Disaster risk management</h4><p>Investments in disaster risk management also deliver high returns — nearly 36% on average — by safeguarding lives and infrastructure while minimizing economic disruption. This is particularly true of <a href=\"https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/uploads/GlobalCommission_Report_FINAL.pdf?_gl=1*f6ke33*_gcl_au*NTc4MzYyODM3LjE3NDE3MTU4ODQ.\">cost-effective tools</a> like early warning systems.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A farmer harvests rice from a flooded field.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/bangladesh-farmer-flooded-rice-field_0.jpg?VersionId=gMk2Vvg0dDc_9Q_Pi6Aw2AOzH1WrnBsK&itok=4Ar8XDUr\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A farmer in Sunamganj, Bangladesh harvests rice paddy from a flooded field after torrential rains in 2022.

It also set up an online information portal as well as physical kiosks and display boards to provide farmers with easier access to weather and water-related information. This is expected to help farmers better manage climate risks and protect their livelihoods — not only avoiding weather-related losses but also boosting their incomes in the long-term.</p><h4>Sustainable agriculture and forestry</h4><p>Adaptation returns in the agriculture and forestry sector average over 29%, largely driven by developmental gains like higher yields and productivity, as well as environmental benefits.</p><p>Ethiopia's Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project restored degraded landscapes in selected watersheds through measures such as hillside terraces and tree planting. At the same time, it trained communities in sustainable farming and grazing practices. Together, these measures could improve soil health, reduce erosion and enhance watersheds, making the area more resilient to floods and droughts while also improving crop and livestock production.</p><h4>Resilient infrastructure</h4><p>Projects focused on resilient energy, cities and transport systems offer wide-ranging benefits, with an average return on investment of close to 30%.</p><p>For example, the Sustainable Urban Development Project in Fortaleza, Brazil, restored natural wetlands in <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/02/27/brasil-preparar-cidades-mudancas-climaticas-solucoes-natureza\">Rachel de Quieroz Park</a> to help soak up and hold stormwater. This buffers surrounding neighborhoods from floods while enhancing biodiversity. It also created new public spaces and revitalized existing green areas, which can attract more visitors and businesses, raise property values, and improve water quality and living conditions. Crucially, the project emphasized social benefits for women, who make up most of Fortaleza's population and are overrepresented in its low-income neighborhoods.</p><h4>Water</h4><p>Managing water is fundamental to climate resilience. Worsening storms and floods inundate entire cities; crippling droughts parch farmland; and intensifying climate risks threaten water supplies. In our study, water-related projects saw 19% returns on average — although this does not fully capture the range of benefits from investing in the water sector, which are often difficult to measure and quantify.</p><p>The Transformative Riverine Management Project in Durban, South Africa, is leveraging nature-based solutions, such as creating and rehabilitating wetlands, to address water risks. This generates benefits across all three dividends: It reduces flood-related losses by improving water absorption. It yields economic benefits, such as creating new jobs and increasing food production and bioenergy generation. It also brings social and environmental benefits, like reducing erosion, improving local water quality, sequestering planet-warming carbon and creating spaces to enjoy the outdoors. The estimated benefits from this project are valued at nearly six times the project cost.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Commuters stuck at a flooded river with a damaged bridge.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-05/durban-flood_0.jpg?VersionId=fd4_TSkSXs88Yqc8hksDyTZ6ztEtX5_I&h=2e111cc1&itok=skLRYhet\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>People cross a flooded river in Durban, South Africa in 2022.

In fact, over 65% of the monetized benefits in our study were unrelated to expected climate shocks — from job creation and productivity gains to healthier communities and environments.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1127\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"901\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"690\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"544\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"325\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart showing how returns on adaptation investments are distributed across avoided losses and environmental, social and economic benefits. \" height=\"325\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/adaptation-triple-dividend-wri_0.png?VersionId=bwueEKtju.JkI_JFPhpKK6AQIgbGPMdA&itok=2l41Ifta\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In many cases, these broader development gains matched or exceeded the value of avoided losses.</p><p>For example, China's Hubei Yichang Rural Green Development Project seeks to modernize the agricultural sector in Yichang Municipality by investing in modern agricultural practices and technology; installing treatment systems for agricultural waste and water; and improving climate-resilient rural infrastructure, such as building more efficient irrigation systems and better drainage. The projected productivity and resilience gains from these efforts surpass the amount that could be saved through avoided flood losses.</p><h3>Adaptation Investments Also Curb Emissions</h3><p>While our study largely focused on the triple dividend of adaptation investments, the benefits don't stop there.</p><p>Climate mitigation — efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and curb temperature rise — has historically been siloed from adaptation in international climate negotiations and policy planning. The two are often viewed as competing priorities, vying for limited climate finance.</p><p>However, nearly half of the adaptation investments we analyzed helped to lower GHG emissions, revealing untapped opportunities to align strategies and unlock more finance. This shows that investing in adaptation can be a powerful tool to help curb temperature rise while also building resilience against future risks.</p><p>The Heritage Colombia Project, for example, is working to restore forest ecosystems in degraded areas and improve land and forest management: two strategies that can increase natural carbon removal. The value of these GHG emissions reductions is estimated at $1.45 billion — topping the estimated value of avoided losses ($1.2 billion) and significantly larger than the $31 million estimated in other social and environmental benefits.</p><h3>Unlocking Adaptation's Full Value</h3><p>Looking at the full picture puts adaptation in a new light. Our research challenges the mindset that adaptation is a financial burden, pulling limited funds from other priorities. It proves that it is often much more profitable to adapt than not to do so — and that good adaptation is, in fact, good development.</p><p>But despite a compelling investment case, the adaptation finance gap remains.</p><p>More work is needed to build on these learnings and further demystify adaptation's contribution to development goals. Improving the data collection, monitoring and evaluation systems for adaptation investments — both before and after implementation —<span> </span>can deepen our understanding of their diverse benefits. More evidence on the realized impacts of adaptation investments, coupled with improved cost-benefit methodologies, could help refine our understanding of their benefits across all three dividends and attract additional finance from more diverse sources.</p><p>The adaptation finance gap isn't just a shortfall — it's a missed opportunity. Every year of delay leaves communities exposed to escalating climate risks and foregoes significant economic, social and environmental benefits from resilient development. It's time for governments and development partners to make one of the smartest investments for both people and the planet.</p><p><em>Editor's note: The title of this article was changed from \"The Compelling Business Case for Climate Adaptation\" to \"The Compelling Investment Case for Climate Adaptation\" to more accurately reflect the scope of the underlying research, which applies to investments by governments and donors as well as businesses.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>2025 is a pivotal moment for climate action. Countries are submitting new climate commitments, otherwise known as \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">Nationally Determined Contributions</a>\" or \"NDCs,\" that will shape the trajectory of global climate progress through 2035.</p><p>These new commitments will show how boldly countries plan to cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, transform their economies, and strengthen resilience to growing threats like extreme weather, wildfires and floods. Collectively, they will determine how far the world goes toward limiting global temperature rise and avoiding the worst climate impacts.</p><p>A few countries, such as the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, have already put forward new climate plans — and their ambition is a mixed bag. But it's still early: Many more countries, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to reveal their NDCs and are expected to do so in the coming months.</p><p>We analyzed the initial submissions for a snapshot of how countries' climate plans are shaping up so far and what they reveal about the road ahead.</p><h3>Where the World Stands on Curbing Climate Change Today</h3><p>A decade ago, the world was headed toward <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf\">3.7-4.8 degrees C</a> (6.7-8.6 degrees F) of warming by 2100, threatening catastrophic weather, devastating biodiversity loss and widespread economic disruptions. In response, the Paris Agreement set a global goal: limit temperature rise to well below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and strive to limit it to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), thresholds scientists say can significantly lessen climate hazards. Though some impacts are inevitable — with extreme heat, storms, fires and floods already worsening — lower levels of warming dramatically reduce their severity. Every fraction of a degree matters.</p><p>To keep the Paris Agreement's temperature goals within reach, countries agreed to submit new NDCs every five years. These national plans detail how (and how much) each country will cut emissions, how they'll adapt to climate impacts like droughts and rising seas, and what support they'll need to deliver on those efforts. </p><p>Countries have gone through two rounds of NDCs so far, in 2015 and 2020-2021, with their commitments extending through 2030. </p><p>While the latest NDCs cut emissions more deeply than those from 2015, they still fall short of the ambition needed to hold warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees C. If fully implemented (including measures that require international support), they could bring down projected warming to <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/nations-must-close-huge-emissions-gap-new-climate-pledges-and\">2.6-2.8 degrees C</a> (4.7-5 degrees F). And without stronger policies to meet countries' targets, the world could be heading for a far more dangerous <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/nations-must-close-huge-emissions-gap-new-climate-pledges-and\">3.1 degrees C</a> (5.6 degrees F) of warming by 2100.</p><p>Now the third round is underway, with countries expected to set climate targets through 2035.</p><p>These new NDCs are expected to reflect the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop28-outcomes-next-steps\">outcomes</a> of the 2023 Global Stocktake, which was the first comprehensive assessment of global climate progress under the Paris Agreement. In addition to bigger emissions cuts in line with holding warming to 1.5 degrees C, the Stocktake called on countries to act swiftly in areas that matter most for addressing the climate crisis — especially fossil fuels, renewables, transport and forests — and to do more to build resilience to climate impacts.</p><p>2025 NDCs are also an <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/aligning-ndcs-15degc-net-zero-and-lt-leds\">opportunity to align</a> near-term climate action with longer-term goals. Over <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker\">100 countries</a> have already pledged to reach <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/net-zero-ghg-emissions-questions-answered\">net-zero emissions</a>, most by around mid-century. Their new NDCs should chart a course toward achieving this.</p><h3>How Many Countries Have Submitted New NDCs? </h3><p>Under the Paris Agreement's timeline, 2025 NDCs were technically due in February. As of late May, only a <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">small proportion</a> of countries had submitted them, covering around a quarter of global emissions.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23444755/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These early movers include a diverse mix of developed and developing nations from different regions and economic backgrounds.</p><p>Among the G20 — the world's largest GHG emitters — only five countries submitted new NDCs so far: <strong>Canada</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong>, the<strong> United States</strong> and the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. (Since submitting its NDC, the U.S. announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.)</p><p>Several smaller and highly climate-vulnerable countries have also stepped forward, including <strong>Ecuador</strong> and <strong>Uruguay</strong> in Latin America;<strong> Kenya</strong>, <strong>Zambia</strong> and <strong>Zimbabwe </strong>in Africa; and island states such as <strong>Singapore</strong>, the <strong>Marshall Islands</strong> and the <strong>Maldives</strong>.</p><p>That means close to <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">90% of countries</a> have yet to submit their new NDCs.</p><p>There are several reasons for this. The last round of NDCs was pushed back by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, giving countries only four years to prepare new plans. Geopolitical tensions, ongoing conflicts and security concerns have further complicated progress. Many smaller developing nations are also facing capacity constraints as they work to complete biennial climate progress reports and new national adaptation plans (NAPs), also due this year.</p><p>Most countries <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/ten-years-since-the-paris-agreement-how-far-we-have-come-the-journey-ahead-un-climate-chief-delivers\">are now expected</a> to present their new NDCs by the UN General Assembly in September.</p><h3>How Much Have New NDCs Reduced the Emissions Gap?</h3><p>Compared to previous targets, the NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 \"emissions gap\": the difference between where emissions need to be in 2035 to align with 1.5 degrees C and where they're expected to be under countries' new climate plans.</p><p>If fully implemented, new NDCs are projected to reduce emissions by 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 when compared to 2030. Looking only at unconditional NDCs (those that don't require international support), this leaves a remaining emissions gap of 29.5 GtCO2e to hold warming to 1.5 degrees C. When conditional NDCs (those that do require international support) are included, this gap shrinks to 26.1 GtCO2e.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3138478/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Much of the progress in narrowing the gap comes from major emitters that have already submitted new NDCs — most notably the U.S., Japan and Brazil. Given their large emissions profiles, their new commitments account for the majority of the reductions seen so far.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Explore the NDC Tracker</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Use the <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">NDC tracker</a> on Climate Watch to monitor new NDC submissions as they come in and see how much they could reduce emissions if fully achieved.</p></div><p><strong>While this marks progress, it's far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits.</strong> Getting on track to 1.5 or even 2 degrees C would require much steeper cuts than what's currently on the table.</p><p>However, this is not the full picture.</p><p>Many of the world's largest emitters have yet to submit their 2035 targets. The remaining G20 countries alone account for about two-thirds of global GHG emissions. This makes their forthcoming NDCs especially important: The scale and ambition of these commitments could meaningfully narrow the emissions gap — or, if they fall short, leave the world locked into a trajectory that puts global temperature targets out of reach.</p><h4>Emissions-reduction targets put forward by major emitters so far:</h4><table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th>Country​</th><th>Reference Year​</th><th>Previous 2030 Emissions-Reduction Target​</th><th>New 2035 Emissions-Reduction Targets​</th><th>Net-Zero Target Year​</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Brazil​</td><td>2005​</td><td>53.1%​</td><td>59%-67%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>Canada​</td><td>2005​</td><td>40%-45%​</td><td>45%-50%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>Japan​</td><td>2013​</td><td>46%​</td><td>60%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom​</td><td>1990​</td><td>68%​</td><td>81%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2005​</td><td>50%-52%​</td><td>61%-66%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>How Do Specific Countries' Climate Plans Stack Up?</h3><p>Among the countries that have submitted new NDCs so far, the <strong>United Kingdom </strong>stands out for its ambitious climate trajectory. Following the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/2024/10/26/ccc-advises-81-reduction-in-emissions-by-2035/\">recommendations</a> of its Climate Change Committee, the U.K. has set a bold target to reduce emissions 81% by 2035 from 1990 levels. This rapid decline in the coming decade would put the country on track toward its net zero goal by 2050, <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-advice-on-the-uks-2035-nationally-determined-contribution-ndc/\">based on</a> realistic rates of technology deployment and ambitious but achievable shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p><p>Other countries, such as <strong>Japan</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong>, have opted for a \"linear\" approach toward net zero — meaning if they drew a straight line to their net-zero target (for example, 0 GtCO2e in 2050), their 2030 and 2035 targets would fall along it, reflecting a constant decline in emissions each year. Japan aims to cut emissions 60% from 2013 levels by 2035, while the United States has pledged a 61%-66% reduction from 2005 levels by 2035.</p><p>Despite the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, undermining climate policies and attempting to dismantle key government institutions, its NDC target may still provide a framework for climate action at the state, city and local levels, as well as for future administrations. Many of these entities have <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/press-releases/alliance-2035-target-dec-2024/?ref=csofutures.com\">already</a> rallied around the new NDC and are committed to making progress toward its targets.</p><p>However, the linear approach Japan and the U.S. are taking to emissions reductions — as opposed to a steeper decline this decade — risks using up a larger share of the world's carbon budget earlier and compromising global temperature targets.</p><p><strong>Brazil </strong>presented a broader range of emissions targets in its NDC, committing to a 59%-67% reduction by 2035 from 2005 levels. These two poles represent a marked difference in ambition: A 67% reduction could put Brazil on track for climate neutrality by 2050, while a 59% reduction falls short of what's needed to meet that goal. It is unclear which trajectory the government intends to pursue, leaving Brazil's true ambition in question. The NDC also omits carbon budgets for specific sectors (such as energy, transport or agriculture), which would clarify how it plans to meet its overarching emissions goals. However, Brazil committed <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2024-11/Brazil_Second%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20%28NDC%29_November2024.pdf\">within its NDC</a> to develop further plans outlining how each sector will contribute to its 2035 target.</p><p>Elsewhere, <strong>Canada</strong> made only a marginal increase to its target, shifting from a 40%-45% emissions reduction by 2030 to 45%-50% by 2035 from 2005 levels. This falls short of the <a href=\"https://www.nzab2050.ca/news-insights/net-zero-advisory-body-responds-to-todays-announcement-of-canadas-greenhouse-gas-emissions-target-for-2035\">recommendation</a> from Canada's own Net-Zero Advisory Body, which called for a 50%-55% reduction by 2035 — and warned that anything below 50% risks derailing progress toward the country's legislated net-zero goal by 2050. While every increase in ambition counts, such incremental changes do not match the urgent pace of progress needed among developed and wealthy economies like Canada.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23486838/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">Related</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">What Would Ambitious Climate Commitments Look Like for the World's Top Emitters?</a></li></ul></div><h3>What Trends Are Emerging Among NDCs Submitted So Far?</h3><p>Several early trends are starting to emerge among the new NDCs. While these initial submissions offer valuable insights, they don't yet reflect the full picture; deeper analysis will be needed as more NDCs come in throughout the year.</p><h4>1) Nearly all new NDCs include 2035 mitigation measures, with many setting economy-wide emissions-reduction targets.</h4><p>Almost all of the 22 NDCs submitted thus far include 2035 mitigation measures. The exception is <strong>Zambia</strong>, which reiterated its previous 2030 pledges in a provisional NDC (although this may still be revised to include 2035 mitigation measures).</p><p>Of the other 21 submissions, 20 countries expressed their 2035 targets as emissions-reduction goals. The exception was <strong>Cuba</strong>, which instead committed to increasing renewable electricity generation to 26% and improving energy efficiency by 2035.</p><p>Seventeen of the 20 countries with emissions-reduction goals set economy-wide reduction targets for 2035, as encouraged by the Global Stocktake, covering all sectors and greenhouse gases. The remaining few — smaller developing countries such as the <strong>Maldives</strong> and <strong>Nepal </strong>— submitted targets that cover only specific sectors or gases.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries are required to submit economy-wide targets, while developing countries are encouraged to work toward them over time. In Nepal's case, for instance, a lack of comprehensive data limited its ability to define an economy-wide target or fully assess the impact of its policies.</p><h4>2) Most countries did not strengthen their 2030 targets.</h4><p>Despite clear scientific evidence and UN decisions urging stronger 2030 targets, only four countries — <strong>Saint Lucia</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Moldova </strong>and <strong>Montenegro</strong> — have strengthened their 2030 emissions pledges. For example, Montenegro revised its emissions-reduction target from 35% to 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and set a 60% emissions-reduction target by 2035. </p><p>Notably, none of the wealthier, high-emitting and more developed countries have strengthened their 2030 targets — despite having the greatest capacity and responsibility to take the lead on slashing emissions.</p><h4>3) Countries are increasingly prioritizing adaptation.</h4><p>In the face of worsening climate impacts, 16 of the 22 countries that have submitted new NDCs strengthened their adaptation commitments — continuing a trend seen in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/state-nationally-determined-contributions-2022\">previous rounds</a>. Countries are prioritizing adaptation across sectors such as food and water systems, public health and nature-based solutions.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Firefighters putting out flames along a highway.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/canaad-fire-fighters_0.jpg?VersionId=oDsXmUNOUA7kTI8Zc.sWJ1cA5GyZ_rB1&itok=KlqXVuzm\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Canadian firefighters in 2021.

Some developed countries are also prioritizing adaptation action in their NDCs. <strong>Canada</strong>, which has witnessed devastating wildfires in recent years, cited its National Adaptation Strategy, which provides a framework for disaster resilience, biodiversity, public health and infrastructure.</p><h4>4) Countries are recognizing the importance of subnational action.</h4><p>Some countries' NDCs also recognize the critical role that subnational actors — such as cities, states and regions — play in shaping and delivering climate action.</p><p>Eleven of the newly submitted NDCs come from countries that have endorsed the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP)</a>. The CHAMP initiative — launched in 2023 by the COP28 Presidency, in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies and with the support of WRI and other partners — aims to strengthen collaboration between national and subnational governments on climate planning and implementation. As part of this commitment, 75 countries pledged to consult with and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/stronger-ndcs-cities-states-regions-recommendations-national-governments\">integrate</a> subnational priorities and needs into their NDCs. Of the 11 endorsing countries that have submitted new NDCs, four explicitly mentioned CHAMP.</p><p><strong>Brazil's </strong>NDC in particular recognizes the critical role subnational governments play in delivering national climate goals. Referred to as \"climate federalism,\" it highlights an instrument designed to support the integration of climate action into planning and decision-making across all levels of government: federal, state and municipal.</p><h3>How Are Countries Addressing Key Areas like Energy, Forestry and Transport?</h3><p>As countries submit new NDCs for the first time since the Global Stocktake in 2023, a clearer picture is emerging of how governments are embedding sector-specific action into their new climate plans. From detailed emissions-reduction targets to broader policy frameworks, most NDCs are setting out concrete steps to cut emissions across sectors that largely drive climate change, such as energy, transport and forestry.</p><p>Some countries — such as <strong>Switzerland</strong>, the <strong>UAE</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong> and <strong>Zimbabwe</strong> — have included sector-specific emissions-reduction targets directly in their NDCs. Switzerland's targets, for instance are aligned with its Climate and Innovation Act, with plans to cut emissions by 66% in buildings, 41% in transport and 42.5% in industry by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. Kenya, on the other hand, has set an ambitious target to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation in the national grid by 2035.</p><p>Others, like the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Singapore</strong>, the <strong>Marshall Islands </strong>and <strong>Canada</strong>, have focused on elaborating national policies and strategies that respond to the Global Stocktake's priority areas. The U.K.'s NDC highlighted its Clean Power 2030 Action Plan to fully decarbonize electricity by 2030; the Warm Homes Plan to boost energy efficiency in residential buildings; and reaffirmed its plans for phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1189\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"951\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"728\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"574\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"343\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cyclists on a closed-off city street to allow for biking and walking.\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/brazil-sao-paulo-cyclists.jpg?VersionId=foGuCuISvtbdA3gTGD_qkoedW3FFd7M5&itok=F-sOdcK-\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, Brazil, is car-free on Sundays to allow for more pedestrians and cyclists. Brazil has promised to submit new sectoral plans laying out what it will do in specific areas, like transport, to meet its broader climate goals. Photo by William Rodrigues dos Santos/Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Countries such as <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>New Zealand</strong> have committed to developing detailed sectoral strategies as a next step to support NDC implementation. Brazil plans to update its national climate strategy by mid-2025, breaking it down into 16 sectoral adaptation plans and seven mitigation plans. New Zealand committed to publishing its emissions-reduction plan for 2031-2035 in 2029, which will set out sectoral mitigation strategies to help deliver on its NDC.</p><p>As more countries prepare to submit their new NDCs, attention will focus on whether they follow the trend of outlining sector-specific actions to meet their broader emissions targets. In particular, the spotlight will be on how countries plan to contribute to the transition away from fossil fuels — the single largest driver of the climate crisis.</p><div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">Related</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/ndcs/sectoral-opportunities\">Learn More About How Countries Can Incorporate Sectoral Targets into NDCs</a></li></ul></div><h3>Looking Ahead, All Eyes Are on 3 Major Emitters</h3><p>We have yet to see new NDCs from many major emitters, including the European Union, China and India. All three have demonstrated climate leadership in various ways, and their actions will set the tone for future climate efforts. While these three are in the spotlight, attention will also be on other key countries — such as Indonesia, Mexico and Australia -— that are critical to reducing the global emissions gap.</p><h4>European Union</h4><p>The EU is still working to set a 2035 emissions target for <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters#:~:text=limit%20within%20reach.-,European%20Union,-Submitted%20in%202023\">its new NDC</a>, which will hinge on its longer-term 2040 target. Last year, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_588\">recommended</a> cutting emissions 90% by 2040 — a move that's seen as <a href=\"https://strategicperspectives.eu/eu-2040-climate-target-a-strong-economic-and-security-case-for-the-net-zero-transition/\">beneficial</a> for enhancing industrial competitiveness in clean technologies, strengthening energy security and cutting energy costs. Some EU member states have <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-all-but-guaranteed-to-miss-global-deadline-for-climate-targets/\">suggested</a> following a linear trajectory between the 2030 and 2040 targets, which would imply a 72.5% reduction by 2035 if the 90% target for 2040 gets adopted.</p><p>However, European member states have yet to adopt the 90% target. Ongoing discussions could see the EU's target <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-exploring-weaker-2040-climate-goal-90-greenhouse-gas-cut-wopke-hoekstra/\">weakened</a> to address concerns from heavy industry and agriculture. The delay in finalizing the EU's 2040 target is also putting its NDC timeline at risk, raising the possibility of missing the expected September submission date.</p><h4>China</h4><p>As the world's largest emitter, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters#:~:text=help%20guide%20implementation.-,China,-China%20overtook%20the\">China's NDC</a> will be critical to keeping global temperature goals within reach. The country has already made major strides in clean energy, leading the world in solar power and electric vehicle deployment. However, a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/lessons-for-coal-plant-cancellation#:~:text=3%20Countries%20to%20Watch%20for%20Coal%20Development\">surge in coal plant approvals</a> post-pandemic has raised concerns about its path toward net zero by 2060.</p><p>China's 2035 emission target will be the first in a post-peak emissions context. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">Studies</a> aligned with 1.5 degrees C and China's net-zero pledge suggest the need for sharper cuts by 2030 and continued deep reductions through 2035. In this context, <a href=\"https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/charting-chinas-path-its-2035-nationally-determined-contribution\">some</a> <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/chinas-clean-energy-trends-could-cut-emissions-by-30-in-2035-if-sustained/\">research</a> suggests that China could reduce CO2 emissions 30% by 2035 (compared to 2020) on the way to achieve its net zero target by 2060.</p><p>President Xi Jinping <a href=\"https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202504/content_7020623.htm\">announced</a> in April that China will submit its updated NDC ahead of the UN climate summit (COP30) this November, covering <em>all</em> sectors and greenhouse gases. This marks a notable shift for the country: Its previous NDCs covered only CO2, but China's non-CO2 emissions alone place it among the world's top 10 emitters.</p><h4>India</h4><p>Unlike other major economies, India has some of the lowest <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/charts-explain-per-capita-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">per capita emissions</a>, and its national emissions are still growing as the country works to eradicate poverty and achieve development goals. This means its emissions are not expected to decline by 2035, though some <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">studies</a> suggest earlier declines are needed. Rapid advances in renewable energy and clean technology offer a significant opportunity for the country to accelerate its low-carbon transition while also ensuring energy security and economic competitiveness.</p><p>Strengthening renewable energy commitments in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters#:~:text=degrees%20C%20future.-,India,-India%E2%80%99s%20GHG%20emissions\">India's next NDC</a> — building upon its domestic target of 500 GW by 2030 — could chart a pathway for sustainable growth, while also delivering co-benefits like cleaner air and enhanced energy security.</p><h3>What's Next for NDCs?</h3><p>The UN climate change body (UNFCCC) will release an NDC synthesis report ahead of this year's COP30 climate summit, assessing the collective impact of the new pledges submitted to that point. While this report will solidify where we're headed in relation to the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, the storyline is already clear:<strong> New NDCs will not put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C.</strong></p><p>The emissions gap is likely to remain dangerously wide, and the report will reaffirm what we already know — that much greater ambition and action are needed. Still, the findings will serve as a key input for this year's climate conference, where countries will decide on next steps to narrow that gap. They must address what comes after NDCs, grappling with how to turn ambition into action and keep a safer future within reach.</p><p>Ultimately, putting forward strong plans — and fulfilling them — are essential levers: not only for limiting warming, but for safeguarding the health, prosperity and security of current and future generations.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: A correction was made on June 3, 2025 to reflect an update in the underlying data. New conditional NDCs are estimated to reduce emissions by 1.4 GtCO2e by 2035 rather than 1.5 GtCO2e.</em></p>",
