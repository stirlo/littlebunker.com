      "description": "<p>AI tools like ChatGPT, navigation apps and streaming platforms feel effortless, drawing information seemingly from thin air. Yet the infrastructure behind them is anything but invisible.</p><p>Across the country, a surge of new data centers is reshaping local energy grids, water systems and land use. This rapid expansion is often happening with limited public information about the long-term impacts — or benefits — new data centers could bring.</p><p>Rising power bills and rampant water use tend to be top of mind. Yet it’s increasingly clear that data centers will have impacts far beyond this, with real implications for communities’ well-being.</p><p>While the rise in data centers is all but inevitable, the <em>way</em> it happens is not. Data centers power modern life and can bring both investment and jobs. Clear rules on energy procurement, water use, land siting, community engagement and cost recovery will determine whether this growth strengthens local economies and infrastructure — or shifts risks to residents.</p><h3>The US Data Center Boom</h3><p>Data centers are the physical infrastructure of the internet. They house the servers, networking equipment and supporting systems — such as cooling, power backup, fire suppression and security — that keep digital services running reliably.</p><p>Data centers first emerged in the mid-20th century and proliferated during the 1990s alongside the rise of the internet. But today’s expansion is unfolding at a much larger scale and faster pace than ever before. It’s fueled by billions of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\">private investment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.naiop.org/research-and-publications/magazine/2024/Winter-2024-2025/development-ownership/an-overview-of-state-data-center-related-tax-incentives/\">state tax incentives</a>, and federal directives aimed at <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\">fast-tracking permitting</a>. These policies are prioritizing large, AI-related facilities in a bid to strengthen <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\">U.S. competitiveness</a>.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27513048/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These facilities can take many forms, ranging from small server rooms inside of office buildings to massive, stand-alone <a>campuses</a> the size of hundreds of football fields. This last category, often known as “hyperscale” data centers, has drawn particular attention thanks to their size, rapid growth and substantial impacts on local communities.</p><p>There were just over <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/\">3,900</a> data centers across the United States as of late January<sup>1</sup> — nearly 37% of the world’s total. Yet market trends <a href=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5527026/u-s-data-center-market-landscape-2025-2030#rela0-5562649\">suggest</a> that hyperscale development is highly concentrated in just a few regions. These areas function as national hubs for cloud and AI infrastructure, hosting a disproportionate share of large-scale facilities relative to their size.</p><p>Virginia, often described as “<a href=\"https://www.governing.com/infrastructure/the-data-center-capital-of-the-world-is-in-virginia#:~:text=Northern%20Virginia%20is%20the%20world%27s%20top%20data,cable%20and%20energy%20infrastructure%20by%20America%20Online**\">the data center capital of the world</a>,” hosts the largest number of facilities, followed by Texas and California. Together, the top 10 states account for roughly 60% of all data centers nationwide.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27396716/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>How Data Centers Affect Communities — and How Governments Are Responding</h3><p>As data centers multiply across the country, so do their impacts. We examined seven ways this growth is reshaping local conditions ― and looked at emerging governance practices that can help manage trade-offs.</p><h4>1) Managing soaring energy demand</h4><p>As technology advances and computing demand grows, data centers are becoming <a>increasingly energy</a> hungry. A single modern AI data center can use as much power as <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/executive-summary\">100,000 homes</a>; many of the larger ones now being built are expected to consume up to 20 times that amount.</p><p>Estimates of total future power demand from data centers <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">vary</a> significantly. One study from the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.71468/P1WC7Q\">Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> found that data centers could represent up to 12% of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. Another analysis, by <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies-National-Load-Growth-Report-2025.pdf\">Grid Strategies</a>, says that up to 90 gigawatts (GW) worth of data centers could come online by 2030. That’s about 9 times New York City’s peak summer demand joining the grid in less than five years.</p><p>This adds to concerns about rising power bills across the United States. 2025 saw <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/electric-and-natural-gas-utility-rate-hikes-tracker/\">over $60 billion</a> worth of rate increases countrywide, with Americans paying almost 10% more for electricity on average compared to 2024. The reasons for these rate hikes are complex and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=michelle+levinson+elecgricity+prices&oq=michelle+levinson+&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIAhBFGDsyCggAEEUYFhgeGDsyCwgBEOkHGPQHGM0IMgYIAhBFGDsyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyCAgGEAAYFhgeMggIBxAAGBYYHjIGCAgQRRg8MggICRDpBxjyBzIICAoQ6QcY8gcyCAgLEOkHGPIHMggIDBDpBxj8VdIBCDUxMzJqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">variable</a>. However, there’s evidence that the need to <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/data-centers-pjm-capacity-auction/808951/\">procure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-data-center-transmission-costs-ratepayers/761579/\">build</a> new energy infrastructure for data centers contributed to price increases in at least one region (the Mid-Atlantic). Other regions could see the same if safeguards aren’t put in place.</p><p>Many states and utilities are exploring ways to ensure that data centers can come online without shifting costs to other ratepayers. Last year, utility <a href=\"https://www.aep.com/news/stories/view/10327/\">AEP Ohio</a> introduced a new rate schedule for data centers requiring them to pay for at least 85% of the energy they are subscribed for, regardless of how much they actually use. Other states, like <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/06/05/oregon-data-centers-cryptocurrency-business-environment-power-electricity/\">Oregon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/94/2025/1/HF/16/versions/0/\">Minnesota</a> and <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/25info/bts_web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=66\">Missouri</a>, have required utilities to create new billing classes and rate structures for large energy users so that their costs aren’t shared by households and businesses.</p><h4>2) Protecting local water supplies</h4><p>Data centers require huge amounts of water to keep servers cool enough to function. Mid-sized facilities can use up to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119938708/data-centers-backbone-of-the-digital-economy-face-water-scarcity-and-climate-ris\">300,000 gallons</a> of water a day, while large facilities can consume as much as <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption\">5 million gallons</a> daily — comparable to what a small town uses. Recent <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2026/01/11/americas-ai-boom-is-running-into-an-unplanned-water-problem/\">estimates</a> project that by 2028, AI-related data centers in the U.S. could require up to 32 <em>billion</em> gallons of water annually. This is enough to support roughly 360,000 households’ indoor water use.</p><p>This massive demand is a pressing problem for communities already facing drought or depleting water supplies. <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ai-data-center-growth-deepens-water-security-concerns-in-high-stress-states-report/\">Two-thirds</a> of all data centers built or in development since 2022 are located in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-data-centers-are-deepening-the-water-crisis-2025-6\">water-stressed areas</a> like southern Arizona, the Colorado River Basin and Texas.</p><p>This has prompted public concern and <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/google-agrees-to-limit-groundwater-use-from-s-c-aquifer/\">governance action</a> in some communities. In <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/google-agrees-to-limit-groundwater-use-from-s-c-aquifer/\">South Carolina</a>, for example, residents near an overdrawn aquifer sought limits on data center ground water withdrawals. Others are asserting greater oversight through water-use monitoring, drought contingency planning, and site-specific water risk assessments that evaluate impacts on local water supplies. Some data centers are using cooling approaches that reduce water demand, such as traditional <a href=\"https://www.iceotope.com/learning-hub/insights/an-introduction-to-data-center-cooling/\">air cooling or liquid immersion</a>. Others are leveraging <a href=\"https://esgnews.com/aws-expands-recycled-water-use-to-over-120-data-centers-across-the-u-s/#:~:text=Recycled%20Water%20and%20Data%20Infrastructure,model%20of%20circular%20resource%20use.\">reclaimed wastewater</a> from utilities instead of drawing from local supplies.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1044\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"835\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"640\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"504\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"302\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A large data center under construction.\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/mesa-data-center_0.jpg?VersionId=tp6ubmpk58HEpjiuqIY_NFIvtayS.dpC&itok=gWlBQiV-\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Mesa Data Center near Phoenix, Ariz. Two-thirds of U.S. data centers built or in development since 2022 are in water-stressed areas.

Many facilities rely on gas-fired generation for routine operations alongside diesel generators for emergency backup. Both come with climate and health risks.</p><p>Some data centers house gas power on-site for day-to-day operations, creating continuous air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most visible examples is unfolding in Memphis, Tennessee, where more than 30 natural gas turbines intended for daily use are being installed at xAI’s new Colossus data center. Local residents and the NAACP filed a notice with <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/naacp-launches-lawsuit-over-pollution-from-musks-xai/\">intent to sue</a> under the Clean Air Act, arguing that the project could <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/elon-musks-xai-facility-is-polluting-south-memphis/\">worsen already dangerous air quality </a>in a city that faces high asthma rates and longstanding environmental health disparities.</p><p>Diesel-fueled backup generators also release harmful air pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), linked to respiratory disease, heart disease, asthma and other serious health risks. Although these generators are <a href=\"https://www.sidley.com/en/insights/newsupdates/2025/05/us-epa-issues-new-guidance-on-data-center-emergency-generator-operations\">only used during emergencies</a>, they can have outsized health impacts, emitting <a href=\"https://www.aqmd.gov/home/permits/emergency-generators\">200 to 600 times</a> more nitrogen oxides than natural gas plants. One analysis in Virginia estimated that even limited backup generator use could already be associated with nearly <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2412.06288v2#A1.SS1\">$300 million in annual public health</a> costs and 14,000 asthma-related health impacts across multiple states.</p><p>Some facilities are beginning to adopt cleaner on-site power alternatives. <a href=\"https://dcpulse.com/article/battery-energy-storage-data-centers#:~:text=Most%20BESS%20use%20lithium%2Dion,no%20emissions%20when%20in%20use.\">Battery energy storage systems</a> can replace diesel generators during outages, avoiding their high pollution. Pairing hybrid <a href=\"https://www.7x24exchange.org/a-transformative-approach-to-bridging-the-data-center-power-gap/\">microgrids</a> with renewables is another alternative that supports community resilience without increasing emissions. Local and state officials can help by integrating clean power and emissions considerations into permitting and comprehensive planning; requiring companies to disclose on-site power strategies; and evaluating cleaner alternatives during permitting review.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Aerial view of a large data center campus with power generation on site.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/skybox-power-campus_0.jpg?VersionId=eqNI.P3t4tN8TKEJIn9JmiP5mMs_CMOp&h=ce783091&itok=4qQ74zBP\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Some data center campuses, like the Skybox Power Campus near Austin, Texas, are being built with power infrastructure onsite. Photo by Steve Heap/Shutterstock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>4) Mitigating noise</h4><p>Data center construction, rooftop cooling systems and backup generators can be disruptively noisy. Smaller diesel generators reportedly <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Understanding-the-impact-of-data-center-noise-pollution#:~:text=Noise%20emission%20depends%20on%20the,Cooling%20systems\">reach 85 decibels</a>, levels that can harm hearing. Larger industrial units can approach 100 decibels — equivalent to a motorcycle or jackhammer.</p><p>This noise can last for hours or days at a time. Residents in Loudon County, Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/data-center-noise-disruptions-loudoun-county-virginia-2023-11?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=insider-Virginia-sub-post\">reported</a> disruptions in sleep, headaches and even lower quality of life because of a nearby data center, experiences that were echoed during a recent <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/the_data_center_next_door_the_hidden_costs_of_ai_and_crypto.pdf\">congressional roundtable</a>.</p><p>To address this, some data center developers and local governments are beginning to use measures such as natural acoustic <a href=\"https://future-bridge.us/noise-control-in-data-centers-key-design-strategies/\">barriers</a>, greater setbacks from homes and improved insulation for backup generators. Emerging technologies, including liquid cooling and improved airflow design, can also lower fan and HVAC noise. In places where <a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/data-centers\">zoning codes</a> include noise protections, local governments can use the permitting processes to require projected decibel levels, noise mitigation plans and ongoing monitoring commitments.</p><h4>5) Addressing competition for land</h4><p>Massive data centers are reshaping how land is used in many communities. In 2024, the <a href=\"https://cushwake.cld.bz/Data-Center-Development-Cost-Guide-2025/2-3/\">average data center site</a> covered about 224 acres or 0.35 square miles — roughly the size of 450 football fields. This represents a 144% increase since 2022. Developers are increasingly seeking large parcels for multi-building campuses that allow for phased construction and future expansion. Hyperscale facilities require even more land, with the largest campuses exceeding 1,000 acres, or about 1.6 square miles, according to a recent report from the <a href=\"https://wfbf.com/policy/current-issues/data-center-impacts-on-agriculture/\">Wisconsin Farm Bureau</a>.</p><p>This often intersects with agricultural and rural land uses. In Wisconsin, where about 50 data centers are located, <a href=\"https://www.wdtn.com/news/300-acres-of-farmland-could-be-rezoned-for-new-data-center-near-i-70/\">residents have concerns</a> that rezoning for data center development could accelerate the loss of productive farmland, which is already declining due to development pressures, land consolidation and competition. Similar tensions have surfaced across rural communities in Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.inkfreenews.com/2025/05/05/data-center-wave-stalls-as-indiana-communities-push-back/?ref=ambrook\">Indiana </a>and <a href=\"https://appvoices.org/2025/07/09/community-defeats-gas-plant-and-data-center-proposal/\">Virginia</a>. In Ohio, a proposal to rezone 300 acres of farmland to support data center development sparked such widespread opposition that the landowners ultimately <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/application-for-data-center-in-preble-county-ohio-withdrawn/\">withdrew their application</a>.</p><p>Some local governments are exploring policies to treat data centers as a distinct land use, steer development away from prime farmland and apply additional reviews to large-scale projects. These approaches can include strengthened agricultural zoning and implementing performance standards to address buffering, traffic, noise and long-term site management.</p><h4>6) Reducing pressure on marginalized communities</h4><p>Emerging analyses suggest that some data center siting patterns could compound long-standing environmental and economic challenges. A national <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/environmental-justice-us-data-centers-key-insights-equitable-kmetz-326vf/\">review </a>of roughly 700 data centers across the country found that nearly half are in census tracts with above-median environmental burdens, such as air pollution, park access and water pollution, as measured by the Center for Disease Control’s Environmental Justice Index. Many were located in areas with social vulnerability indicators, such as poverty and lower education levels.</p><p>State level assessments show similar concerns. In <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/data-center-boom-risks-health-of-already-vulnerable-communities/\">California</a>, existing and planned data centers appear more frequently in areas of high air pollution. In <a href=\"https://capitalbnews.org/ai-data-centers-south-carolina-black-communities/\">South Carolina</a>, new facilities and the fossil-fuel generation built to power them are often sited near Black and low-income communities.</p><p>More research is needed to fully understand these trends. Yet preliminary findings underscore the importance of ensuring that new data center development does not reinforce existing inequities.</p><p>Several practices can help communities and local governments navigate the trade-offs of data center siting. The <a href=\"https://naacp.org/resources/frontline-framework-community-guiding-principles\">NAACP’s Frontline Framework Community Guiding Principles</a>, offers practical strategies to ensure data centers are planned and built in ways that protect health and equity. In addition, <a href=\"https://naacp.org/sites/default/files/documents/NAACP%20CBA%20Template%202026.pdf\">NAACP's Community Benefits Agreement template</a> helps communities and decision-makers advance transparency, accountability and shared governance in data center development.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Construction of data center near a neighborhood.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/data-center-construction-georgia_0.jpg?VersionId=QGL1n5k2fKgQ3DBiomWc5H3DpdCKYVLh&itok=aWYpvGes\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Construction of a data center near homes in Atlanta, Ga. Developers and governments need to plan data centers with care to ensure they do not put pressure on communities, especially those already facing environmental and social disparities.

Their construction generates hundreds of well-paying — though temporary — jobs for technicians, electricians and other local building trade workers. There are also good-paying opportunities for full-time staff, like technicians, security staff and facility managers. At Google’s data center in central Ohio, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-promised-jobs-cities-160333397.html\">salaries range from</a> about $74,000 for a data center technician to more than $160,000 for an operations manager. Yet these positions are fairly limited. A <a href=\"https://goodjobsfirst.org/big-tech-promised-jobs-cities-gave-millions-where-are-the-workers/\">review</a> of more than 1,200 U.S. data centers found that even the largest employ fewer than 150 permanent workers, and sometimes as few as 25.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Summary of Governance Tools to Mitigate Data Center Impacts on Communities</strong></p><p><strong>Energy</strong></p><ul><li>Dedicated rate classes for large energy users.</li><li>Cost-recovery safeguards.</li></ul><p><strong>Water Protection</strong></p><ul><li>Water-use monitoring and public disclosure.</li><li>Drought contingency planning.</li><li>Reclaimed wastewater use.</li></ul><p><strong>Air</strong></p><ul><li>Replacing diesel with battery storage.</li><li>Emissions review during permitting.</li><li>On-site clean power requirements.</li></ul><p><strong>Land-Use Planning</strong></p><ul><li>Agricultural zoning protections.</li><li>Performance standards for noise, traffic and buffering.</li></ul><p><strong>Equity and Community Voice</strong></p><ul><li>Community benefits agreements.</li><li>Transparent siting criteria.</li><li>Limiting use of NDAs.</li><li>Public disclosure of resource demands.</li></ul></div><p>Data centers also generate revenue for local or state governments through property, sales and use taxes. A recent <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63a4849eab1c756a1d3e97b1/t/67b38f78e9cf125daf756112/1739820925392/Data+Center+Economic+Contribution+Study+2025_Final.pdf\">national</a> estimate found that total government revenues associated with the data center sector increased from $66 billion in 2017 to more than $162 billion in 2023. However, many states and cities offer sizable tax incentives to attract data centers, meaning the actual gain can be far smaller than projected.</p><p>These benefits must be weighed against long-term public costs, including investments in water systems, electrical substations, transmission lines, roads and emergency services. Water and electric infrastructure often remains in place for around 30 years. If a data center downsizes or relocates before these costs are recovered, communities may be left paying for infrastructure sized for a facility that no longer exists.</p><p>Communities and local governments can call for stronger financial analysis, clear rules for cost recovery, and more transparency about infrastructure demands to help ensure that both host communities and companies see economic benefits from new data centers.</p><h3>Done Right, Data Centers Don’t Have to Be Harmful</h3><p>As data centers proliferate, local concerns are mounting. More than $64 billion in projects were delayed or canceled between May 2024 and March 2025 due to organized <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\">opposition</a>.</p><p>Threats to communities are not an inevitable outcome of data center development; they’re the result of decisions made by developers, local governments and other stakeholders. Yet even as community involvement grows, major governance gaps persist.</p><p>Many developers enter non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with local officials, which can limit public access to information about project scale, resource needs and potential impacts. A <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/30/data-centers-non-disclosure-agreements-and-democracy/\">review</a> of 31 Virginia municipalities with existing or proposed data centers found that 25 (80%) had NDAs in place. At the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\">federal level</a>, new permitting policies have accelerated approvals for large data center projects, shortening environmental review timelines and reducing opportunities for local input.</p><p>In response, some local governments are beginning to develop stronger tools to support negotiations with developers. Some local governments, like <a href=\"https://www.wosu.org/politics-government/2025-09-09/jerome-township-puts-pause-on-new-data-center-development-for-nine-months\">Jerome Township</a>, Ohio, have imposed temporary moratoria, pausing approvals for new data centers to reassess siting criteria and community safeguards. Prince George’s County, Md., created a <a href=\"https://pgccouncil.us/DocumentCenter/View/12947/Council-Resolution-16-2025\">data center task force</a> to study siting criteria and procedural protections. In Lancaster, Pa., city leaders approved a <a href=\"https://ecode360.com/LA1674/document/753204358.pdf\">community benefits agreement</a> which directs the developer to use clean energy to power the facility; mitigate noise; support local employment programs; and deliver $10 million each for economic development and advancing Lancaster climate and community goals.</p><p>Together, these efforts reflect an emerging understanding: <strong>How data centers are governed will determine whether communities benefit from the digital economy — or bear the brunt of its risks.</strong> Ultimately, whether data centers deliver shared prosperity or reinforce existing inequities will hinge on policies and processes that fully include community priorities alongside government and developer decision-making.</p><p><em>Research support for this article was provided by Jada Turner, a Park Scholar and Honors student at North Carolina State University.</em></p><p> </p><p><sup>1 Total U.S. data center count as of Jan. 21, 2026.

But they are far from insignificant. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-026-02558-4\">New maps of crop emissions</a> from a global collaboration of universities and international research institutions, led by Cornell University and <a href=\"https://landcarbonlab.org/\">Land & Carbon Lab</a>, reveal that in 2020 alone, croplands emitted nearly 5% of global net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by human activity. That may sound small, but these emissions surpass those from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modernizing-ports-major-untapped-opportunity-healthier-planet\">global shipping</a> and are on par with annual GHG emissions from <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">tropical primary forest loss</a>.</p><p>Just four crops — rice, maize (corn), wheat and oil palm — account for the majority (67%) of these emissions, even though hundreds of crops are grown worldwide. Emissions from these top-emitting crops come from the large areas of land they occupy and the way that land is managed, including the use of fertilizers, manure, burning leftover crops, and other cultivation techniques.</p><p>Clearly, these crops are essential to nourish a rising global population —  projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.unonline.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">nearly 10 billion people by 2050</a> —  as well as for the rapid increase in animal feed demand and for creating industrial products used in our everyday lives. At the same time, there is an opportunity to shape a more climate-smart, resource-efficient global food system, where farming plays a more significant role in addressing climate change.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A man rides a plow on farmland surrounded by white birds.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/rice-farmer-plow-sri-lanka_0.jpg?VersionId=12Pg0d7r06ZDeVi_Ou3AVp3WeTVrXMef&h=b2d9f031&itok=K06wYsKj\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>After harvest on a Sri Lanka rice field, a man plows the field.

When these soils dry out, the presence of oxygen triggers microbial activity that breaks down the organic matter, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide. In contrast, flooded rice fields release methane because waterlogged soils lack oxygen, creating ideal conditions for methane-producing microbes to break down organic matter.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Degraded peatlands after they've been cleared for agricultural production.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/degraded-peatlands-clearing_0.jpg?VersionId=lLQyXqUrC3UyYJQrjnn2nvZMT5E2u4Fg&itok=AcobW9kg\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>As peatlands are cleared and drained for agricultural production, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide.

Two farmers growing the same crop in the same region can have different emission footprints simply because they make different choices about fertilizer, water and soil management. This variation shows that one-size-fits-all climate solutions are unlikely to be effective. Instead, reducing emissions from agriculture requires targeted, context-specific approaches that reflect local crops, conditions and farming practices.</p><div class=\"callout aligncenter\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Data: A Clearer Map for Climate-Smart Agriculture</strong></p><p>To map global cropland emissions, a consortium of leading research institutions led by Cornell University along with Colorado State University, University of Minnesota, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and others combined a wide range of ground-based and modeled data sources to harmonize crop and livestock production systems.</p><p>Croplands are defined according to FAO as land used to grow temporary (crops with a growing cycle of less than one year that need to be replanted after harvest) and permanent (long-lived) crops and exclude temporary grazing lands and fallow lands (previously cropped fields left unseeded for one or more seasons to let the soil recover).</p><p>To map which crops are grown where, how much is harvested and how many calories are produced, the team used the <a href=\"https://www.mapspam.info/\">Spatial Production Allocation Model</a>. Then, they layered in spatially detailed information about how crops are typically managed, drawing from FAO, national reports and scientific literature.</p><p>Peatland extent was defined using a hybrid map adjusted to align with cropland totals on drained peatlands as reported in the <a href=\"https://globalpeatlands.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/peatland_assessment.pdf\">Global Peatland Assessment</a>. Then, emissions were mapped using methods from <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html\">IPCC’s 2019 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</a>.</p><p>Note that maps of crop emissions do not account for changes in agricultural soil carbon beyond carbon dioxide emissions from crops growing on drained peatlands. The maps also exclude carbon dioxide temporarily stored and released from the crops themselves.</p></div><h3>The 4 Crops Driving 67% of Emissions</h3><p>The biggest opportunity for cutting emissions lies in focusing on how rice, maize, wheat and oil palm are grown. These crops are essential to feed and nourish the world, yet it will be just as essential to rethink how these crops are grown to cut climate pollution and ensure farmers can still earn a living.</p><p>Rice accounts for 43% of all cropland emissions globally. This is due primarily to methane emissions from flooded rice fields, a process central to traditional rice farming in much of Asia.</p><p>Maize and wheat, though less emissions-intensive than rice per hectare, cover vast areas of the globe and rely heavily on nitrogen fertilizers to grow quickly and sustain high yields, leading to high total nitrous oxide emissions.</p><p>Oil palm, though planted on just 2% of cropland, packs a huge climate punch because it’s often grown on carbon-rich peatlands in Southeast Asia.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26907727/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>6 Countries Account for 61% of all Crop Emissions</h3><p>The six highest-emitting countries — China, Indonesia, India, United States, Thailand and Brazil — together account for 61% of global crop emissions. China, Indonesia, India and Thailand are also among the world’s leading rice producers — a key food staple for billions of people every day — which largely explains their high emissions profiles.</p><p>Emissions in other top-emitting countries like Brazil and the U.S. are driven more by fertilizer use than growing rice. Indonesia stands out for its high emissions from planting crops on drained peatlands</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26905117/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Where different crops are grown around the world today often reflect more than just climate or soil conditions — it’s also the result of deep-rooted historical legacies. Colonial trade routes, government subsidies, dietary preferences and infrastructure investments have all shaped agricultural landscapes over time. For example, oil palm dominates parts of Southeast Asia not only because it grows well there, but also due to decades of <a href=\"https://www.un-redd.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/INDONESIA%20FISCAL%20POLICIES%20OIL%20PALM%20V6%20WEB.pdf\">government incentives</a>, <a href=\"https://gfw.global/xHJbi7\">processing infrastructure</a> and <a href=\"https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Indonesia_Palm_Oil_Fact_Sheet_20190130.pdf\">export demand</a>. Likewise, wheat and maize that grow in temperate countries reflects <a href=\"https://aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/World-Agricultural-Crop-Production-over-the-Past-Six-Decades.pdf\">public and private investment</a> in breeding higher-yielding seeds, expanding <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2024-05-20_R48071_c6388b51e55f3414934d8f621905bd952ed19937.pdf\">rural extension programs</a> and building <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/corn-is-everywhere/\">commodity markets</a> and trade networks. These patterns persist, even when more climate-smart or resource-efficient alternatives may be available. Understanding these legacies is key to recognizing both the constraints and opportunities for shifting to lower emission, more sustainable cropping systems.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Smoke from burning crop residues in agricultural farmland lifts into the air.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/burning-crop-residues_0.jpg?VersionId=pyu03GM4gCAsI0GE403Z_UvHdYjgCTTh&h=5a62e6c6&itok=DcmpY_fy\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The practice of burning crop residues after harvest releases harmful climate emissions including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide into the air.

Here, calories refer to the energy contained in harvested crops, a standard way to compare very different crops on equal footing, whether they’re used for food, animal feed, biofuels or other products. Together, these metrics help us understand not just how much we are emitting, but also how many emissions arise per unit of energy contained in those crops. It’s a bit like looking at how much pollution your car produces overall and how much it emits for every mile you drive. Just as understanding fuel efficiency helps set smarter standards for cars and trucks, this level of detail helps design smarter, more targeted climate solutions for agriculture.   </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26902867/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>High emissions don’t always mean a system is inefficient. Some of the most productive farming regions in the world also have the highest emissions. Asia, for example, has the highest emissions per hectare of cropland, but also produces a large share of the world’s calories. Regions like Sub-Saharan Africa have much lower emissions per hectare, mainly because farmers use fewer fertilizers and other inputs and get lower yields. Each hectare emits less, but it also produces fewer calories. As a result, emissions per hectare look small, yet emissions per calorie aren’t proportionally low, since more land is needed to produce the same amount of food. The same pattern shows up when evaluating individual crops: Rice produces nearly half of all crop emissions globally but also delivers 28% of Asia’s calories. Oil palm, another top emitter, is also one of the most land-efficient crops in terms of calorie production.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26903653/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>This points to a core challenge in climate-smart agriculture: High emitting regions are often critical to food security. That doesn’t mean high emissions are justified, but it does mean that simply targeting the biggest emitters and setting blanket emission reduction targets could backfire. Instead, efforts should focus on reducing emissions per unit of crop calorie produced, getting the same (or more) output from each hectare while generating fewer emissions.</p><h3>Emissions Are Increasing in Key Crop-Producing Regions</h3><p>Emissions from crop production are not static — they are shaped by decades of decisions about where and how we grow food for human consumption, feed for livestock, fiber for industrial materials and biofuel for energy. Understanding these patterns is essential for designing effective, region-specific strategies to mitigate emissions.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2020, crop production increased 50% globally, corresponding to a 17% increase in emissions from croplands across major agricultural zones, especially in parts of Asia and South America. These changes reflect a combination of factors, including rising demand as well as shifts in how and where crops are cultivated — such as expanding crops into new areas, more intensive use of fertilizer and changing crop choices over time.</p><p>Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer and manure application together increased by 35%, with prominent increases in southern China, India, Indonesia and southern Brazil driven by intensified fertilizer use, increasing cropping intensity and the expansion of fertilizer-dependent crops into new areas.</p><p>Methane emissions from rice paddies remained relatively stable overall, but with regional shifts of declining emissions in some areas offset by increasing emissions in others, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. Emissions from crops planted on drained peatlands increased slightly in Southeast Asia, reflecting continued expansion of drainage infrastructure for cultivation of crops like oil palm. However, trends in other regions remain uncertain due to large differences in peatland and drained peatland estimates across datasets.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3576417/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>How to Feed a Growing Population While Reducing Emissions</h3><p>The issue boils down to one key question: How do we feed a projected 10 billion people by 2050 without driving up emissions?</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Using Research for Climate-Smart Food Systems</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">A full accounting of a company’s contribution to global land pressure includes metrics such as land use change emissions and land occupation (i.e., the amount of the land required to produce a crop). By combining Land & Carbon Lab’s spatially explicit data on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/companies-can-address-land-use-change-emissions-meet-climate-goals\">land use change emissions</a> and land occupation with these new maps of crop management emissions — with spatially detailed <a href=\"https://landcarbonlab.org/data/land-based-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sequestration/\">livestock emissions maps</a> coming later in 2026 — policymakers, producers and supply chain actors gain a far more complete and detailed picture of agriculture’s climate footprint. This integrated view enables more targeted, effective interventions to build a climate-smart, resource-efficient global food system that would simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and the pressure on the land itself.</p></div><p>This shouldn’t be a trade-off with climate action. The challenge is navigating the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore\">land squeeze</a>, where food production, industrial resources, biodiversity and carbon storage all compete for the same amount of land. The broad solution is to protect natural ecosystems, produce more food on existing agricultural land, reduce emissions and restore degraded land.</p><p>Simply swapping out high-emitting crops like rice isn’t the answer. Staple crops are deeply rooted in cultural, culinary, and agricultural traditions that can’t and shouldn’t be easily replaced; longstanding rice farming systems have sustained food security and livelihoods for centuries. Instead, the solution lies in <em>how </em>we grow crops.</p><p>Major sources of emissions from lands used to grow crops each need tailored strategies that farmers can implement, in some cases supported by incentives or pressures from governments and companies:</p><ul><li>For rice, climate impacts can be slashed through smarter water and residue management, like switching from constant flooding to alternate wetting and drying. Instead of burning or tilling leftover rice stalks, they can be used as animal bedding or feed or be composted after harvest. These methods can cut methane emissions nearly in half. However, adoption challenges may persist, like demand for human labor needed to weed intermittently flooded paddies and manually remove straw where mechanization is limited.</li><li>Fertilizer-related emissions can be lowered using the “4R” <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01076-w\">approach</a>, which refers to applying the right fertilizer source, at the right rate, at the right time, and in the right place. This means matching fertilizer type to crop needs (e.g., slow-release vs. fast-acting), avoiding over-application, timing application to when crops can actually absorb nutrients — typically during early to mid-growth stages when plants are rapidly growing — and placing fertilizer close to roots instead of broadcasting it across the field to improve uptake. These practices reduce the amount of excess nitrogen left in the soil, which microbes would otherwise convert into nitrous oxide emissions. Field trials show that good 4R management can cut nitrous oxide emissions by 20% to 50%.</li><li>For crops cultivated on peatlands, raising the water table even partway can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions. Rewetting peatlands — even partially — keeps more carbon in the ground by slowing decomposition without necessarily halting crop production.</li></ul><p>The future of agriculture will depend on how quickly we align past agricultural land use legacies with today’s planetary constraints.</p>",

The agency finalized a rule <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">overturning its own “endangerment finding”</a> — established after years of scientific analysis — that concluded that greenhouse gas pollution endangers human health and requires regulation.

By repealing this finding, the EPA removes the scientific and legal basis that requires federal regulation of greenhouse gases, weakening protections for people, the environment and the economy.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><table class=\"table table-style-align-center\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding: 0; width: 75px;\"><img alt=\"Profile photo.\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/2025-08/david-widawsky_0.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 100%; display: inline; width: 75px;\" /></td><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/david-widawsky\"><em><strong>David Widawsky</strong></em></a><em>, Director, WRI's U.S. Program</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/david-widawsky\"><strong>WRI U.S. Director and climate expert David Widawsky</strong></a> breaks down what is at stake for U.S. households, why this deregulation could increase legal risks for businesses and what comes next.</p><h4>What is the endangerment finding the EPA repealed?</h4><p>Let’s break down what the endangerment finding is and why it matters. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">In 2009</a>, after years of extensive scientific review, EPA officially determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. This “endangerment finding,” as it’s known, was based on overwhelming evidence from EPA’s own experts, the <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/national-academies-publish-new-report-reviewing-evidence-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-u-s-climate-health-and-welfare\">U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine</a>, and the scientific community that shows that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from extracting and burning fossil fuels <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/epa-endangerment-finding-fs.pdf\">drive global climate change</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">harm people</a>.</p><p>The finding was legally critical. Under the U.S. Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to regulate substances that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7408#:~:text=and%20control%20techniques-,U.S.%20Code,(C)\">“cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”</a> Once the EPA made that determination for greenhouse gases, the agency was legally obligated to act. The finding became the legal foundation for federal climate policy, including regulating vehicle, industrial and power plant emissions and treating climate change as a public health issue under the EPA’s authority.</p><h4>What does the repeal of the endangerment finding mean? </h4><p>After 16 years, spanning multiple U.S. administrations and Congresses, the EPA has now issued <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-07/420d25003.pdf\">a rule saying that the scientific evidence and legal interpretation</a> behind the endangerment finding were wrong and must be rescinded. This doesn’t eliminate all regulation of air pollution. The <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/naaqs/ozone-o3-air-quality-standards\">EPA still regulates pollutants such nitrous oxide and ozone</a>. But the repeal specifically targets the <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/massachusetts-v-epa\">legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases from extracting and burning fossil fuels</a>.</p><p>The impact is sweeping. The endangerment finding underpinned regulations across multiple sectors, including emissions limits for consumer vehicles, commercial vehicles and heavy-duty trucks, standards for <a href=\"https://woods.stanford.edu/news/epa-endangerment-finding-explained-5-facts-about-science-and-health-risks\">coal-fired and natural gas power plants</a>, and federal sustainability requirements that <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way\">shape government procurement and broader market behavior</a>.</p><p>It also served as a justification for grant programs aimed at reducing emissions, many of which were already <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-green-bank-zeldin-climate-trump-5168d11b7f63aeaf72001b50221c3c19\">eliminated in last year’s congressional</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-house-targets-big-climate-clean-energy-rollbacks-budget-proposal-2025-05-12/\">reconciliation bill</a>. In practical terms, without the endangerment finding, regulating greenhouse gas emissions is no longer a legal requirement. The science hasn’t changed, but the obligation to act on it has been removed. </p><h4>What are the implications for people, households and livelihoods?  </h4><p>Without federal action to curb emissions, the impacts of climate change will only intensify, and American families will bear the financial and health burden. The impacts are both immediate and long-term. Many are already happening.</p><p>For example, climate change-related impacts are already <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings\">increasing food costs</a>. Beef prices are <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings#:~:text=Farm-level%20cattle%20prices%20were,egg%20production%20continues%20to%20recover.\">rising to record highs</a> as <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/08/14/human-emissions-drove-megadrought-western-us#:~:text=Greenhouse%20gas%20and%20aerosol%20emissions,lead%20author%20of%20the%20study.\">droughts</a> in western states, <a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/news/new-research-finds-rising-heat-driving-western-us-droughts-2024-11-08\">intensified by rising temperatures</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/sector-at-a-glance\">drastically reduced usable grazing land and cattle herds</a>. Thousands of acres of <a href=\"https://www.farmprogress.com/vegetables/florida-vegetable-crops-hit-by-arctic-air-mass\">vegetables in Florida</a> and the Southeast have likely been destroyed by extreme cold snaps. <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/economic-impact-climate-change-northwest-farms\">Climate change is affecting food production</a> by altering growing conditions and increasing the frequency of extreme weather, such as drought, heat or extreme cold. This can have <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/economic-impact-climate-change-northwest-farms#:~:text=As%20the%20impacts%20of%20climate,rising%20temperatures%20and%20declining%20snowpack.\">negative economic effects</a> on both farmers and consumers.</p><p>Families may <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/reduce-heat-islands\">face higher energy bills</a>, <a href=\"https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/study-finds-emergency-room-visits-rise-sharply-hotter-days-california\">increased emergency room visits</a> in some regions and rising health care costs associated with heat waves and poorer air quality. <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2791\">Insurance premiums will likely rise</a> as climate disasters become more frequent and severe. In some areas, <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2791\">coverage is becoming harder to obtain or afford</a>, which can affect <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32579/w32579.pdf\">housing costs</a>.</p><p>At the community level, increasing floods, fires and droughts <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/water\">will strain water and energy systems</a>. Some places <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/09/climate-disasters-displaced-250-million-people-in-past-10-years-un-report-finds\">may even become unlivable</a> from being too expensive, too unstable or simply too dangerous to stay. The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01721\">costs compound</a> from <a href=\"https://www.germanwatch.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Climate%20Risk%20Index%202025.pdf\">infrastructure repairs</a>, emergency response and displacement. </p><h4>What are the implications for businesses? </h4><p><a href=\"https://riskybusiness.org/uploads/files/RiskyBusiness_PrintedReport_FINAL_WEB_OPTIMIZED.pdf\">Businesses may face higher costs</a> due to rising <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/whats-driving-us-electricity-prices\">electricity prices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/climate-risk-for-insurers\">rising insurance costs</a> to cover climate disaster recovery. </p><p>In addition, the repeal could potentially create unexpected legal risks for some businesses. The endangerment finding has provided certain legal protections for companies, as the existence of federal climate regulation has been <a href=\"https://www.climatecasechart.com/collections/american-electric-power-co-v-connecticut_45acf3\">a factor when dismissing some lawsuits</a>. Its removal may change this legal landscape for businesses, possibly exposing power plant operators and other companies <a href=\"https://www.businessinsurance.com/trumps-repeal-of-climate-rule-opens-new-pathway-for-litigation/\">to litigation</a>. </p><h4>Why are vehicle emissions being repealed alongside the endangerment finding? </h4><p>The endangerment finding <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep549/usrep549497/usrep549497.pdf\">originated </a>from a specific section of the Clean Air Act that deals with vehicle emissions. This <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">section </a>required the EPA to determine whether pollution from vehicles endangers health and welfare. </p><p>Once the EPA made that <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2009/12/15/E9-29537/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-for-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a-of-the-clean\">determination</a> for greenhouse gases from vehicles in 2009, the agency <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/document/events-leading-to-regulation-of-greenhouse-gases-under-the-clean-air-act/#:~:text=With%20the%20endangerment%20finding%20released%2C%20EPA%20was,Section%20202(a)%20of%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act.\">used the same finding</a> as the legal foundation for regulating emissions from other sources like <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/23/2015-22837/standards-of-performance-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-new-modified-and-reconstructed-stationary\">power plants, buildings</a> and other forms of <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/11/2020-28882/control-of-air-pollution-from-airplanes-and-airplane-engines-ghg-emission-standards-and-test\">transport</a>. So, the vehicles were ground zero but the implications spread far beyond cars and trucks.</p><p>By repealing vehicle emissions standards first, the EPA is targeting the most direct application of the endangerment finding. But it sets up a domino effect. If the finding doesn’t apply to vehicles, where it originated, it <a href=\"https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EPAs-Proposal-to-Eliminate-the-Endangerment-Finding-and-Motor-Vehicle-Greenhouse-Gas-Regulations.pdf\">undermines the legal basis</a> for greenhouse gas regulations across all sectors. That’s why the two repeals are linked. </p><h4>Can the repeal be challenged?</h4><p>A number of entities already <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/media/edf-ucs-file-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-secret-convening-climate-skeptics-use-their\">filed lawsuits in 2025</a> challenging the EPA’s initial steps to repeal the endangerment finding. <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2026/02/sierra-club-statement-trump-administration-s-planned-elimination-epa-s\">Additional </a>legal actions are likely to follow when the final rule is published. Something this important, in place for 16 years, won’t go without a fight.  </p><h4>What does this mean for US leadership in the world? </h4><p>By <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/\">withdrawing</a> from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in early 2026, the U.S. became the only nation refusing to participate in climate change discussions and negotiations. Other countries are not following the U.S. in abandoning climate targets, and some have <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/trumps-words-arent-stopping-many-countries-from-setting-higher-climate-goals/\">reaffirmed or even raised their climate goals</a> despite U.S. pressure.</p><p>However, the rest of the world takes notice when the U.S. turns its back on rock-solid science and tries to convince people to not believe their own eyes — and wallets. The U.S. <a href=\"https://theloop.ecpr.eu/us-withdrawal-from-major-environmental-international-organisations-weakens-its-credibility/\">risks losing trust</a> among friends and allies that its policy decisions are grounded in facts and science and that it’s a reliable partner. Other nations, like <a href=\"https://eccoclimate.org/what-are-the-challenges-facing-europe-and-the-world-in-2026/\">China</a>, will position themselves as reliable partners and economic leaders just as the U.S. pulls back.</p><p>Moving away from science doesn’t just weaken U.S. environmental and public health policies. It threatens U.S. leadership on every issue where credibility matters, from <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/step-back-from-climate-cooperation-will-hurt-us-economy-statement-from-un-climate-chief-on-us\">trade and finance</a> to <a href=\"https://www.policycenter.ma/publications/turning-back-clock-industrial-economic-and-diplomatic-fallout-us-climate-policy#:~:text=The%20second%20Trump%20administration's%20reversal,%2C%20and%20renewable%2Denergy%20manufacturing.\">industry competitiveness</a> to national <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/17/us-military-has-cared-about-climate-change-dawn-of-cold-war-good-reason.html\">security</a>.  </p><p> </p><p><em>Correction, 02/13/2025: A previous version of this article stated that droughts have drastically reduced \"grazing land\".

      "description": "<p><strong>February 12, 2026 (Washington, DC)</strong> — Today the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a rule that will make it harder for EPA and future administrations to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Greenhouse gas emissions result from extracting and burning fossil fuels and contribute to a warming planet and dangerous impacts of climate change.</p><p>This new rule overturns the agency’s own scientific finding established after years of scientific and economic analysis, which concluded that greenhouse gas pollution endangers human health, thus requiring regulation and oversight to protect people and the environment.</p><p>In addition, EPA repealed greenhouse gas emissions standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles.<br /><br /><strong>Following is a statement from World Resources Institute (WRI) U.S. Director David Widawsky:</strong></p><p>“Every person and business in America should be alarmed that the U.S. government is walking away from its responsibility to protect their health and their wallets.</p><p>“Most people have never heard of this safeguard — the “endangerment” finding — but repealing it sends a clear message: this government doesn’t care. It doesn’t care that hotter summers are driving up energy bills and sending people to emergency rooms. It doesn’t care that extreme weather is raising homeowner insurance, pricing families out of mortgages and homes. It doesn’t care that many businesses will now no longer be protected from lawsuits over climate effects. It doesn’t care that farmers are losing crops and livestock, raising the price of groceries. The bottom line is that repealing these protections will make everyday life more expensive, more risky and more uncertain for Americans.</p><p>“EPA’s own settled science shows that managing greenhouse gases is fundamental to protecting Americans. Rolling back these safeguards is a dangerous breach of responsibility to protect people, the environment, and our economy, benefitting polluters at the expense of all people.”</p>",

As the world warms, there is an urgent need for a multitude of workers to shore up the resilience of our crops and fisheries, revive biodiversity hotspots, and restore our terrestrial and wetland ecosystems. Similarly, there is growing demand for technicians to retrofit our buildings into energy-efficient shields against extreme heat and other climate threats.</p><p>Like any great economic shift, some sectors will benefit more than others. Agriculture and land use could be one of the largest sources of employment, with regenerative agriculture and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\">nature-based solutions</a> generating 195 million new jobs — equivalent to about 17% of the sector’s current workforce. Construction could see the largest percentage growth, adding 175 million jobs. That’s roughly 70% of today’s construction workforce. </p><p>This is a significant opportunity — but one that’s not guaranteed. </p><p>Securing hundreds of millions of good jobs requires governments and businesses to invest now in workforce development. This means equipping workers with the skills they need to install wind turbines and solar panels, retrofit buildings to reduce energy use, shift from conventional to sustainable farming, and more. It means re-skilling people whose jobs may disappear, such as fossil fuel workers, while creating new opportunities for the labor force of the future. It means developing entrepreneurship to enable job growth. And it means righting some of the wrongs of the past, like expanding roles for women and others historically boxed out of job markets.</p><p>Prioritizing people and their livelihoods can deliver so much more than job growth — it makes the transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy politically durable. If we get this transition right, it can ultimately create stronger economies, improve social cohesion as well as curb climate change.</p><p>While the low-carbon transition is likely to generate net job gains, it will involve substantial job churn. A total of 630 million workers will potentially be affected by job transitions. This is particularly evident in the energy space. While the sector will ultimately add 20 million jobs in electrification, renewable energy development, and power grid expansion, there will be less demand for jobs focused on fossil fuel extraction. </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive-diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27296283/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>That’s why investing in workforce development and re-skilling is so essential. Opportunities and risks will need to be managed as jobs will be gained and lost across sectors and geographies. The transition can’t leave anyone behind — and with the promise of so many new jobs, it doesn’t have to. </p><p>But countries that potentially have the most to gain in terms of job creation are also the least equipped to seize the opportunity due to their labor market structure and lack of skills readiness and social protection measures. This includes many low-income countries in Africa.</p><p>Against this backdrop, closing the widening skills gaps in foundational, technical and transversal skills must become a much greater priority. The scale of the challenge is staggering: More than 760 million adults aged 15 and older do not possess basic numeracy and literacy skills; meanwhile, and 70% of children in low or middle-income countries cannot read by age 10. And while data on skills are relatively weak, estimates show that nearly three-quarters of youth aged 15-24 are off track in acquiring employment-relevant skills. </p><p>While these foundational skills are lagging, demand for green skills grew at a rate of 12% from 2023 to 2024 — twice the rate of supply. </p><p>Unless we take action to prepare now, the world will be hurtling toward a massive \"talent crunch\" that threatens to hold the global economy back and put a safe and sustainable future out of reach. </p><p>For example, a projected 14% shortfall in the number of renewable energy workers needed by 2030 could significantly slow the deployment of low-carbon technologies and delay emissions reductions. Over time, such delays would translate into higher cumulative emissions and increase the risk of additional warming, estimated at up to 0.7 degrees C. Every tenth of a degree of warming matters, increasing the risk of floods, droughts, wildfires and other dangerous impacts.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People restore mangroves in Indonesia\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/mangrove-restoration-project_0.jpg?VersionId=DVrNtm6tihDXVWKYoodJCM.6x24wMbbH&itok=mSIVt078\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Restoring mangrove trees in Tangerang, Indonesia.

They’ll need to improve labor market data and analysis and mobilize a better funded and more integrated policy response. This isn’t yet happening widely. Only half of countries’ <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">national climate plans, or “NDCs,”</a> reference workforce development strategies; only 1% offer concrete means of financing them. Corporate strategies are similarly scant on green skill-building.</p><p>The Philippines offers a model for others to follow. The country made green jobs a legislative priority, enshrined in policies like the Green Jobs Act, the Philippine Development Plan and the Labor and Employment Plan. It has also brought federal agencies together through the Inter-agency Committee on Green Jobs, led by the Department of Labor, to align education, environment, trade and finance around a shared goal: prioritizing green workforce development and skill-building.  This is the sort of coordinated planning and policymaking that can integrate low-carbon jobs across all parts of the economy.</p><p><strong>Innovation </strong>is also key. Governments and businesses need to test, identify and scale a new generation of workforce development programs that are fit for purpose, flexible and modular, often working with delivery and implementation partners to translate policy objectives into effective programs. This should include building smart accreditation and job matching platforms that offer pathways to jobs and livelihoods. Programs should prepare people for new and emerging low-carbon, climate-resilient jobs, as well as re-skill existing workers whose jobs are evolving. They should also include those typically left out of workforce development programs, like informal workers, women and rural communities.</p><p>In Pakistan, energy utility company K-Electric’s Roshni Baji program is one example of innovative workforce development. The program helps women from low-income areas become certified electricians, a historically male-dominated field. Alongside technical skills, women receive education in motorbike riding, self-defense, communication and stress management. It has already trained 200 women with electrical skills that are easily transferable to solar installation, microgrid maintenance, energy audits and other activities essential for greening the energy system. This is the type of innovation that can ensure the low-carbon transition benefits everyone.</p><p>And finally, none of this will happen without sustained <strong>investment. </strong>Workforce development and education are chronically underfunded, often treated as an expense rather than a high-return investment. Lower-income countries spend less than 0.1% of GDP on labor market programs. While high-income countries spend more, the percentage share has been declining over the past 2 decades. Governments and corporations alike must work together to align fiscal policy with employment goals and create the right incentives for businesses to invest in the capabilities of their workers. There’s a role for financial institutions like the multilateral development banks, too, in embedding workforce investments into climate and development finance.</p><p>Kenya’s plans show promise in this area. The country’s draft Green Fiscal Incentives Policy Framework seeks to mobilize private investments for a low-emissions, resilient economy — particularly in agriculture, which supports nearly 25% of Kenya’s GDP and is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The framework proposes tools to attract and de-risk private finance. They include: a Green Investment Bank and Credit Guarantee Scheme to unlock loans for agribusinesses and green small- and medium-sized enterprises; a Green Bonds framework to channel capital market investments; and capacity-building to equip the workforce with relevant green skills. If effectively implemented, these mechanisms could stimulate job creation across sustainable farming, renewable energy for irrigation, and agricultural processing — sectors that are vital for both climate resilience and rural employment. This is the type of finance that can create multiple benefits at once.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Maintenance workers service a giant wind turbine\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/wind-turbine-maintenance_0.jpg?VersionId=u9peczomrlUxKFS7qLgsRbweWqBzjDDj&itok=igkKfJig\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Maintenance workers service a giant wind turbine.

Countries that adapt quickly will attract investment, lower costs, and create good, steady jobs. Those that hesitate simply risk falling behind.</p><p>The transition to a new and more resilient, low-carbon economy is ultimately about improving people’s lives, both today and in the future. This is true for so many things —  breathing cleaner air, reducing energy bills, easing traffic congestion, and protecting communities from escalating storms, wildfires and withering heat. And if we seize this enormous opportunity, we can also deliver well-paid jobs, stronger local economies, and a more secure future for workers and their communities.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Twenty years ago, the forested slopes above Alpine Acres — a small community at the source of the Weber River in Summit County, Utah — were overgrown with dry brush and primed for wildfire. With only one road in and out, residents feared their community could be engulfed by the next catastrophic blaze — the same deadly trap people found themselves in during the <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.2252.pdf\">Paradise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/nist-updates-critical-wildfire-evacuation-and-sheltering-guidance\">Lahaina</a> wildfires.</p><p>But today, the landscape looks markedly different.  </p><p>The dense stands of trees and bushes have been replaced by a more open forest with meadows and cleared strips of land, known as fuel breaks, designed to slow or stop wildfires. By removing excess vegetation that serves as fuel for fire along the access road and around private properties, state officials have improved evacuation safety and reduced the risk of homes burning.  </p><p>“We’re one of the very first <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/firewise-usa\">Firewise</a> communities in the state of Utah,” said Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres. “Firewise means you’re aware of how fire could start on your property and in the whole community. When we first built houses up here, people weren’t thinking about that and some even had wooden shingle roofs. But gradually, people started to change how they build and maintain their land.” </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres, speaks in front of an aspen grove on his property.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/jim-w-in-alpine-acres.JPG?VersionId=.jc9tKvMQAo42qxHekBWrLkxvj5L_cwf&itok=MWSTWL7I\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres, speaks in front of an aspen grove on his property.

Crucially, this sort of work can happen faster and on a greater scale than before thanks to a new funding model, the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/project/the-utah-resilience-fund/\">Utah Resilience Fund</a> (URF). Invented and deployed by a coalition of partners including Summit County, World Resources Institute, the U.S. Forest Service and others, the fund is reshaping how Utah manages wildfire risk and water security.</p><h3>A Fund to Address Catastrophic Wildfire Risk at Scale </h3><p>For decades, wildfire funding in the U.S. has typically been reactive, mobilizing resources only after fires ignite. In Utah alone, fire suppression <a href=\"https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2024/08/23/utah-spend-almost-12-million-fighting-wildfires/\">topped $28 million in 2024</a> with the state shouldering about a quarter of that cost. Yet states could actually <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800924001411\">save money in the long run</a> by investing upfront in forest restoration. This investment can avoid the devastating economic and human toll of catastrophic fires while also creating more jobs, recreation and water security.  </p><p>That’s where the Utah Resilience Fund comes in. Founded in 2020, it brings together public, private and philanthropic partners to take proactive steps, before disaster strikes. So far, the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/story/utah-resilience-fund/\">URF has raised more than $8.4 million</a> for faster, more flexible funding for restoration on both public and private lands, ensuring forest and watershed health treatments complement each other across boundaries. Beyond meeting urgent short-term needs, it also sets some funds aside in an <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0131.html\">income-generating endowment</a> to help sustain this work over the long term.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"823\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"658\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"504\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"397\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"238\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The Utah Resilience Fund Model\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/the-utah-resilience-fund-model.png?VersionId=PXl.JBcyL3H5DitG4.DrHqjHexvVBAX6&itok=DgsAEKAf\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>“The way we look at it now is to get ahead of the potential wildfire that we know is coming,” said Dano Jauregui, district ranger for the Heber-Kamas Ranger District of the U.S. Forest Service. “It costs far less to prepare the landscape upfront than to try to control or suppress a large fire later.” </p><h3>From the Weber Headwaters to the Great Salt Lake </h3><p>Improved wildfire resilience does not just protect homes from flames. It also safeguards Utah’s most precious resource — water. Catastrophic wildfire can send ash, sediment and chemical contaminants into the reservoirs, reducing storage capacity and threatening drinking water supplies. Overly dense and fire-prone forests can also draw down groundwater levels, leading to reduced water availability. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The upper Weber River flows through the community of Alpine Acres.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/upper-weber-river.JPG?VersionId=HvozpJTn31nLggpV8qH9iLtyzRpLaKxV&h=b39c5fef&itok=J22AH7Nl\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The upper Weber River flows through the community of Alpine Acres.

Decades of <a href=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/\">fire suppression</a> (putting out fires immediately), combined with <a href=\"https://naturalresources.utah.gov/dnr-newsfeed/drought-in-utah-more-than-a-water-supply-issue/\">higher temperatures and prolonged drought</a>, have disrupted this natural cycle. Forests are now overgrown with dense vegetation and dead trees, creating fuel for high-intensity wildfire. These types of wildfires <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2006/11/23/hayman-fire-still-mucking-up-water/\">scorch and damage soil</a>, send sediment downstream and ultimately degrade water quality.</p><p>To restore balance, land managers use forest thinning (selectively removing smaller and unhealthy trees), prescribed burns (carefully applying fire to a landscape), and other techniques to reduce accumulated fuel, lower wildfire risk and protect the watersheds that provide clean water downstream. Innovative financial mechanisms such as the Utah Resilience Fund and the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/project/forest-resilience-bond/\">Forest Resilience Bond</a> help to pay for this work upfront, enabling faster, larger-scale restoration.   </p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-Utah-Forest-Management.pdf\">Forest Management FAQ</a> and <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-Utah-Resilience-Fund.pdf\">URF FAQ</a>.</p></div><p>This is especially true in Utah, <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8476/\">the second driest state in the country</a>, where many forested headwaters lie in high wildfire risk zones. A core area where the URF is accelerating wildfire risk reduction is across the Weber River watershed. Originating in the snow-fed headwaters of the Uinta Mountains, the Weber flows through a mosaic of public and private lands, before draining into the Great Salt Lake, a region of immense economic and ecological importance.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\">A <strong>watershed</strong> (also called a drainage basin or catchment) is an area of land where rain and snowmelt flow from higher ground to join into streams and rivers, and eventually drain into a larger water body, such as a reservoir or ocean. </p></div><p>The river provides drinking water to over 700,000 Utahns in Summit, Morgan, Weber and Davis counties through the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (WBWCD), the primary water supplier for much of northern Utah. Several reservoirs fed by the Weber River, surrounded by forests, are managed by the district.    </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"2100\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1680\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1287\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"1013\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The Weber River begins in the Uinta mountains where communities like Alpine Acres sit at its source. \" height=\"607\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/the-weber-river.jpeg?VersionId=Uti34TO.I4n_rRyOcTQbaelR4Tqxh0l8&itok=5yTS6w6U\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Weber River begins in the Uinta mountains where communities like Alpine Acres sit at its source.

Over the next decade, the USFS plans to treat 14,000 acres in the upper Weber watershed. This work will include creating a network of fuel breaks and thinning projects to reduce fire intensity and improve ecological health.</p><p>But treating federal lands alone isn’t enough. Fire doesn’t respect administrative boundaries, and real wildfire risk reduction requires cross boundary treatments that include restoring the surrounding private lands. The URF helps make this possible through funding adjacent fuel reduction projects in communities such as Alpine Acres, and further downstream, the <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4adda37668974b6b8eae31e90707ecfb\">910 Ranch</a>.  </p><p>Once a working sheep ranch established in the late 1800s, this 8,500-acre property straddles the source of East Canyon Creek, a key tributary of the Weber River, and is one of the last contiguous mountain ranches in the Park City area. Through the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/private-land/forest-legacy\">Forest Legacy Program</a>, a federal grant program to protect lands from development, Summit County and partners recently <a href=\"https://www.parkrecord.com/2026/01/27/summit-county-has-officially-closed-on-the-910-cattle-ranch/\">secured the land’s permanent protection</a>. This ensures this tract of land will continue to preserve the forests and meadows that safeguard water supplies. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The historic Jeremy cabin sits on the 910 Cattle Ranch in front of rolling hills.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/the-historic-jeremy-cabin.JPG?VersionId=Jq0BAh6NDglMqYEduL1AZGA9VjTNF0Mp&h=0d27ee61&itok=vsiPfFjJ\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The historic Jeremy cabin sits on the 910 Cattle Ranch in front of rolling hills.

In forested areas, crews have thinned dense conifer stands across 73 acres to reduce fuel loads and create a mosaic of openings that function as natural fire breaks. All these piles of conifers will be burned this winter, and debris along road corridors has already been chipped to improve safe access for emergency personnel.   </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Stacked piles of trees and brush\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/stacked-piles-of-trees-and-brush.JPG?VersionId=LztTDJGpJTNcM1PLPWnmDlwNLEn8nTLo&itok=Au--1NVY\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Stacked piles of trees and brush that have been thinned during a fuel reduction project on 910 Ranch to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health.

In the valley of the 910 Ranch, additional work is restoring the riverbanks to improve fish habitat and downstream water quality. “We’ve started replanting vegetation along East Canyon Creek, building cattle exclusion fences and putting in beaver dam analogs to restore the natural water flow and rebuild the streambanks,” said Kirby.  </p><p>Partners such as Trout Unlimited and local volunteers, with funding from Summit County and the Caterpillar Foundation, have planted <a href=\"https://ut-summitcounty.civicplus.com/2507/Outreach-Engagement\">over 700 willows</a> and dozens of cottonwood trees. This has helped stabilize eroding banks and provide shade for stretches of East Canyon Creek that had been grazed for more than a century. The team is also testing the reintroduction of <a href=\"https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/why-beaver-dam-analogs-work-low-tech-process-based-restoration-explained\">beaver-inspired habitat systems</a> to hold more water in the soil and extend flows through dry summer months.</p><p>For Kirby, the project is deeply personal. Having lost her home in Colorado’s 2001 Hayman Fire, she views the 910 Ranch as a generational investment in stewardship.</p><p>“This ranch is a legacy piece,” she said. “With the help of partnerships, this is going to be the biggest thing I’ll do in my career. It connects nearly 55,000 acres of protected land from Park City into Morgan County. When my grandkids come here someday, they’re going to say, ‘Look what Grandma helped do.’” </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jae-H_I0B_w\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch Utah Pioneers a New Model for Wildfire Resilience\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Video: \"Utah Pioneers a New Model for Wildfire Resilience\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>The Path Forward: Building a Model for the West</h3><p>The URF shows that proactive investment in wildfire resilience can protect forests and communities upstream, while benefiting those downstream.

      "pubDate": "Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:53:39 EST",
      "description": "<p>2026 is set to be another year of clashing trends in sustainable finance, particularly for emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), where the greatest capital shift needs to take place.</p><p>Last year, the world poured record levels of money into <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/bloombergnef-finds-global-energy-transition-investment-reached-record-2-3-trillion-in-2025-up-8-from-2024/\">clean energy investments</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-26/green-debt-sales-hit-record-levels\">green bonds and loans</a> hit an all-time high. But those tailwinds were matched by severe cuts in international public climate finance (most notably in the U.S.) as well as some countries watering down ESG regulations. Rather than derailing underlying momentum, however, these headwinds have sharpened the focus on where a rebound in leadership, innovation and coordination is most urgently needed.</p><p>We identified six strategic opportunities in 2026 for public and private investors to scale up finance needed to address the climate crisis, protect nature and improve people’s lives.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Three people installing a solar panel on a roof.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/solar-installation-south-africa_0.jpg?VersionId=qDLLY_T..gOBqCJEOSfmSpen3QSalxNP&itok=Rv2LQulq\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>In South Africa, technicians install a rooftop solar array. Photo by PixelCatchers/iStock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>1) Generating Policy Leadership to Implement the New Finance Roadmap</h3><p>Against the odds, the 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) solidified the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/650953\">Baku to Belém (B2B) Roadmap</a>. This lays out a comprehensive strategy to meet the ambitious global goal agreed at COP29: delivering $1.3 trillion a year in international finance to EMDCs for clean energy, adaptation, nature, just transition, and loss and damage by 2035.</p><p>In 2026, the focus must shift to implementation so that progress can be demonstrated by COP31 this November. This will, of course, be aided by leadership from the key international bodies for financial governance. However, the G20 is set to be missing in action as a driver of sustainable finance and climate this year under the U.S. presidency. At the high-income G7 summit, France — this year’s chair — will undoubtedly aim to broaden the dialogue with EMDCs and make progress on several granular areas of climate finance (possibly including prudential regulation). This leaves the <a href=\"https://www.brics2026.gov.in/\">BRICS</a>, with its 11 major EMDCs, with a chance to pick up the baton. Under India’s leadership this year, the group can deepen its <a href=\"https://brics.br/en/brics-leaders-champion-global-effort-for-fair-climate-finance-in-historic-rio-declaration\">2025 commitment</a> to “lead a global mobilization for a fairer and more effective International Monetary and Financial System to enhance climate finance.” (We examine opportunities for South-South cooperation in more detail <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/#south-south\">below</a>.)</p><p>Beyond high-level summits, 2026 needs to see governments and stakeholders turn to the nuts and bolts of implementing new finance commitments. Across its more than 100 member countries, the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action will give attention to expanding fiscal space in developing countries, increasing adaptation finance and supporting the new generation of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\">country platforms</a>. Meanwhile, the central bank and regulator Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is deepening its focus on the short-term risks of climate inaction for growth, financial stability and inflation.</p><h3>2) Rebooting Private Finance Flows</h3><p>One of the biggest tasks for 2026 will be to show how the B2B Roadmap’s heroic goals for expanding private finance can be achieved over the next decade. <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IHLEG-on-Climate-Finance-4th-Report-Delivering-an-integrated-climate-finance-agenda.pdf\">Half of the $1.3 trillion</a> in external flows needs to come from private sources by 2035, according to the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG) — up 16 times from the $40 billion delivered in 2022. And of the $1.9 trillion needed from domestic sources, 40% must come from the private sector (including households), a ninefold expansion from today’s levels.</p><p>The good news is that 2026 opens with core banking, investor and insurance commitments on climate and nature finance relatively robust, despite well-publicized attacks and the shuttering of net-zero alliances for banking and insurance. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/nzam-ready-for-its-next-chapter/\">Net Zero Asset Management (NZAM) initiative</a> will be relaunched early in the year. Leading asset owners have also helped to restore confidence through new allocations to sustainability themes: According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/institutional-investor-sustainability-signals-report-2025\">Morgan Stanley survey</a>, 86% of asset owners in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific expect to increase allocations to sustainable investments in the next two years.</p><p>2026 offers several key opportunities to continue increasing private finance flows:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.com/news/global-clean-power-alliance-finance-mission-publishes-global-roadmap-to-scale-private-finance-for-clean-energy-transitions-in-emerging-markets/\">Expanding private investment</a> in clean electrification in the developing countries that continue to miss out, notably in Africa. This will often require investors to work closely with multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) in the construction of bankable pipelines, platforms and policies, as well as placing a priority on worker and community benefits.</li><li>Overcoming the structural challenges facing blended finance to make it more efficient and impactful in mobilizing private capital. In 2026, the multi-country <a href=\"https://scaledevelopment.org/\">SCALED initiative</a> is set to move into its second phase of standardizing blended finance requirements, vehicle types and processes.</li><li>Aligning finance flows with nature. The next UN biodiversity summit (COP17) in October will focus attention on how to both meaningfully increase the still-tiny <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2026\">private finance flows into nature-based solutions</a> (currently around $23 billion) and structurally curb the far-larger $4.9 trillion in private capital directed into nature-negative activities.</li><li>Attracting private finance to adaptation. While <a href=\"https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P2_WRI-Scaling-Finance-for-Climate-Adaptation.pdf\">adaptation finance</a> has historically been viewed as a solely public sector priority, we expect this year to bring increasing evidence of private sector adaptation financing, including through resilience bonds.</li><li>Bringing taxonomies closer together. In terms of financial plumbing, last year’s climate summit successfully launched a set of <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/publications/principles-for-taxonomy-interoperability/\">common principles</a> to make the world’s more than 50 sustainable taxonomies interoperable. There’s opportunity to build on this in 2026, which could cut barriers to sustainable finance that stem from unnecessary definitional differences and help to further reduce transaction costs.</li><li>Closing the insurance protection gap. One of the most specific of the B2B Roadmap’s short-term priorities is for the insurance industry to work with climate-vulnerable developing countries in the V20 and beyond, as well as donor governments, to reduce the financial protection gap. The goal is to deliver a plan by October 2026 that would show how a set of pre-arranged tools could be designed to ensure that funds reach people and enterprises immediately after disasters.</li></ul><h3>3) Reviving Concessional Finance</h3><p>The B2B Roadmap reemphasized the perennial need for “developed countries to achieve manyfold increases in the delivery of grants and concessional climate finance.” But the availability of concessional funding will continue to face downward pressure in 2026, with previously announced cuts to development finance (ODA) from the U.S. and most other OECD countries further squeezing the available resources for climate action. One projection from <a href=\"https://donortracker.org/publications/budget-cuts-tracker\">Donor Tracker</a> suggests that ODA will fall from a peak of $213 billion in 2023 to just $145 billion in 2026.</p><p>Visible progress will be needed from MDBs, bilateral development finance institutions and others to expand the quantum of concessional capital by stretching balance sheets, hybrid capital and other measures. As part of the mix, the proportion of concessional funds flowing to resilience needs to be increased in line with the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/tripling-adaptation-finance-goal\">tripling goal for 2035</a> agreed at COP30. The various soul-searching reviews of international finance currently underway also provide scope for development, climate and nature finance across MDBs, vertical climate funds and bilateral mechanisms to work better together as a coherent, well-allocated whole.</p><p>One particular opportunity for progress is to expand the number of countries backing the Premium Flyers Solidarity Coalition. The goal of the Coalition is to introduce <a href=\"https://solidaritylevies.org/\">levies</a> on business class, first class and private jets as a way to channel new climate and development finance to EMDCs.</p><p>Another focus will be driving deployment of existing instruments that can make concessional funds go farther, both in terms of leveraging additional investment and securing maximum impact. This will be a major test for the growing focus on development finance to be “ <a href=\"https://www.bii.co.uk/en/news-insight/insight/articles/driving-market-level-changes-in-impact-investing/\">market shaping</a>,” “ <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/publications/transformational-finance-for-climate-unlocking-systemic-effects/\">transformational </a>” and “ <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/what-systemic-investing-and-why-are-impact-investors-taking-notice\">systemic</a>.” There is no shortage of available mechanisms that need to move into an expansion phase this year. One cluster is the more than 50 <a href=\"https://greenguaranteedirectory.org/\">green guarantee</a> structures now in existence, such as the World Bank Group’s <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/brief/guarantees-platform\">Guarantee Platform</a>, which consolidates products at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), freeing up lending for climate finance.</p><p>Another approach is the growing use of structured products as a way of tapping bond markets to generate a flow of concessional capital. For example, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF)’s <a href=\"https://www.cif.org/news/ccmm-issuance\">Capital Markets Mechanism</a> issued a first-of-its kind <a href=\"https://www.cif.org/news/ccmm-issuance\">$500 million bond</a> last year to frontload funding for climate technologies. Further bond issues in 2026 would be a positive sign of momentum. The <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/financing-nature-conservation-tropical-forest-forever-facility\">Tropical Forests Forever Facility</a> (TFFF), championed by Brazil at COP30, is a much larger model, <a href=\"https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/a-$125bn-plan-to-monetize-forest-conservation.html\">aiming to raise $100 billion</a> through the issuance of highly-rated bonds along with $25 billion in public and philanthropic capital (which would absorb losses in a blended finance approach). This pool would then be invested to generate $4 billion per year for tropical countries, with at least 20% of payments directed to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. A key test for the TFFF in 2026 will be whether it can achieve critical mass in securing the upfront public funds it needs, building on the $6.6 billion secured at COP30.</p><h3>4) Adding Urgency to Transition Finance</h3><p>The long-waited introduction of the EU’s <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en\">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism </a>(CBAM) on the first day of 2026 has lent new urgency to the transition finance agenda in developing countries. The CBAM introduces a charge on imports into the EU based on carbon performance, matching the price paid by domestic companies through the European Emissions Trading System (ETS). This means companies in affected sectors — cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, hydrogen and electricity — will increasingly be seeking financing options for new modes of production that can cut emissions and thereby avoid carbon costs.</p><p>Another policy trigger spurring transition finance will be the intensifying focus on how to speed up fossil fuel phaseout. In April, Colombia will host the first global conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels, in partnership with the Netherlands. This will bring together the growing number of countries seeking to accelerate clean energy deployment, diversify their economies from coal, oil and gas, and thereby avoid stranded assets and stranded communities. Alongside this, Brazil is driving a domestic strategy to transition away from fossil fuels (TAFF) and will lead a dialogue through to COP31 for a coordinated international approach to TAFF.</p><p>All this will place increased pressure on business to develop credible transition plans and transition finance instruments. Here, the main arena to watch in 2026 will be the market take-up of the <a href=\"https://www.icmagroup.org/sustainable-finance/the-principles-guidelines-and-handbooks/climate-transition-finance-handbook/\">recently launched guidance</a> on dedicated transition <a href=\"https://www.icmagroup.org/sustainable-finance/the-principles-guidelines-and-handbooks/climate-transition-finance-handbook/\">bonds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lsta.org/content/transition-loans-guide/\">loans</a> from the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), the Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA). Critical to this will be closing the gap between different national benchmarks of credible transition performance for key low-carbon products.</p><h3>5) Boosting Climate Innovation Ecosystems</h3><p>At the other end of the investment spectrum from today’s incumbent fossil fuel technologies lie the diverse ecosystems of climate innovation. Climate tech businesses around clean energy, battery storage and sustainable mobility <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-15/global-climate-tech-is-attracting-more-investors-than-pre-trump\">attracted $56 billion</a> in the first nine months of 2025, more than they did in all of 2024.</p><p>This finance remains unevenly spread, however. While climate tech investment in Africa <a href=\"https://insights.techcabal.com/africas-climatetech-in-2025-funding-trends-startups-scale/\">rose to upwards of $1 billion last year</a>, funding tended to flow to larger, more proven businesses. Continued declines in global ODA will likely mean further reductions in international grants for early-stage climate ventures.</p><p>As EMDCs advance their ambitions of becoming high-income economies, they will be looking for opportunities to boost private sector productivity and provide value-added links to global supply chains. In parallel, many are working to scale sustainable solutions to meet their climate targets. This year, we could see an increase in national policies geared toward boosting local green innovation that can attract commercial investment, especially in EMDCs where this is a priority. One example is <a href=\"https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1719592/resolutions-57-and-68-poised-to-drive-private-sector-growth.html\">Vietnam’s resolutions 57 and 68</a>, agenda-setting frameworks that prioritize private sector-led innovation to boost economic growth.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\"><strong>Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G)</strong> provides grants and technical assistance to help early-stage climate startups in EMDCs become investment ready. The initiative works with public-private platforms to improve enabling market conditions for startups in Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, South Africa and Vietnam. P4G is hosted by WRI and funded by Denmark, the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/partnership-green-growth-and-global-goals-p4g\">Learn more.</a></p></div><p>EMDCs may look for ways to increase the volume of their climate pipelines by integrating them with other sectors that are currently attracting investment, such as linking data centers to renewable energy sources. Additionally, we are likely to see global supply chains begin to shift as many countries look to diversify to new suppliers, creating further opportunities for green start-ups in EMDEs.</p><p>Based on the high emphasis placed on adaptation during COP30, as well as rising costs and risks of the physical impacts of climate change, we will likely see investors prioritize investments in startups focused on building climate resilience. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop30-outcomes-next-steps\">adoption of adaptation indicators</a> at COP30, while needing additional refinement, and the emergence of <a href=\"https://www.climatebonds.net/expertise/resilience-finance\">voluntary investment frameworks</a> will help establish a standardized way to measure progress and allow for clearer investment opportunities.</p><h3 id=\"south-south\">6) Charting the New Role of South-South Finance</h3><p>In the past, international climate finance discussions have largely focused on North-South flows and domestic resource mobilization. But today’s geoeconomic turbulence makes South-South financial cooperation an increasingly critical arena. Already, South-South climate cooperation amounts to about $17 billion a year — greater than direct flows of international private capital, <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IHLEG-on-Climate-Finance-4th-Report-Delivering-an-integrated-climate-finance-agenda.pdf\">according to IHLEG</a>.</p><p>At COP29 in Baku, governments agreed that South-South cooperation would form a voluntary component of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance. This inclusion reflects a paradigm shift: Developing countries are not only recipients, but also contributors to global climate solutions. While these contributions remain non-obligatory, they signal a growing commitment among EMDCs to share resources and expertise, reinforcing solidarity and mutual responsibility in addressing climate and development challenges.</p><p>These collaborations amongst the BRICS, least developed countries and the capital hubs of the Gulf not only mobilize resources, but also foster knowledge exchange and capacity building tailored to the unique challenges faced by emerging economies. As clean-economy opportunities increase and climate impacts intensify, the role of South-South finance in bridging gaps and accelerating action has never been more vital.</p><p>For 2026, the BRICS has signaled its intent to deepen collaboration on climate finance, creating a platform for emerging economies to pool resources and share best practices. This year, expect discussions on operationalizing joint investment vehicles and green bond markets under this framework. These efforts could unlock significant capital for renewable energy, resilient infrastructure and low-carbon technologies across the BRICS member states and beyond.</p><p>One crucial institution to watch is the youngest MDB, the <a href=\"https://www.ndb.int/event/new-development-bank-at-the-30th-united-nations-climate-change-conference/\">New Development Bank</a>, set up by the BRICS a decade ago. As part of its 2022-2026 Strategy, the Bank committed to dedicate at least 40% of its portfolio to climate-related finance as well as 30% in local currencies. The latest data presented at COP30 shows that climate finance is 31% of the bank’s total portfolio (excluding COVID loans). But the pace is stepping up, with climate accounting for over 55% of approvals in 2024. These goals open the door for large-scale investments in clean energy, sustainable transport and resilience projects across BRICS and other partner countries, and the potential for increased climate ambition in the NDB’s next strategy. Leveraging this commitment will require coordinated pipelines of bankable projects and innovative financing structures to maximize impact.</p><p>While South-South cooperation is gaining prominence, it is not — and should not be viewed as — a stand-alone channel separate from other international flows. In practice, these financial contributions are often channeled through existing multilateral institutions and implemented in partnership with traditional donor countries. This interconnected approach ensures that resources are deployed efficiently and aligned with global priorities. The real opportunity to watch in 2026 is how South-South cooperation can become an integral part of global climate finance architecture — working together with North-South structures to scale up implementation of the B2B Roadmap.</p><h3>From Commitment to Deployment</h3><p>These six opportunities are just some of the areas where we could see real movement toward a more sustainable financial system. Ultimately, progress in 2026 will depend less on new pledges and more on execution: translating roadmaps into monitored action, commitments into deployment, and partnerships into measurable impact for people, nature and climate.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Ethiopia has taken an important step toward stronger climate governance with the Climate Data Portal integrated into the National Digital Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation System. Led by the Ministry of Planning and Development (MoPD) with technical support from World Resources Institute, the portal brings climate-related data from key sector ministries, including the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Water and Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture, into one place, making it easier to update, verify and use.</p><p>Instead of relying on scattered spreadsheets and one-off reporting, sector ministries can now log into a single system to submit standardized climate indicators (for example, area reforested and/or afforested in million hectares; electric installed power capacity in megawatts; number of manufacturing industries transited from fossil fuel to clean energy; and area of land covered by green infrastructure and recreational areas in hectares). The portal is designed to support reporting and tracking for the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov.et/images/Polices/CRGE_Strategy_Final.pdf\">Climate-Resilient Green Economy</a> (CRGE) indicators and Nationally Determined Contributions (including <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/Ethiopia%20NDC%203.0%20Final.pdf\">NDC 3.0</a>) as well as to provide reliable data inputs for national modeling, including Ethiopia’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ethiopia-updated-ndc-climate-action\">Green Economy Model</a> (GEM).</p><h3>Centralizing Climate Data for Better Decisions</h3><p>Climate decisions are only as strong as the data behind them. Until now, climate data in Ethiopia has often been spread across institutions, reported in different formats and updated at irregular intervals. This made it more challenging to assess national progress clearly, compare performance across sectors and respond quickly when priorities changed. The Climate Data Portal helps solve this by creating a shared system that is owned by the government and built around routine reporting. For ministries, it reduces the time spent compiling and reconciling data while improving consistency through agreed indicator definitions and required metadata. For decision-makers, it offers a clearer view of progress and gaps. For partners and practitioners, it strengthens transparency and creates a more credible evidence base to support planning, finance discussions and program design.</p><h3>Key Achievements of the Climate Data Portal</h3><p>The Climate Data Portal was developed through a practical, step-by-step process. MoPD and WRI worked with Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) sector ministries to agree on priority indicators, align definitions and clarify where data will come from and who will be responsible for reporting.</p><p>The portal now includes:</p><ul><li>A secure, role-based interface for all CRGE sector ministries to submit climate indicators</li><li>Dashboards that display performance using charts and graphs</li><li>An indicator module to filter, view and download data by sector, year and theme (for example, land-use change and forestry, water resources, livestock, energy, waste, urbanization and sustainable cities, climate services and disaster risk reduction, transportation and mobility, and health)</li><li>A document library for climate strategies, policies and technical references</li><li>Integration with Ethiopia’s Digital Planning, Monitoring and Reporting System (DPMS), which aligns the portal with existing government workflows and supports data quality checks</li></ul><p>Together, these features turn climate data from static reports into something more useful: a living system that can be updated regularly and used to guide decisions.</p><h3><strong>The Strategic Importance of the Climate Data Portal</strong></h3><p>By providing more consistent and validated datasets, the Climate Data Portal strengthens the foundation for GEM-Ethiopia, supporting better calibration, scenario analysis and policy assessment. It also supports coordination across government by giving ministries a shared set of indicators and a common view of progress, which is especially important for CRGE and NDC implementation tracking.</p><h3>What’s Next?</h3><p>The next phase will focus on deepening the use and improving its functionality. Priorities include integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), expanding sectors and indicators, strengthening dashboard features and exploring future links to subnational reporting and climate finance tracking. Continued training and support for sector ministries will also be key to ensuring regular updates and strong institutional ownership.</p><p>To learn more about WRI’s ongoing work with Ethiopia’s Ministry of Planning and Development to strengthen national climate data, modeling systems and institutional capacity, visit <a href=\"https://www.wri.org\">www.wri.org</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in partnering with WRI to build on and expand this work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:sara.ascher@wri.org\">sara.ascher@wri.org</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Around the world, energy systems are undergoing rapid transformation. Rising demand, climate imperatives and technological innovation are converging to create a complex planning landscape. In response, the strategic approach known as Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) has emerged as a powerful framework that utilities and energy planners can use to balance supply and demand while finding cost-effective approaches to long-term electricity needs using renewable energy.</p><p>In many parts of the world, IRP and similar long-term planning processes (known by various names, such as Integrated Energy Planning or Integrated System Planning) are helping governments and utilities design resilient, cost-effective and equitable energy futures.</p><h3>What Is Integrated Resource Planning?</h3><p>Unlike traditional planning models that focus solely on power generation, IRP incorporates energy efficiency, demand response, storage and distributed energy resources. It also integrates broader goals such as equity, environmental protection, reliability and economic development.</p><p>The IRP process typically begins with setting clear objectives that reflect the priorities of a particular country, region or local jurisdiction — such as increasing renewable energy, reducing costs or improving energy access. Planners forecast future energy demand, evaluate resource options and use modeling tools to develop and compare scenarios. Once a preferred plan is selected, it is submitted for regulatory approval, implemented and periodically updated to reflect changing conditions.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p>This article is informed by research and insights from the<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/energy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" tabindex=\"0\" target=\"_blank\"> WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition</a>. The Center harnesses analytical power, convening ability and global expertise to help orchestrate a transition to a clean, abundant, affordable and reliable energy future by overcoming critical barriers.</p></div><p>Globally, IRP practices vary but share common principles. In the United States, for example, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/best_practices_irp_nov_2024_final_optimized.pdf\">more than 40 states</a> have formal IRP mandates that are typically updated every two to four years. In the European Union, member states submit 10-year National Energy and Climate Plans to meet EU-wide goals for decarbonization, energy efficiency and energy security. These plans are updated every two years and are supported by <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate/long-term-strategies/what-is-long-term-strategy\">long-term strategies</a> that the countries are required to develop for meeting their energy targets and emissions reduction goals under the Paris Agreement. In some developing countries, IRP and similar long-term planning processes are helping to manage rapid energy demand growth and the integration of evolving technologies, despite limited capital.</p><h3>Global Examples of Long-Term Planning Processes in Action</h3><p>Several developing countries have adopted IRP or similar frameworks to guide their energy transitions and have seen successful results:</p><ul><li><strong>Laos</strong> developed an Integrated Resource and Resilience Planning process in 2018 with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Stockholm Environment Institute. Using software modeling tools, the country developed scenarios for ensuring access to affordable and reliable power, identified renewable energy zones and developed a resilience action plan to address risks like flooding and extreme temperatures. After implementing the  process, Laos set a new record for clean energy investment, <a href=\"https://www.global-climatescope.org/markets/laos\">rising to $550 million in 2024</a>, a 5,320% increase from $10 million in 2023<strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Ghana</strong> launched its Integrated Power System Master Plan in 2018 and updated it in 2019 and 2023. Using the consulting firm ICF’s Integrated Planning Model, Ghana’s plan focuses on resilience, climate impacts and universal access. The plan includes a robust monitoring and evaluation framework and has helped expand energy access from 84% in 2018 to 90% by 2023, one of the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa.</li><li><strong>Jamaica</strong> approved a 20-year IRP in 2020 to meet its 50% renewable energy target by 2030. The plan includes solar, wind, liquified natural gas and other renewables, and is expected to mobilize over $7 billion in investment for infrastructure and energy efficiency. The country is ahead of this trajectory with <a href=\"https://jis.gov.jm/jamaica-making-progress-in-meeting-50-per-cent-renewable-energy-target/\">42% of electricity generation</a> coming from renewables.</li></ul><h4>Lessons from the US: How IRP Helped Drive Energy Stability</h4><p>In the U.S., IRP has evolved over four decades. Initially focused on reducing costs, IRP gained traction in the 1980s due to fuel price volatility and interest in energy efficiency. With the deregulation of the U.S. electricity market in the 1990s, regulators relied more on market competition to guide electricity system planning, and IRP rules in many states were loosened or repealed. But then came the California electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001: Generation capacity shortages, drought and delays in building new power plants resulted in blackouts, the collapse of a major energy company and an 800% increase in electricity prices. For the entire country, California’s crisis highlighted the importance of long-term energy planning, and regulators across the country began to renew and strengthen IRP mandates. Today, almost 80% of U.S. states require utilities to file an IRP or other long-term planning document.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26875505/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>IRP processes are tailored to the contexts of each state.  For example:</p><ul><li><strong>California</strong> uses a centralized IRP process led by the California Public Utilities Commission, aligned with greenhouse gas targets and involving utilities, stakeholders and transmission planners.</li><li><strong>Colorado</strong> requires Electric Resource Plans, and one utility in the state — Xcel Energy — uses all-source bidding to identify cost-effective projects.</li></ul><p>IRPs in the U.S. are shaped by each state’s clean energy mandates, such as Renewable Portfolio Standards, clean energy standards and energy storage requirements. More than 30 states have these types of goals, with many targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040–2050. Many utilities also set their own goals that exceed state mandates — more than 50 utilities have committed to net-zero or 100% clean energy targets.</p><p>These goals and requirements create a complex web of demands and expectations for utility compliance. But using the IRP process has enabled U.S. utilities to chart paths to simultaneously meet all of these goals and requirements: <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-023-03645-7\">A study carried out by the University of Colorado</a> found that utilities are generally on track to meet or exceed their state mandates and their own goals, and projects that the U.S. electric grid will be 100% decarbonized by 2060 if all goals are met.</p><p>But to achieve such ambitious goals, IRP approaches and modeling need to continue to evolve to tackle new challenges that surround the clean energy transition. Emerging challenges for planners involved in the IRP process include modeling energy storage, reflecting changing renewable costs, estimating natural gas prices, incorporating policy incentives and planning for new technologies like offshore wind and hydrogen. Water availability and climate change impacts are also increasingly critical issues, prompting the use of frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.deepuncertainty.org/\">Decision-Making Under Deep Uncertainty</a>, which helps utilities prepare for multiple possible futures.</p><div class=\"callout city-callout\"><p class=\"city-callout-heading\"><strong>Case Study: How IRP Can Help India Balance Demand Growth with Decarbonization </strong> </p><p>While every country has its own unique set of energy planning challenges and solutions, India presents an interesting case study of a growing economy looking to add more renewable energy in a way that’s efficient, sustainable and affordable.</p><p>Electricity demand is soaring in India, which is nearing 1.5 billion people with an expanding economy. At the same time, the country has made strong climate commitments — <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1885731\">cutting emissions intensity by 45% and reaching 50% non-fossil capacity</a> — which it <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2144627\"> achieved</a> five years ahead of schedule in July 2025. </p><p>Meanwhile, the coal sector continues to play a significant role in India’s energy mix, contributing over <a href=\"https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/executive/2025/04/Executive_Summary_March_2025_Aztual.pdf\">70% of the total electricity generated as of March 2025.</a> With falling prices of solar and battery storage systems and a more flexible power purchasing landscape for consumers, the share of renewable energy in the grid is expected to rise. However, this increase will require technical and economic solutions to manage variability, intermittency and resulting grid integration costs.</p><p>IRP can help states in India strike a balance of reliability and affordability while meeting the requirements of the Central Electricity Authority’s resource adequacy framework and state-specific regulations. While state utilities are free to make independent assumptions and projections, they need to ensure that their plans to add capacity are in sync with their share of the national targets. Otherwise, they risk facing stiff penalties. Although different states face diverse energy realities, they share a common need for more accurate demand estimation and a robust planning approach that ensures reliable and affordable power supply and prevents future deficits and/or stranded assets.</p><p>Done rightly using open-source modelling tools, an IRP process can allow regulators and policymakers in India to transparently and objectively evaluate the costs and outcomes of various energy scenarios with different supply mixes and demand projections, along with the grid resources required for meeting the projected demand. These decisions can help inform specific policy and regulatory goals that can support a more sustainable, affordable and/or reliable energy future.</p></div><h3>A Strategy for Cost-Effective Clean Energy Planning</h3><p>IRP offers a strategic pathway to accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring reliability, affordability and equity. IRP and other long-term planning processes can help align national climate goals with local development needs, optimize resource use, and build resilient energy systems.</p><p>As global energy systems evolve, IRP offers a proven, adaptable framework that can help countries design resilient, inclusive and low-carbon electricity systems that meet both present needs and future ambitions.</p>",
