That’s because these animals, known as ruminants, are the most resource-intensive to raise — requiring lots of land, water and feed to reach maturity, and sometimes, the conversion of natural ecosystems like forests to make way for pastures. Ruminants like cows and sheep also have unique digestive systems, where they emit a lot of planet-warming methane through belching.</p><p>Beef and lamb production result in significantly higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use and water pollution per ounce of protein than most alternatives.

      "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://africa.wri.org/initiatives/circular-food-systems-rwanda\">Circular Food Systems for Rwanda</a> (CIRF) project held its annual learning event from Oct. 21-Oct. 23, 2025, in Kigali, Rwanda. The main objective was to reflect on lessons and envision next steps as the project prepares to conclude in December 2026. During the event, CIRF partners and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) shared key achievements from the project, including increased revenues and new jobs created through the development of circular products. CIRF's multi-stakeholder policy platform also influenced circular food systems policy, resulting in Rwanda's adoption of two International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards on circularity and the inclusion of circular economy principles in three key government strategic documents, including the Fifth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (STA5).</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">CIRF's Impacts on Small Businesses</p><p class=\"secondary\">Through CIRF's support, 11 SMEs developed new circular products, such as pellets, compost and bakery items; 10 created new income streams by selling circular products; and nine reduced operational costs. In addition, 73 new direct jobs were created linked to circular product development through the adoption of circular business models.</p></div><p>WRI and partners are now preparing to scale CIRF's impact across Africa, establishing a replicable model for transformation through an initiative called <a href=\"https://africa.wri.org/initiatives/accelerating-circular-economy-food\">Accelerating the Circular Economy for Food</a> (ACE4Food). As the project moves from pilot stage to a multi-country initiative, the aim will shift from supporting individual enterprises to engaging government institutions and influencing policies, markets and value chains. This makes systems-level measurement essential to understand whether transformation is taking place, avoid unintended trade-offs and reinforce change across value chain actors.</p><p>With scale in mind, a key question that emerged throughout the learning event was how to capture, reflect and report on the systemic impact of projects such as ACE4Food. The puzzle remains: <strong>How do we really know if food systems are becoming more circular?</strong></p><p>It's a question that many organizations are beginning to ask, and there's no easy answer. CIRF tracks impact mostly at the level of individual businesses, capturing valuable but narrow insights. What's often missing from these types of projects are practical ways to measure the system-level impacts of circularity, such as reductions in waste and emissions, policy change, improved nutrition and more resilient communities.</p><h3>Inside our Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Impact Session</h3><p>To explore these measurement challenges more intentionally, we convened peers and funders for a dedicated MEL discussion during the CIRF learning event. Monitoring and evaluation experts unpacked challenges, shared best practices, and explored how to move toward a more aligned and meaningful way of measuring circular food systems.</p><p>The panel included MEL experts from IKEA Foundation, Resonance, WRI, IITA and SNV.</p><p>The panel of experts discussed challenges such as the resource-intensive nature of collecting quantitative data on waste and emissions; the disproportionate burden placed on entrepreneurs and small farmers in terms of data collection and sharing; and the difficulty of attributing results to specific interventions or projects.</p><p>Most panel participants acknowledged the difficulty of finding the right balance between individual and systems-level impact measurements. Current efforts are concentrated on policy changes, with the future aim of broader systemic evaluation.</p><p>Key obstacles include the lack of collective measurement frameworks and user-friendly tools across programs. There is also uncertainty around how to track complex changes, like market dynamics and policy adoption. Participants discussed practical solutions, including building SME capacity for self-monitoring, leveraging multi-stakeholder platforms to influence government policy alignment (particularly with Rwanda's nationally determined contribution), and shifting from attribution to contribution models that harvest outcomes and signs of change.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Farm workers tending compost heaps. \" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/rwanda-farmers-cirf_0.JPG?VersionId=p7xwXsRgnpfzdLIzvGeVnIvaIjYEBs8a&itok=Yyvym4KB\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Workers tending compost heaps at Elim Plus Farm in Nyagatare, Rwanda.

The process typically starts by collecting stories of change across stakeholders and then verifying those changes. At the individual level, these might be changes in knowledge, behavior, skills or business metrics. At the system level, they may include shifts in relationships, rules, dynamics or broader patterns. The next step is to identify how a specific intervention contributed to the change.</p><h4>Contribution analysis</h4><p>This approach mirrors the outcome-harvesting process but is anchored in a theory of change. Contribution analysis examines whether an intervention followed the expected pathway and contributed to the expected outcomes. For systems-level change, contribution pathways are more complex, often requiring documentation of behavioral or relational shifts and consideration of alternative explanations, including political turnover or other external forces.</p><h4>Market systems framework</h4><p>A market systems framework is a way of understanding how a market actually functions by looking beyond individual actors to the wider set of relationships, exchanges, incentives, and formal or informal rules that shape a value chain. Rather than focusing only on outputs or short-term results, it helps identify who interacts with whom; what motivates different actors; and how power, information and resources flow through the system. This approach often draws on tools such as outcome harvesting to document what has changed over time and social network analysis to reveal patterns of collaboration and influence. By paying attention to small, incremental shifts in behavior, coordination and decision-making, a market systems framework supports sense-making in complex environments and helps practitioners understand how broader change is emerging, even before large or visible outcomes take place.</p><h3>What Signals of Systems Change Might Look Like</h3><p>Based on these approaches, we asked one central question: <strong>If a food system is becoming more circular, what are the tangible results?</strong></p><p>Our panel outlined several early \"signals\" that can hint at whether circularity is beginning to take root in a system long before major policy milestones or market shifts appear:</p><ol><li><strong>Changing behaviors and norms: </strong>Many systemic changes begin with people, rather than policies. Signals might include growing consumer interest in circular products, farmers becoming more aware of circular practices, or knowledge-sharing spreading organically through communities. These changes often show up first in attitudes and relationships before hard numbers.</li><li><strong>Environmental practices as the default:</strong> Early indicators of environmental transformation are often subtle, like more farmers adopting waste-to-value practices, improvements in water use and recycling, or local experimentation with regenerative inputs. These shifts point to a system in which circularity is no longer a niche idea but part of routine practice.</li><li><strong>Market evolution:</strong> Economic signals, like increased commercialization of circular products, new financing models, or financial institutions showing stronger understanding of circularity, suggest the market is beginning to reward circular behavior. These signals don't require massive industry overhauls; they often start as small but telling adjustments in incentives.</li><li><strong>Governance and policy alignment: </strong>The strongest signals of systems change often appear in the enabling environment. This includes circularity showing up in the language of public officials, broadening participation in multi-stakeholder platforms, or new policy proposals aligned with circular economy goals. These signals are often incremental and difficult to capture before formal policies are enacted, which can create challenges in identification.</li><li><strong>Multidimensionality: </strong>Genuine systems change must show coherence across social, environmental and economic progress rather than spikes in one area. It's important not to over-index on one domain (for example, economic growth) and miss unintended trade-offs.</li></ol><p>Each indicator on its own does not confirm systems transformation. But in combination, they help practitioners sense whether circularity is beginning to take root and where reinforcing interventions may be needed. These indicators also reflect the reality that systems change is often detectable long before it can be conclusively measured.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Waste recycling bins at a farm.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/cirf-waste-separation_0.JPG?VersionId=XMfwHzFGz.lQyNfV8Iqpr3CYVGJ59ye8&itok=RnGrfOxA\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Waste recycling bins at Elim Plus Farm in Nyagatare, Rwanda. Photo by BIG-SOUNDS AV Solutions Ltd/WRI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Toward a Shared Understanding of Circular Impact</h3><p>The annual learning event indicated that CIRF is still at the early stages of building shared systems-level measurement approaches. The discussion built on the success of circularity projects at the SME and policy level in Rwanda and reflected on the larger ambition of systems transformation. It is clear that the tools and frameworks to measure circularity at scale are not currently accessible in the project but are beginning to develop.</p><p>Ultimately, answering the initial question - \"How do we really know if food systems are becoming more circular?\" - will require collaboration and shared learning. Measuring systems change, rather than only individual outcomes, will be essential to understanding whether this work is contributing to real transformation.</p><p>Several questions remain to help frame further work:</p><ul><li>What does systemic change look like in a specific context?</li><li>What would demonstrate proof of transformative change in agri-food systems?</li><li>What tools and lenses can help monitor the systems-level outcomes and impacts of circular interventions?</li></ul><div>With so many interventions working toward similar goals in the same region, we want to continue exploring how best to align, coordinate, and accelerate circular food systems transformation.

      "description": "<p>As the U.S. federal government continues to roll back crucial environment and climate legislation, California’s climate leadership is more important than ever — including its policies to scale up <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-ways-remove-carbon-pollution-sky\">carbon dioxide removal</a> (CDR), which includes a suite of technological processes that remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. CDR is necessary to address greenhouse gas emissions from hard to abate sources, which along with deep emissions reductions, can achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>As the <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/04/23/california-is-now-the-4th-largest-economy-in-the-world/\">fourth largest economy</a> in the world and an engine of innovation, California has the economic and entrepreneurial capacity to incubate a large enough CDR industry to drive lower costs and learning-by-doing, increasing the likelihood that other states or national governments will adopt similar policies. California also has a comprehensive climate policy framework that will ensure that CDR <em>supplements</em> —rather than substitutes for — deep emissions reductions.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>California's Climate Legislation</strong></p><ul><li>* The <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1279\">2022 Climate Crisis Act</a> requires at least an 85% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2045.<br /> </li><li>* California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) 2022 <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/ab-32-climate-change-scoping-plan/2022-scoping-plan-documents\">Scoping Plan</a> lays out a path for 85% emissions reductions and includes CDR targets (7 million tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030; 75 million tons annually by 2045) to neutralize the remaining hard-to-abate emissions.<br /> </li><li>* As part of <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB905\">SB 905</a> implementation, work is underway at CARB to develop protocols for how CDR projects are conducted and measured.<br /> </li><li>* <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB840\">SB 840</a> allocates $85 million for fiscal year 2026-2027 from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for climate-focused projects that advance California’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045.<br /> </li><li>* <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1207\">AB 1207</a> extends California’s Cap and Invest program to 2045.</li></ul></div><p>In September, the California legislature passed a <a href=\"https://www.catf.us/2025/11/balancing-climate-ambition-affordability-reflecting-californias-2025-legislative-session/\">substantial package</a> of climate and energy legislation, which included an unmistakable signal of support for CDR via a bill known as the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB643\">Carbon Dioxide Removal Purchase Program (SB 643)</a>, which saw nearly unanimous legislative support. SB 643 would have established a $50 million grant program to fund innovative, verifiable CDR projects in California no later than 2035. It would have also mandated matching private sector funds, ultimately creating a $100 million program.</p><p>However, when SB 643 reached Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, he vetoed it. While still recognizing the importance of CDR to achieving the state’s net-zero goals, he <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SB-643-Veto.pdf\">noted</a> that SB 643’s program could be implemented using funds allocated under a previously passed bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB840\">SB 840</a>, which allocates $85 million for climate-focused innovation and deployment projects that advance California’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. This legislation expands on the state’s suite of climate policies helping define the role of CDR.</p><p>Although it was surprising and disappointing to have SB 643 vetoed, California policymakers have other tools that can and should be used to achieve the goals of the legislation.</p><h3>Directing State Funds Toward CDR Sends an Essential Demand Signal</h3><p>Outside of the<a href=\"https://autl.assembly.ca.gov/system/files/2025-07/sb-643-caballero_0.pdf\"> overwhelming bipartisan legislator support</a> for SB 643, numerous private sector stakeholders, including CDR project developers and environmental non-government organizations, showed support. Leading voluntary carbon market buyers were encouraged by the prospect of high-quality carbon credits funded by the program.  </p><p>This highlights an innovative ecosystem ready to build and the momentum echoes the positive market response observed from the U.S. Department of Energy’s $35 million <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/fecm/funding-notice-carbon-dioxide-removal-purchase-pilot-prize\">CDR Purchase Pilot Prize</a> launched in 2023 — the first instance of government policy to directly purchase CDR credits. Even without a mandate, at least one private sector buyer, Google, made a <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/pledge-to-support-carbon-removal-solutions/\">public pledge</a> to match 100% of the prize awards, setting off a broader wave of demand signals, which in turn enabled project developers to raise capital. Although this program is no longer active, the Department of Energy had selected <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-dioxide-removal-purchase-pilot-prize-phase-1-semifinalists\">12 companies</a> as semi-finalists in mid-2024, most of which were California-based, further demonstrating the state’s leadership for CDR know-how and project development.</p><p>Without an immediate, reliable demand signal backed by public funds, California faces a real risk that its homegrown companies will relocate out of the state or stall in the so-called “valley of death” between innovation and commercialization. Industry experts agree the voluntary carbon market alone cannot scale CDR solutions sufficiently by mid-century, in part because the vast majority — 80% — of voluntary credits to date have been <a href=\"https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards\">contracted by a single corporate buyer</a> — Microsoft. Public policy-driven demand is indispensable for meeting California’s climate goals and demonstrating leadership that other states can emulate.</p><h3>California Must Act Now</h3><p>Newsom’s support for this year’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/19/governor-newsom-signs-historic-package-of-bipartisan-legislation-saving-billions-on-electric-bills-stabilizing-gas-market-and-cutting-pollution/\">climate legislation package</a> underscores the strategic importance of <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/10/carbon-management-coming-soon-to-california-governor-newsom-signs-legislation-paving-way-for-climate-pollution-cutting-technology/\">carbon management</a> (which includes CDR) to California’s economy. A back-of-the-envelope estimate (assuming about $100/ton of carbon dioxide) suggests CDR could become an $8 billion industry in California by 2045, if the state achieves the ambitious goal of removing 75 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The California Air Resources Board (CARB), the state's environmental regulator, is charged with deploying pathways and market mechanisms to realize this abatement wedge with high-quality CDR — an imperative that calls for proactive use of currently available funds in the <a href=\"https://www.caclimateinvestments.ca.gov/about-cci\">Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund </a>(GGRF) for climate technology innovation under SB 840 to signal demand immediately.</p><p>If the California budget allocated a portion of the GGRF slated for climate innovation technologies explicitly toward CDR procurement, it would provide a necessary market foundation. The legislature could require that this immediate demand signal be matched by private investment, unlocking capital for developers and yielding valuable lessons to inform ongoing protocol and regulatory development. In 2026, the legislature should consider multi-year appropriations to ensure there is continuous funding available to support CDR deployment, building on any funding already allocated in fiscal year 2026-2027.</p><p>In implementing a CDR program through the GGRF, CARB should follow the guidelines that were included in the vetoed SB 643 bill, including supporting a diverse portfolio of high-quality CDR approaches, ensuring that CDR results in long-term carbon sequestration, requiring community benefits, and ensuring that any use of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/sustainable-biomass-carbon-removal\">biomass</a> is limited to responsibly sourced wastes or residues. After all, California’s legislature overwhelmingly endorsed these safeguards when it passed SB 643.</p><p>California stands at a pivotal crossroads: Equipped with policy frameworks, legislative momentum and a vibrant CDR ecosystem, it now needs decisive and immediate public sector action to translate intent into impact. The clock is ticking toward CARB’s target to remove 7 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2030, and the state must act to meet its net-zero goals and secure its leadership in scalable, durable carbon removal.</p><p>How California leads in this space will also signal opportunity for what other states and nations can do, helping shape the global future of safe and high-quality CDR.</p><p><em>Deepika Nagabhushan is a senior policy researcher at </em><a href=\"https://project2030.blog/\"><em>Project2030</em></a><em> where she conceptualizes new approaches for carbon dioxide removal deployment in California that empower the local public and enable California to exceed its 2030 and 2045 climate targets.</em></p>",

While there are many ways to meet our protein needs, not all protein sources have the same impact on people or the planet. Beef and lamb, in particular, have some of the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered\">highest environmental costs</a> of any protein-rich food — with significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water pollution per ounce of protein than most alternatives.</p><p>\"The good news is that it’s entirely possible to eat a healthy, protein-adequate diet high in plant-based foods. Beans, lentils, soy, nuts, and seeds are great sources of protein and often other important nutrients such as fiber and iron while being far better for the planet than foods like beef and lamb.</p><p>\"Climate-conscious consumers and food businesses have more and more options for which protein-rich foods to prioritize. With so many good plant-based options available today, choosing less resource-intensive proteins is an easy and practical step people can take for both themselves and the climate.”</p>",

In Indonesia, the world’s largest nickel producer, annual production reached <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nickel-production-by-country\">2.2 million tons</a> and accounted for <a href=\"https://wri-indonesia.org/en/news/ministry-national-development-planning-ppnbappenas-and-wri-indonesia-ensure-integration-nickel\">22% of national emissions</a> from the energy and industrial sectors in 2023.

The government’s <a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/future-indonesia-s-green-industrial-policy\">commitment to decarbonizing nickel production</a> stems from Indonesia’s aspiration to become a green leader by supplying the minerals needed for the clean energy transition. Decarbonizing nickel production would help attract investment in domestic processing and manufacturing, position Indonesia for long-term competitiveness in the fast-growing battery and EV markets, and reduce the local environmental and health impacts associated with coal-based production.</p><p>Home to the world's largest nickel reserves, Indonesia produced nearly two-thirds of global raw nickel (mine production) in 2024, exceeding the combined output of all other producers. The Philippines, the second-largest producer, contributed about 9% of global output.  </p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Indonesia’s Nickel Dominance</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Indonesia's nickel industry consists of two subsectors: mining and processing. The country’s rise to market dominance accelerated after a 2020 ban on exports of unprocessed nickel ore. From 2015 to 2019, Indonesian accounted for between 15% and 33% of global nickel mine production, producing roughly <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/myb/vol3/2019/myb3-2019-indonesia.pdf\">one-third of the world’s mined nickel</a> by 2019. It was already the world’s largest producer before doubling its share following the 2020 export ban.</p><p class=\"secondary\">The export ban was part of a broader industrial strategy aimed at increasing domestic value from mineral wealth, attracting investment in smelting capacity, creating jobs and building an industrial base. Combined with surging global nickel prices, the export ban attracted significant Chinese investment in nickel processing facilities in Indonesia. </p></div><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26894852/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Many of Indonesia's nickel processing facilities are located in remote areas with limited energy infrastructure and rely on coal-based power to supply the massive amounts of energy required to process laterite nickel ore. Indonesia has 55 nickel processing facilities in operation. The vast majority, 90%, use smelting, a process that melts ore into metal at extremely high temperatures. The remaining 10% use a chemical process known as leaching.  The smelting process is the largest source of carbon emissions in Indonesia’s nickel industry, accounting for 97.9% of the sector’s total emissions, or 170.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. </p><p>In nickel smelting, the final production stage uses electric furnaces to convert ore into metal. The electricity used to power these furnaces accounts for <a href=\"https://perpustakaan.bappenas.go.id/e-library/file_upload/koleksi/dokumenbappenas/konten/Dokumen%202025/Konten/(ENG)%20Decarbonization%20Roadmap%20of%20Indonesia%20Nickel%20Industry_Translate.pdf\">more than 60% of total energy use</a> in the production process, and nearly all of it, 97%, comes from coal-fired power plants built and operated by the nickel industry outside the national grid. The scale of electricity demand in the nickel industry is huge: In 2023, it consumed about 100 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity — enough to power 10 million U.S. homes for a year, or roughly 80% of all household electricity use in Indonesia.</p><p>These numbers underscore the need to prioritize decarbonizing Indonesia’s nickel sector. Since these emissions come from a relatively small and identifiable number of industrial sites, they present a major climate opportunity. Targeting action at just a handful of facilities could achieve substantial emissions reductions.</p><h3>A Tale of Two Smelters </h3><p>Only one smelter in Indonesia operates primarily on renewable energy: a facility in Sorowako, South Sulawesi, powered by three hydropower plants with a combined capacity of 365 megawatts. Like many nickel smelters, the facility initially relied on coal power but gradually transitioned to hydropower, seeking a cheaper and more reliable long-term option, as hydropower offers greater supply certainty than coal. Following the transition, the facility reduced production costs by 40% per ton of nickel while eliminating 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions each year. In addition to powering the smelter, the hydropower plants generate an extra 8 megawatts of electricity used by the local community.</p><p>In Morowali, Central Sulawesi, the situation is markedly different. The region produces about one-third of Indonesia's nickel, and over the past decade the number of smelters has increased tenfold. But renewable energy adoption has stalled. Facilities have installed only small-scale solutions, such as rooftop solar panels for offices and lighting. Larger projects have been proposed, including a <a href=\"https://www.petromindo.com/news/article/sesna-to-start-255-mwp-solar-project-for-nickel-industries-1\">255-megawatt solar facility</a>, but timelines for construction and operation remain uncertain.  </p><p>What explains the contrast between Sorowako's success and Morowali's struggles? Two factors stand out: proximity and regulation.</p><p>Sorowako's smelter was developed with renewable energy in mind and is located near hydropower sources. In contrast, most smelters in Morowali were built far from substantial renewable energy potential and national grid infrastructure. This distance creates immediate logistical challenges. Building transmission lines requires large upfront capital investments with slow returns, reducing the financial attractiveness of renewable energy projects.  </p><p>However, the barriers extend beyond economics. Distance also introduces significant regulatory challenges. Companies would need to build transmission lines through natural forests, navigating lengthy forest-use permits and land acquisition processes. Even when firms are willing to absorb these costs, they still face constraints related to Indonesia’s state-run electricity monopoly, PLN.  </p><p>Morowali isn't an isolated case. Much of Indonesia's nickel industry faces similar constraints. In North Maluku, another major production hub, facilities are located even farther from reliable renewable energy resources and lack access to national energy infrastructure, particularly transmission lines.</p><p>Replicating Sorowako’s transition will not be straightforward. However, these barriers can be overcome. Infrastructure and policies can evolve. The key question is how to enable that transition at scale.  </p><h3> Decarbonization Pathways for Indonesia’s Nickel Industry</h3><p>In response to these challenges, the Indonesian government’s decarbonization roadmap for the nickel industry focuses on two core areas: transitioning to clean energy and improving production efficiency. </p><h4>Powering with Clean Energy </h4><p>To enable the energy transition in nickel smelters, the roadmap proposes three key elements: clear development plans, an attractive investment ecosystem and government financing support.</p><p>The development plans vary by region and are tailored to local conditions. In Sulawesi, an on-grid model is the most viable option. The region already has grid infrastructure and significant renewable energy potential, including hydroelectric resources in Central Sulawesi, wind resources in the south and widely distributed solar potential. The priority is to extend the grid to connect smelters and convert this resource potential into operational renewable energy projects capable of supplying clean power to the industry. By 2045, the <a href=\"https://perpustakaan.bappenas.go.id/e-library/file_upload/koleksi/dokumenbappenas/konten/Dokumen%202025/Konten/(ENG)%20Decarbonization%20Roadmap%20of%20Indonesia%20Nickel%20Industry_Translate.pdf\">roadmap targets an electricity mix</a> for the nickel industry of 61% hydropower, 30% solar power and 9% wind power to achieve the overarching goal of an 81% emissions reduction.</p><p>The roadmap’s other regional focus is North Maluku, which hosts a nickel industry comparable in scale to Sulawesi. Decarbonization faces distinct challenges there. The industrial parks are spread across the smaller islands of Halmahera and Obi, which lack existing grid infrastructure and large rivers for hydropower generation. The only viable clean energy sources are solar and wind, but both face land constraints. As a result, an off-grid model is more practical: Industrial parks will need to develop their own clean energy systems, potentially including green hydrogen power plants, to stay on track with decarbonization targets.</p><p>Developing these projects will require making them financially viable. At present, PLN, Indonesia’s state-owned electricity utility, caps renewable electricity prices at levels too low to attract sufficient investment. However, simply raising prices could discourage smelters from purchasing PLN-supplied power. To address this, the roadmap proposes an optimized pricing structure: increase solar and wind tariffs by 30% to 50% to improve investment incentives, while reducing hydropower prices by 40% to reflect existing cost competitiveness. Together, these adjustments would result in an estimated 10% increase in PLN’s industrial electricity tariffs — enough to enable renewable projects without imposing significant additional costs on smelters.</p><p>Pricing alone won't resolve the infrastructure challenge. Grid expansion faces a fundamental financing constraint: Transmission infrastructure offers low returns on investment, making it unattractive to private investors. Government support is therefore critical. The roadmap calls for financing guarantees and co-investment to reduce risk. It also recommends regulatory reforms to enhance business certainty through a more transparent and efficient permitting process, better integration with regional spatial planning and greater flexibility for private developer participation. Together, these measures would create a more attractive environment for clean energy investment.</p><h4>Cleaning the Process</h4><p>Fuel combustion is used at different stages of the smelting process. While the final smelting stage relies on electricity to heat furnaces and melt ore into metal, earlier stages — ore drying and calcination — rely on fuel combustion, typically by burning coal to heat the material before it enters the electric furnace. </p><p>These fuel-based stages represent another critical piece of the decarbonization puzzle. They account for <a href=\"https://perpustakaan.bappenas.go.id/e-library/file_upload/koleksi/dokumenbappenas/konten/Dokumen%202025/Konten/(ENG)%20Decarbonization%20Roadmap%20of%20Indonesia%20Nickel%20Industry_Translate.pdf\">one-third of total emissions</a> and, as a result, offer more feasible near-term decarbonization options than the power transition alone. The quickest gains come from efficiency improvements.</p><p>This starts with controlling ore quality, since lower-quality ore requires more energy to process. Facilities can also capture and recycle waste heat into earlier production stages. Some facilities have already adopted these practices with clear benefits for both their bottom line and carbon footprint. For example, smelters in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, and Kolaka, South Sulawesi, incorporated waste heat recovery systems at the design stage, reducing energy use in the heating process by 10% and 25%, respectively. The roadmap calls for clearer policies and targets to accelerate adoption of these technologies across the industry. </p><p>But efficiency improvements alone won't be enough. The roadmap also identifies fuel and material substitution as key decarbonization measures. Coal used directly in smelters can be replaced by natural gas as a transition fuel, before cleaner options like hydrogen become viable. On the materials side, auxiliary inputs, including reducing agents such as semicoke and anthracite, can be replaced with biochar produced from agricultural waste.</p><p>Cost remains a barrier. The government already caps and subsidizes natural gas prices for several industrial sectors, including heavy industries such as steel. Extending this policy to nickel would enable a shift away from coal at manageable cost to the industry. For biochar, price is not the only challenge. Supply remains volatile, and quality is often inconsistent. Addressing these constraints will require national supply chain development, particularly large-scale processing facilities run by state-owned enterprises. Creating this scale would help stabilize supply and ensure consistent quality across the industry.</p><h3>The Road Ahead for Responsible Nickel</h3><p>Indonesia has demonstrated that critical mineral producers can build domestic processing industries rather than simply exporting raw materials. The next challenge is to show that industrial development and climate goals can advance together. The decarbonization roadmap offers a blueprint for this transition, setting targets and outlining policies and collective actions needed to overcome financial, technical and regulatory barriers.</p><p>Given Indonesia's concentrated nickel supply and growing global demand, how the country manages this transition has implications beyond its borders. Progress on decarbonization is likely to influence standards for responsible nickel production worldwide, particularly in China, which faces similar challenges in its nickel industry. The real test now is implementation: turning the roadmap's vision into tangible change across the sector.</p><p>Ultimately, decarbonizing nickel is not just about supporting the energy transition. It's about ensuring that everyday goods, from electronics to household products, are produced responsibly without further fueling climate change. </p><p>  </p>",

They're also needed to build solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and other clean technologies increasingly powering our daily lives. This is a big part of the reason demand is booming today.</p><p>While 60 minerals are considered \"critical\" by the U.S. Geological Survey, around <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/critical-minerals-us-climate-goals\">10 are essential to the clean energy transition</a>, including lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, aluminum and zinc.</p><p><a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/10/securing-americas-critical-minerals-supply?lang=en\">Recent analysis</a> suggests that demand for certain critical minerals will far outstrip the United States' domestic supply in the coming years. For instance, the U.S. is expected to produce around 28,000 metric tons of lithium in 2035. But demand could reach over 100,000 metric tons — more than triple this output.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26609883/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>How the country will meet this need is an urgent question.

This poses challenges to supply chain security. For example, <a href=\"https://www.mining-technology.com/analyst-comment/china-global-rare-earth-production/\">China controls</a> 70% of global rare earth mining and 90% of refining and has leveraged this dominance as a political tool by restricting exports to the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/from-scrap-to-supply-circular-strategies-for-critical-minerals\">metal recycling</a> may be able to help meet domestic demand in the future, scaling up mining will be necessary in the near term.</p><p>Both recent federal administrations have seen critical mineral supply chains as a key priority and taken steps to shore up <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/us-critical-minerals-dilemma-what-know\">domestic production</a>. For instance, the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act provided <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221462962400152X?via%3Dihub\">incentives</a> for critical mineral production through the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. (This was amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to include a phaseout by 2034.)</p><p>In March 2025, President Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/\">executive order</a> to \"facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.\" This order created a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-administration-advances-first-wave-of-critical-mineral-production-projects/\">list of priority</a> critical minerals projects and invoked the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-defense-production-act\">Defense Production Act</a> to expedite permitting processes on federal lands.

If not managed responsibly, these projects can come with significant environmental and social risks for nearby communities.</p><p>For one, mining waste can contaminate local water supplies. Some extraction methods also <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/critical-minerals-mining-water-impacts\">require significant amounts of water</a>. This can lead to conflicts, particularly in agricultural communities where water is already scarce. Mining activities can also damage wildlife habitat and biodiversity and pollute the air.</p><p>Hell's Kitchen, for example, would operate in a part of California already grappling with water scarcity, water pollution, and air pollution that drives <a href=\"https://californiaagriculture.org/article/108636\">high rates of asthma</a>. Several environmental groups have voiced worries that the project would put further strain on water supplies, <a href=\"https://earthworks.org/releases/groups-defending-health-and-environment-file-appeal-challenging-hells-kitchen-lithium-project-ruling/\">worsen air quality</a> and generate hazardous waste.</p><p>In addition, mining can lead to economic booms and busts if a community becomes overly reliant on a single, non-renewable industry. For small communities, a major influx of workers can overwhelm local roads, services and housing, <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-framework-for-federal-mining-reform-impact-planning-benefits-sharing-and-asset-based-revenue-management/\">increasing traffic and straining public infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Tribal Nations and Native communities have been <a href=\"https://news.unm.edu/news/native-communities-hit-hard-by-mining-legacy\">disproportionately impacted</a> by the mining sector in the past and are especially exposed to new critical mineral mines. An <a href=\"https://www.msci.com/research-and-insights/blog-post/mining-energy-transition-metals-national-aims-local-conflicts\">analysis of U.S. mineral reserves</a> found that a high percentage — 97% for nickel, 89% for copper, 79% for lithium and 68% for cobalt — are located within 35 miles of Native American reservations. Although not necessarily located on reservations themselves, the reserves are often located on land that has cultural, ancestral and historic significance, placing many tribal communities in the direct path of new mining operations.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221462962400152X?via%3Dihub\">Some experts</a> have pointed out that the recent increase in domestic critical mineral production has already reignited historic <a

involve local communities in the development process. Many left the surrounding area worse off economically and environmentally. This has left many communities <a href=\"https://media.rff.org/documents/WP_25-08_PHBFNYf.pdf\">feeling ignored or betrayed</a> by companies and, in some cases, the government.</p><p>As a result, new mines in the U.S. often face significant local pushback. This can lead to litigation, long project delays or even cancellation, as well as reputational damage for companies. Several critical mineral projects in the U.S. are facing such opposition today.</p><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/overview/default.aspx\">Thacker Pass</a> mine in Nevada — expected to be a major source of lithium for EV batteries — has faced legal challenges from the Numu/Nuwu and Newe (Northern Paiute and Western Shoshone) and environmental groups over water use and potential groundwater contamination. They've also raised concerns about the lack of <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-report-finds-nevadas-lithium-mine-permit-violates-indigenous-peoples-rights\">free, prior and informed consent</a> for local Tribes and limiting access to culturally significant land.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"884\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"707\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"542\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"427\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"255\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A billboard in the desert protesting a lithium mine.\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-12/thacker-pass-mine-protest-billboard_0.jpg?VersionId=A90WEbBR.G.qgw4lCrGLClSzjxPXhF16&itok=ZJgCJMRX\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A billboard protesting the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, which has drawn concerns from environmental groups, Native American tribes and local ranchers.

Environmental groups argued that the environmental impact report failed to analyze and mitigate <a href=\"https://earthworks.org/releases/groups-defending-health-and-environment-file-appeal-challenging-hells-kitchen-lithium-project-ruling/\">concerns around air quality</a> and hazardous waste, and that <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JO1YgXU_cxYNh2ZkZKudbERcaf3Y7Heg/view\">local agencies did not consult</a> with <a href=\"https://ccvhealth.org/site/hells-kitchen\">local Tribes</a> — including Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, Kwaaymii Laguna Band of Indians and Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians — as required by law.</p><p>It is worth noting that local support or opposition can vary significantly, and no Tribe or community is a monolith.</p><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://blackbuttecopper.com/\">Black Butte</a> copper mine has faced multiple <a href=\"https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-black-butte-copper-project-permit\">lawsuits</a> from environmental groups due to concerns that the project was granted permits based on insufficient environmental impact reviews. Yet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yokDbpugFuk\">some residents</a> welcome the project for its potential to create new jobs in the area.</p><p>In the case of Hell's Kitchen, some of the groups that brought about the 2024 lawsuit have stated that they are <a href=\"https://earthworks.org/releases/groups-defending-health-and-environment-file-appeal-challenging-hells-kitchen-lithium-project-ruling/\">not necessarily against the development</a> of the mine, seeing it as an opportunity for new jobs and other local benefits. However, they want the project to <a href=\"https://valleunido.org/2024/12/02/ending-the-cycle-of-resource-extraction-valle-unido-coalition-charts-a-pathway-forward-to-a-community-centered-lithium-valley/\">commit to ensuring good jobs and a healthy environment</a> while respecting Indigenous rights and protecting Tribal resources.</p><h3>Strategies for Robust Community Engagement</h3><p>There is no silver bullet to address mining's impacts. But there are many ways governments and companies can tangibly improve the sector, and meaningful community engagement is a critical foundation. Below we outline three strategies that can help encourage local engagement, mitigate harms, and lead to positive outcomes for communities hosting critical minerals projects:</p><h4>1) Securing real benefits for communities through benefits-sharing agreements</h4><p>New mines are often billed as an opportunity for nearby communities. But they don't always deliver. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/community-benefits-frameworks-database-takeaways\">Benefits-sharing frameworks</a> — such as community benefits agreement (CBAs), good neighbor agreements (GNAs) or <a href=\"https://www.tallgrassinstitute.org/articles/tallgrass-institute-releases-tribal-benefit-agreements-report-new-research-examines-best-practices\">Tribal Benefit Agreements</a> (TBAs) — can help.</p><p>These are voluntary but legally binding mechanisms between project developers and local communities that help ensure mines avoid harm and bring real benefits to local people. When designed well, they can help foster trust, address local concerns and enable groups to hold project developers accountable, while also curbing opposition to new projects.</p><p>The Stillwater Mine <a href=\"https://northernplains.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FinalCopy_GNA_2016_12_9.pdf\">Good Neighbor Agreement</a> in Montana is a strong example. The GNA establishes water quality metrics that are more stringent than state and federal requirements and incorporates rigorous monitoring to ensure compliance. The mining company, <a href=\"https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/\">Sibanye-Stillwater</a>, funds independent environmental performance audits each year. The GNA also established processes for local groups to monitor mine operations, access data, conduct inspections, and weigh in on mine plans and permit revisions, fostering trust and transparency.</p><p>The Stillwater agreement also takes a robust approach to dispute resolution. Its multi-tiered process starts with good faith negotiation, moves to binding arbitration by a neutral third party if talks fail, and ultimately allows for civil enforcement in court to uphold the contract. Thanks to this, there has been no arbitration or litigation around the Stillwater mine since the GNA came into effect in 2000.</p><p>Despite its successes, some advocates have pointed out that Stillwater's GNA does not go beyond mitigating potential harms to deliver broader community benefits. Benefits-sharing agreements are considered most effective when they also secure things like direct job guarantees or infrastructure investments that ensure long-term community well-being.</p><p>Stillwater has inspired similar agreements, including one being negotiated for the <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/27996/chapter/4\">Black Butte Copper</a> mine in Montana. In the case of Hell's Kitchen, a coalition of local nonprofits has <a href=\"https://valleunido.org/2024/12/02/ending-the-cycle-of-resource-extraction-valle-unido-coalition-charts-a-pathway-forward-to-a-community-centered-lithium-valley/\">called for a community benefits agreement</a> \"to strike a balance for community prosperity and environmental protection.\"</p><p>Some mining companies have successfully engaged communities without signing a formal benefits-sharing agreement. Eagle Mine, the only primary nickel producer in the country, initially faced organized opposition. But its operators <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420725003022\">created formal procedures</a> to engage with local groups that gradually overcame this pushback. The company created a \"community environmental monitoring program\" and invested in the local economy and education. Lundin Mining, the current operator, has also developed a <a href=\"https://www.eaglemine.com/post/have-your-say-about-eagle-mine\">voluntary community monitoring system</a>; it uses a third-party organization to survey community sentiment toward the mine every six months, which is incorporated into its decision-making.</p><p>However, this kind of voluntary corporate engagement remains the exception rather than the norm. And it doesn't offer tools to hold companies accountable. Because of this, legally binding agreements are seen as a more effective option. They can empower communities to secure specific, long-term benefits and provide a more structured and reliable approach to development.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Road sign that reads \"Welcome to White Sulphur Springs.\" \" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-12/white-sulphur-springs-mt-sign_0.jpg?VersionId=WtttLy3M4XtgrMHZQ6aBc_7YBKJdD_1B&h=41f55a5b&itok=GbO6xQuV\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The city of White Sulphur Springs, Mont., and surrounding county received $437,000 to help cover public costs during the construction of the nearby Black Butte Copper Mine. Photo by Cheri Alguire/Shutterstock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>2) Improving regulation to give communities a seat at the table</h4><p>Most states require mining companies to obtain various permits that involve mandatory public notice and comment periods. This gives community members a chance to provide input to state agencies.</p><p>However, Montana has gone a step further: Its Hard Rock Mining Impact Act (HRMIA) is <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-framework-for-federal-mining-reform-impact-planning-benefits-sharing-and-asset-based-revenue-management/\">considered unique</a> in that it gives communities formal standing and leverage to address mining impacts.</p><p>HRMIA requires any developer of a large-scale hard rock mine to prepare <a href=\"https://commerce.mt.gov/About/Boards/Hard-Rock-Mining-Impact-Board/Hard-Rock-Impact-Plan-Information\">an impact plan</a> that describes its expected social and economic impacts on local government entities — such as counties, cities and school districts — who can then negotiate with the mining company for funding to address them. This might include money for things like new infrastructure, public health services or road maintenance. In 2020, for example, Meagher County and the City of White Sulphur Springs <a href=\"https://sandfireamerica.com/document/black-butte-copper-project-update/\">received $437,000</a> from <a href=\"https://blackbuttecopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Community-Presentation-5.17.23.pdf\">Black Butte copper mine's developer</a>. This kind of upfront funding is intended to address infrastructure and service needs and financial gaps before the expanded tax base from the mining operation begins to provide revenue.</p><p>Montana created a <a href=\"https://commerce.mt.gov/About/Boards/Hard-Rock-Mining-Impact-Board/\">Hard Rock Mining Impact Board</a> that reviews impact plans for compliance and can adjudicate disputes between local governments and companies. The five-member board balances local government, community, industry and finance interests by mandating that at least three members must be from an area affected by large-scale mining development, one member from the hard rock mining industry, and one from a major financial institution in the state.</p><p>A companion law, the Property Tax Base Sharing Act, ensures that 35% of metal mines tax revenues are allocated to local governments to mitigate the fiscal impacts of mining operations. The state law also requires counties to place at least 37.5% of that allocation into a designated savings account: a \"rainy-day\" fund to be used in the event of a mine shutdown or major workforce reduction.</p><p>Montana's framework, especially its provisions for mitigating local fiscal and infrastructure impacts from large mines, can be a model for other states and the federal government.</p><h4>3) Leveraging third-party sustainability frameworks</h4><p>Voluntary, third-party sustainability frameworks — such as <a href=\"https://responsiblemining.net/\">the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance</a> (IRMA) and <a href=\"https://coppermark.org/\">The Copper Mark</a> — can be powerful tools for any project looking to demonstrate a commitment to industry best practices. These frameworks ensure responsible mining by setting rigorous standards for environmental and social performance; providing independent verification; increasing transparency; and building trust among stakeholders, such as communities, buyers and investors.</p><p>Frameworks also provide common standards for community engagement, including proactively identifying and engaging with vulnerable and Tribal stakeholders, documenting input received from communities and addressing their concerns. And they include independent assessments of whether a mine is meeting relevant requirements. While <a href=\"https://rue.bmz.de/resource/blob/246794/250127-bmz-rue-synegies-vss-study-rz-web-en.pdf\">not a substitute for strong government regulation</a>, if used well, these frameworks can help identify and mitigate sustainability risks and improve relations with the local community.</p><p>Yet uptake is limited, including in the U.S. IRMA, considered by some to be the most rigorous sustainability framework, has not independently assessed a single mine in the United States to date. Copper Mark is an exception; it has been awarded to 11 out of 25 operating copper mines in the U.S., which is significant.</p><p>With an estimated 280 metal mines operating in the U.S., there's substantial potential to expand the use of voluntary sustainability frameworks. By increasing their reach, these frameworks could play a critical role in raising the performance of the U.S. mining sector, particularly in areas like meaningful and equitable community engagement.</p><h3>Moving Forward</h3><p>These strategies offer concrete pathways for the U.S. to build a more responsible mining industry.

      "description": "<p>Now is the time of year when everyone thinks about what they'd like to change about themselves. Despite the museum of abandoned aspirations behind us — the language-learning app that now just judges us in three different languages, the journal whose one lonely entry reads 'Day 1: This is the year!' — we embrace resolutions each January with the cheerful confidence of someone who has never met their past self.</p><p>This seems bleak, but here's a secret I've learned as a behavioral scientist: Past failures aren't always our fault — at least not entirely.</p><p>There's only so much control we all have over our own lives. Sure, sometimes failure is the product of workaday laziness. But often we blame the player when we should (at least partly) <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-impact-behavior-shifts\">blame the game</a>.</p><h3>Why New Year's Resolutions Often Fail</h3><p>There is a simple equation from social psychologist Kurt Lewin that explains almost everything you need to know about why our new year's resolutions often fail and what to do about it:</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>B = f(P,E)</em></p><p>Where \"B,\" behavior, is a function of \"P,\" the person,<em> and</em> \"E,\" their environment.</p><p>Individual behaviors are literally part of the equation, but they are shaped by systems — by policies, by industry, by the circumstances in which we live. Personal choices matter, of course. But our ability to execute our choices is heavily influenced by the environment around us. (I explore this topic in depth in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-impact-behavior-shifts\">my research</a> published earlier this year.)</p><p>Take bike riding. With intentions of sustainable transport, I bought an electric bike. I ride it a fair amount, and I love it. But I don't use it as much as I'd like because there are very few protected lanes in my neighborhood. So, when I reach for my bike, fueled with good intentions (the P force in the equation), I can feel my wind-in-the-hair ambitions riding directly into my fear of the cars that drive along next to me (the E in the equation). My desire to keep my bones in their current structure wins, and I reach for car keys instead of my bike.</p><p>So, should we all abandon our new year's resolutions because personal change is impossible without systemic change? Of course not! While it's tempting to surrender to forces beyond our control, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-friendly-choices-ranked\">individual choices</a> remain powerful; they're literally half of Lewin's equation.</p><p>Our individual choices are seeds of change. Like any seed, they require an ecosystem of supporting conditions to flourish. The key is working both dimensions: designing our micro-environments while advocating for macro systems that nurture larger change. Think of it as both planting seeds and improving soil conditions — neither alone suffices, but together they create the conditions for success.</p><article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7pMehDJqPw\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch Sustainable Behavior Shifts: The Missing Piece\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Making Sustainable New Year's Resolutions a Reality</h3><p>There are lots of ways people can make healthier choices for themselves and the planet. Part of being successful is choosing wisely. There is a cartoon that captures this insight. Two blue whales are talking, and one says, \"My new year's resolution is to lose 38,000 pounds.\"</p><p>Start too big or with too many goals, and we will lose confidence and then traction. We aim for whale-sized goals when goldfish-sized beginnings serve us better. The trick is picking the right goals and making sure they are right-sized.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1013\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"810\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"620\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"489\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"293\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People bagging produce at a farmer's market stall.\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2024-12/farmers-market.jpg?VersionId=MjIYsVk1vBMa0G8tqKClSOXCjucWUQbd&itok=aD4BTzDV\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Shoppers bag produce at a farmer's market. Eating less meat and more plant-based protein is one impactful way to lower your climate footprint. Photo by SochAnam/iStock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>There are many relatively simple changes that can make a positive impact on the climate. And <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-impact-behavior-shifts\">some matter much more than others</a>.</p><p>Biking or walking instead of driving a gas-powered car can reduce carbon emissions and local air pollution. Plant-based diets are less resource-intensive than meat-based ones — especially red meat. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered\">Beef production</a>, for example, requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times the greenhouse gases per gram of edible protein than common plant-based options like beans. And reducing food waste can curb planet-warming methane emissions while also saving households money.</p><p>Those who resolve to take up healthy and sustainable behavior changes can make them easier and more likely by using the <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/publications/east-four-simple-ways-to-apply-behavioural-insights/\"><strong>EAST framework</strong></a>:</p><ul><li>Keep the behavior <strong>easy</strong>, so it takes minimal effort to do;</li><li>Keep the behavior <strong>attractive</strong>, so there are incentives built in;</li><li>Keep the behavior <strong>social</strong>, so you see other people doing the same; and</li><li>Keep the behavior<strong> timely</strong>, so you experience a benefit right away.</li></ul><p>If your goal is to take public transit more instead of driving, the EAST framework might involve easing friction by auto-loading fare cards, pre-programing routes, and adding smart alerts that make sure you get to the bus or metro on time.</p><p>You might make this behavior attractive by downloading podcasts and investing in decent headphones. Sharing the commute with a colleague can make it more fun and help you stick to your commitment. Finally, creating immediate rewards can reinforce your choice. That favorite coffee shop near your stop becomes a daily bright spot, while tracking your gas savings provides instant gratification.</p><h3>Creating a Healthier Planet Requires Personal Choice<em> and</em> Systemic Shifts</h3><p>I am an applied behavioral scientist who works on pro-climate behaviors. If anyone should be able to build a healthy and sustainable practice, it's me. Armed with the EAST framework and determination, I crafted what seemed like the perfect sustainable transportation plan: an electric bike chosen for ease, a really comfortable seat for attraction, shared rides with my daughter for social connection. Yet despite this carefully engineered situation, I find myself reaching for my car keys (an EV, but still) more often than I'd like. I did what I could, but now I need policymakers in Washington, D.C., where I live, to invest in protected bike lanes. I can change my habits, but I can't redesign my streets — at least, not without engaging with the systems that shape our urban landscape.</p><p>That's why personal actions like voting and consumer advocacy are also critical: to ensure that bigger institutions like governments and businesses are acting in the best interests of people, nature and the climate.</p><p>Just as our abandoned language apps might judge us in three languages, the climate judges our collective (in)action in countless ways. But this time could be different — not because we've changed, but because we finally understand that we've been missing half the equation. Maybe this is the year we reframe our resolutions through Lewin's elegant equation and see that personal change and planetary survival share the same winning formula: where B = f(P,E) adds up to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/1-5-degrees-c-target-explained\">thwarting climate change</a>, and aligning individual will with systemic support may just save the planet.</p><p><em>This article was first published on Dec. 23, 2024.

It houses more than <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x\">one-fifth of all mangroves</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718310751\">5% of seagrass meadows</a> on the planet — ecosystems that are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-is-blue-carbon-benefits-for-people-planet\">critical to storing carbon</a> and buffering against climate change impacts. The country also relies heavily on the ocean for transportation, tourism, food and myriad other necessities.</p><p>Targeted action in these areas — from restoring coastal ecosystems to electrifying marine transport — could help tackle planet-warming emissions while also uplifting Indonesia's economy and allowing nature to flourish. We're seeing glimmers of progress already: Like many countries, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-indonesia-submits-its-national-climate-commitment-new-emissions-targets-ahead-cop30\">Indonesia's new climate plan</a> attempts to put a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-more-coastal-and-island-countries-include-ocean-action-climate-plans-biggest-climate\">stronger emphasis on the ocean</a> than previous commitments.</p><p>However, these plans still aren't nearly as ambitious as they could be. And they overlook some of the most impactful areas for action. Without remedying these gaps, Indonesia could miss major opportunities for tackling climate change — and the chance to emerge as a global ocean leader.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A group of high school students planting mangrove seedlings on a sunny day.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-12/mangrove-planting-sumba-indonesia_0.jpg?VersionId=nZDJUWlTJqnHCsEO5y8yOZAfFjDnmPcQ&itok=Vgifa9qQ\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Mangrove planting in Sumba, Indonesia. Coastal ecosystems like mangroves help curb climate change by absorbing vast amount of carbon.

This is mainly because they can store large amounts of carbon in their biomass and soil — up to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-is-blue-carbon-benefits-for-people-planet\">5 times more</a> than tropical forests over an equal area — for long periods. However, these ecosystems are rapidly succumbing to climate change, pollution, shoreline development and other threats, and few are protected.</p><p>By preventing mangrove deforestation and degradation, and by expanding restoration and reforestation, Indonesia could eliminate 32-41 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) annually by 2030. That's roughly equal to cutting out emissions from <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle\">10 million cars per year</a>. Including seagrasses in these measures could reduce an additional 17-60 MtCO2e per year by 2030.</p><h4>Maritime industry and infrastructure</h4><p>Maritime transport is crucial for Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of inhabited islands located along major global trade routes. The Strait of Malacca, which runs about 900 kilometers along northern Sumatra, is one of the world's busiest and most emissions-intensive shipping routes. It also contributes significantly to <a href=\"https://wri-indonesia.org/en/insights/7-things-know-about-jakartas-air-pollution-crisis\">air pollution</a> in Indonesia, where many cities already grapple with unhealthy air quality.</p><p>Yet this strategic position gives Indonesia a unique opportunity to lead the transition toward <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/how-to-decarbonize-international-shipping\">low-emissions international shipping</a>. Electrification and shifting to renewable energy in domestic marine transport could reduce emissions by 2.1-2.8 MtCO2e per year by 2030, while international shipping and port activities could cut an additional 10.3-13.9 MtCO2e.</p><h4>Offshore renewable energy</h4><p>Indonesia's population has grown rapidly over the past 30 years, driving more than a 230% increase in energy demand. And demand is expected to keep rising by almost 5% per year through 2030. To meet this need and support its clean energy transition, Indonesia has committed to expanding renewable energy by <a href=\"https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/05/16/new-taskforce-powers-indonesias-energy-transition/\">19%-21% by 2030</a>.</p><p>Offshore resources (including wind, wave, tidal and ocean thermal energy) can help meet Indonesia's renewable energy goal, providing the same low-emissions and clean air benefits as onshore renewables while avoiding land-use constraints. By 2030, wave, tidal, offshore wind and ocean thermal energy could cut Indonesia's emissions by 0.83 MtCO2e per year, with even greater potential by 2050.</p><p><strong>According to Climateworks Centre's analysis<sup>1</sup>, ocean-based action could deliver nearly half (49%) of additional emissions cuts needed in Indonesia by 2050 to align with holding warming to 1.5 degrees C. </strong>By comparison, ocean-based solutions could deliver <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-based-climate-change-solutions\">35% of the emissions reductions needed globally</a> over that period — showing the outsized role that the ocean can play in Indonesia's climate trajectory.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Underwater shot of mangrove roots with fish swimming among them.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-12/mangrove-roots_0.jpg?VersionId=hHxJc.daqL6.eu2XMGYv3jaUnyzfeW6s&h=3bcf01bb&itok=OIJXuINr\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Mangroves' root systems help to stabilize shorelines, protect coastal communities from erosion and storms, and provide habitat for wildlife. Photo by jafarsodik/Shutterstock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>It's Not Just About the Climate</h3><p>Fighting climate change isn't the only reason to invest in ocean solutions.</p><p>Efforts across the broader \"blue ecosystem\" can also <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/unlocking-potential-blue-carbon-ecosystems-national-climate-policy\">help Indonesia build resilience</a> to extreme weather. About 1,800 kilometers of the country's coastline is considered highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, with potential economic losses in the marine and coastal sector estimated at <a href=\"https://lcdi-indonesia.id/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0_Executive-Summary.pdf\">81.82 trillion Indonesian rupiah</a> ($5.16 billion) in 2024. Ecosystems like <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-1510.1\">mangroves help to stabilize shorelines</a> and dampen wave energy, buffering against storm surges, preventing erosion and shielding coastal communities from damage.</p><p>At the same time, a healthy ocean is essential to local economies and wellbeing, particularly in island nations like Indonesia. Protecting marine ecosystems can <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.671753/full\">support coastal livelihoods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.671753/full\">strengthen food security</a> and bolster local industries. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000062\">One study</a> shows that fish catches near mangroves can be up to 70% higher than in areas without them. Mangroves and seagrass also create opportunities for eco-tourism, providing direct economic benefits for local communities.</p><p>Ocean action can also fight poverty and inequality. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.ykan.or.id/en/publications/articles/perspectives/gender-inclusive-approach-to-mangrove-restoration/\">SECURE (Shrimp-Carbon Aquaculture) project</a> in East Kalimantan involves women's groups in restoring 50%-80% of the area's shrimp and milkfish ponds back to their original state as mangroves. In addition to boosting coastal resilience, the effort increases income and enhances women's roles in supporting their families. A socio-economic survey recorded a 12% income rise for aquaculture farmers and an average 40% increase for women's groups compared to the baseline.</p><h3>Current Policies Fall Well Short of This Potential</h3><p>Indonesia's government has formally recognized the importance of ocean-based climate actions for years, both within its national climate commitments (known as a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">nationally determined contributions</a>, or NDCs) and in its <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate/long-term-strategies/what-is-long-term-strategy\">long-term strategy</a> — the name for country plans that are meant to drive low-carbon and climate-resilient development through 2050.</p><p>But real-world progress is lagging.</p><p>To date, the ocean components of these plans have focused almost exclusively on mangrove restoration. Indonesia's last NDC (from 2022) committed to restore 600,000 hectares of mangroves by 2024. However, the country had only restored about 84,400 hectares (14% of the target) by the end of last year. The government terminated the Peat and Mangrove Restoration Agency, which was tasked with accelerating mangrove restoration in nine priority provinces, in early 2025. Indonesia has also faced financial and technical difficulties; the cost of mangrove restoration is <a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/89fd7ff87561a4a913ed3371278e7933-0070062022/related/The-Economics-of-Large-scale-Mangrove-Conservation-and-Restoration-in-Indonesia-Brief-Note-Interactive-220516.pdf\">often much higher</a> than other land-based restoration.</p><p>Efforts to protect and restore seagrass meadows are even further behind. Indonesia is still working to develop <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ocean_Panel_Blue_Carbon_Handbook-1.pdf\">carbon measurement</a> protocols for seagrass. Alongside a new national seagrass map launched in December 2025, this will serve as the baseline data for improving ecosystem management and measuring changes in emissions.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"884\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"707\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"542\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"427\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"255\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cranes load cargo ships at a busy port. \" height=\"255\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-12/jakarta-shipping-port_0.jpg?VersionId=fqp8DBBbfzEuXVQXWit8LM0QsFz7WEm.&itok=n163EpPG\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A busy port in Jakarta.

These regulations are a first step toward developing carbon pricing mechanisms for the ocean sector, such as carbon trading and results-based payments, that will support involvement in both domestic and international carbon markets. These mechanisms are expected to be implemented by governments as businesses as well as local communities, and could help mobilize financing toward achieving Indonesia's national climate goals.</p><p>Yet major gaps remain — and Indonesia's newest national climate plan, released in October 2025, does little to close them. The new NDC acknowledges the need to protect and sustainably use coastal ecosystems like mangroves, but does not lay out explicit targets or activities to support this. Nor does it establish an absolute emissions-reduction target for the ocean sector. And the potential contributions from activities beyond blue carbon ecosystems, such as marine transport or offshore renewable energy, have not been fully explored or quantified.</p><p>In addition, efforts to protect and manage mangroves remain categorized within the Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector only. This makes it difficult to coordinate ecosystem management and monitoring with other ministries, such as the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Marine and Fisheries Affairs, further hampering progress.</p><table class=\"table tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th>NDC Version</th><th>Ocean Sector Inclusion</th><th>Commitments for Ocean-Based Climate Actions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-09/23.09.2022_Enhanced%20NDC%20Indonesia.pdf\">Enhanced NDC</a> (2022)</td><td>Ocean sector is partially recognized by including mangrove ecosystem management and protection in climate mitigation (under the FOLU sector) and adaptation actions.</td><td>600,000 ha mangrove restoration by 2024</td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-10/Indonesia_Second%20NDC_2025.10.24.pdf\">Second NDC</a></p><p>(2025)</p></td><td>Similar to the Enhanced NDC, but with greater recognition of blue carbon potential, including seagrass alongside mangroves.</td><td>No explicit targets</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>How Can Indonesia Step Up Its Efforts?</h3><p>Indonesia's new climate commitment recognizes the value the ocean can bring for people, nature and the climate. And the country is taking steps in the right direction. But much more is possible — and needed.</p><p>The question now is how Indonesia can translate the immense promise of ocean-based climate solutions into real, rapid change.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Improve regulation and planning: </strong>The updated version of Indonesia's Second NDC (expected around 2027/2028) should establish a clear definition and scope for marine-based sectors, including what is meant by blue carbon and related ecosystems. It should also develop and adopt robust, science-based methodologies for measuring GHG emissions and reductions from mangroves, seagrasses and other blue carbon ecosystems, and ensure alignment with <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/4_Volume4/19R_V4_Ch07_Wetlands.pdf\">IPCC Wetlands guidance</a>. In addition, Indonesia needs to enhance its mangrove GHG inventory methods by integrating belowground biomass and accelerate national seagrass mapping, as well as the development of country-specific carbon measurement approaches.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Strengthen governance and coordination: </strong>Indonesia needs to strengthen integrated governance for the ocean sector to support its national climate commitments, ensuring that monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) processes are well coordinated across relevant ministries and institutions. It should also clearly define and harmonize the mandates of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Environment, and regional authorities to prevent overlap and streamline blue carbon ecosystem management. In addition, Indonesia should establish a legal framework that formally requires line ministries to contribute to NDC preparation, implementation and reporting.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Gather more robust data: </strong>Indonesia needs more robust data and methodologies to better understand how sectors like blue carbon, maritime industry and offshore renewable energy can contribute to climate goals, and to assess how impactful its actions are. The country should work on building technical capacity at national and local levels to support the development, refinement and application of emerging GHG calculation and MRV methodologies, particularly for seagrass carbon accounting. In addition, Indonesia must enhance data integration across agencies involved in ocean-based climate actions, ensuring that information is not fragmented or stored in silos. Harmonized datasets will enable consistent MRV and support reporting requirements under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p> </p></li><li><strong>Shift financial flows to support ocean action: </strong>Indonesia needs to provide clear guidance — through new regulations, technical standards or approved financial instruments — to help unlock diverse financing sources, including carbon markets, for ocean-climate initiatives. It should also invest in capacity-building programs to ensure local and national actors can meet the technical requirements of carbon accounting and verification. Finally, Indonesia must mobilize both public and private finance by improving regulatory certainty and demonstrating credible, quantifiable emissions-reduction potentials, enabling ocean-climate actions to be scaled up more effectively.</li></ul><p>Integrating ocean-based activities into climate commitments is not only about policy design, but also the ability to unlock finance, build local capacity, and deliver real and tangible climate benefits.</p><p><sup>1 Climateworks Centre evaluated how ocean-based mitigation could increase emissions reductions and help close the gap between two pathways in </sup><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Indonesia_LTS-LCCR_2021.pdf\"><sup>Indonesia's long-term strategy</sup></a><sup>: the Transition Scenario (which bridges the NDC's unconditional pathway toward a Paris Agreement-aligned pathway/LCCP) at 1,526 MtCO2e by 2050, and the more ambitious LCCP scenario at 540 MtCO2e by 2050.</sup></p>",

Implemented by C40 Cities, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Under2 Coalition (Climate Group), and funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Accelerator supports governments in designing, implementing and enforcing policies that reduce building emissions and increase resilience to climate change impacts.</p><p>The ZERB Accelerator has since become a recognized global initiative and an active member of <a href=\"https://globalabc.org/\">UNEP's Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction</a> (GlobalABC). Through its newly created Expert Advisory Group (EAG), it convenes over 40 organizations working across areas such as green finance, building codes, capacity strengthening and national-local coordination.</p><p>In its first year, the ZERB Accelerator piloted ambitious multilevel climate action with national and subnational partners in Colombia, Kenya and the Philippines. It helped advance mandatory building standards and national roadmaps while strengthening enforcement capacity across subnational governments, ultimately contributing to national and international climate mitigation goals. These achievements were presented by government partners from Colombia and Kenya at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/fMHn_ZR2JD8\">a panel event during COP30</a> to showcase how multilevel government partnerships can help unlock impact across the buildings and construction sector.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1067\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"854\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"654\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"515\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"308\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Panelists speaking at a climate-friendly buildings event at the UN climate summit.\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-12/cop30-zerb-accelerator-panel_0.jpg?VersionId=qzQMstF1xa7kZZzHZpDLEClCEQcgjQdw&itok=Xd2bepKq\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Panelists at the ZERB Accelerator panel event at COP30 shared experiences on how multilevel action can accelerate the transition to zero emission and resilient buildings in Colombia and Kenya.

It is working in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MESD); the Ministry of Housing, City and Territory (MHCT); and subnational governments of different sizes, including Bogotá, Santiago de Cali, Valledupar and Maicao.</p><p>In 2025, WRI led ZERB Accelerator activities with the Ministry of Housing and local EAG partners — including the Colombian Council of Sustainable Construction (CCCS) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation's CEELA project on building efficiency implemented by EBP Chile — co-hosting a series of webinars and working sessions for subnational governments. These sessions aimed to disseminate information about Resolution 0194 and co-design implementation guidelines, as well as enforcement and reporting mechanisms, suitable for nationwide adoption by municipalities of all sizes. The ZERB Accelerator and EAG partners then used insights from these sessions and international best practices to create recommendations for the enforcement of the Resolution and the design of the digital platform that will be used as its monitoring and control mechanism. The platform is meant to help maximize adoption by subnational governments as well as representatives from the construction sector.</p><p>Lastly, in coordination with the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High-Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP)</a> initiative, the project supported the update of Colombia's NDC 3.0 for the housing sector. The new NDC recognizes sustainable construction as a key measure to help reach the national target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 51% by 2030, relative to the emissions projected for that year under the reference scenario. Resolution 0194 is consolidated as one of the main instruments to operationalize this commitment.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1052\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"842\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"645\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"508\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"304\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People attending an event.\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-12/climate-resilient-housing-event_0.jpg?VersionId=2WQ9iOMyJA2VxCKMj_PC.O4QpgJRmY6a&itok=BuPsoZWc\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The event \"Weaving a Climate-Resilient Future for NDC 3.0 from the Housing, Water and Sanitation Sector,\" held on September 3, 2025, and organized by WRI, MESD and MHCT.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Kenya</h3><p>In Kenya, the ZERB Accelerator has partnered at the national level with the State Department of Public Works (which sits under the Ministry of Lands, Public Works & Urban Development) and at the subnational level with the Council of Governors and the pilot county of Kisumu. This collaboration, led by WRI with the instrumental support of the Kenya Green Building Society (KGBS), aims to ensure that local governments are included in developing and implementing two key national frameworks: the National Decarbonization Roadmap for Buildings and Construction (2026-2040), which is led by the Global Building Performance Network (GBPN); and the National Green Building Standards, which are coordinated by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Africa. The ZERB Accelerator also provided recommendations for the design, implementation and enforcement of these new standards.</p><p>On Oct. 27-28, 2025, the ZERB Accelerator hosted a two-day workshop in Naivasha, Kenya, bringing together governments, EAG partners and local actors to gather feedback on the Decarbonization Roadmap and discuss key elements for local implementation of the Green Building Standards. Additionally, through a series of working meetings, participants reviewed past and current experiences with green buildings and building regulations to identify gaps, challenges and opportunities for Kenya's new standards.</p><p>Insights and data from local government representatives, together with technical guidance from the World Bank and the American Society for Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), are now informing the design and implementation of the National Roadmap and National Green Building Standards, particularly in shaping how Kenya's county governments can take effective local action. </p><h3>The Philippines</h3><p>The Philippines is a relatively new addition to the ZERB accelerator; Quezon City and the national Department of Energy joined in the last quarter of 2025. Led by C40, the multilevel partnership and the EAG established a two-year workplan that will set out a process for revising national codes to improve the performance of new buildings. The new codes are meant to incorporate best practices in building energy efficiency and low carbon and resilient design. A range of local expert stakeholders will be included in the working groups.</p><h3>The Road Ahead</h3><p>The ZERB Accelerator and partners are entering a transition in 2026 as the initiative's first stage comes to a close. The Accelerator's work moving forward will align with the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">CHAMP initiative</a> to strengthen national commitments supported by local action. EAG members and partner governments will continue to guide and support individual country workplans.</p><p>In Colombia, CCCS and CEELA will continue supporting local capacity building and digitalization of the monitoring system. In Kenya, IFC Africa will continue developing the National Green Building Standards, while KGBS and GlobalABC engage in capacity building with Kisumu and other county governments to pilot local implementation. In the Philippines, C40 will continue to support ZERB Accelerator activities in 2026 to deliver the workplan agreed with the jurisdictions and EAG partners, contributing to national and international commitments.</p><p>The ZERB Accelerator stands as an example of the powerful impact that is possible through multilevel partnerships. Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, stakeholders will continue to seek new partnerships and resources that are essential for sustaining progress toward a resilient, zero-emission buildings sector.</p>",
