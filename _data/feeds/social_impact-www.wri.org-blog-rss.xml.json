      "description": "<p>Extreme weather events like floods and droughts are becoming more frequent and intense around the globe, disrupting communities and the infrastructure they rely on. In 2024 alone, the world endured <a href=\"https://www.ajg.com/gallagherre/-/media/files/gallagher/gallagherre/news-and-insights/2025/natural-catastrophe-and-climate-report-2025.pdf\">58 disasters</a> that wreaked over a billion dollars in damages each. Yet finance to cope with and respond to these impacts falls persistently short: The gap between funding needed to adapt to climate change and what is currently available is as high as <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024\">$359 billion per year</a>.</p><p>Part of the reason is that adaptation measures, such as strengthening early warning systems or making infrastructure more resilient, are seen only as a way to avoid potential losses — not as a broader investment opportunity. But this underestimates the true value of adaptation and the returns it can bring.</p><p>New <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\">WRI research</a> finds that investing $1 in adaptation can yield more than $10.50 in benefits over 10 years. This reflects not only the avoided losses from climate impacts, but also a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits that are generated even when disasters <em>don't </em>occur.</p><p>In other words, adaptation is not just a crucial response to the climate crisis; it is also one of the smartest investments of our time.</p><h3>The 'Triple Dividend' of Adaptation Investments</h3><p>In a new paper, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\"><em>Strengthening the Investment Case for Climate Adaptation</em></a>, WRI analyzed investments in 320 adaptation and resilience projects spanning agriculture, water, health and infrastructure. These ranged from upgrading food storage facilities in Bangladesh to improving water management in Brazil.</p><p>Cumulatively, the investments we analyzed cost over $133 billion and are expected to generate $1.4 trillion in benefits over 10 years. Individual investments were estimated to generate an impressive average return of 27%.</p><p>Moreover, many of the benefits expected from these investments were neither monetized nor included in the projected returns because they are difficult to model and quantify. Researchers found that only 8% of investment appraisals estimated the full monetized values of these dividends — suggesting that the $1.4 trillion and the average rate of return are likely substantial underestimates.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1156\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"925\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"708\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"558\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"334\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart showing the rate of return on climate adaptation investments by sector.\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/adaptation-returns-by-sector-wri_0.png?VersionId=j1_22FVj4O9WkzV3jEjs8J8ObBTqWvhm&itok=1rbfvADL\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>So, where do these returns come from? Our research used the \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/triple-dividend-building-climate-resilience-taking-stock-moving-forward\">triple dividend of resilience</a>\" framework to capture three key categories of returns on adaptation investments: avoided losses, induced economic development, and additional social and environmental benefits. We found that adaptation projects often have benefits evenly distributed across all three dividends — and generate higher rates of return than commonly assumed.</p><p>Consider an urban infrastructure project in Vietnam that aims to reduce flooding and improve water drainage. When estimating the return on this project, many models would consider only the avoided cost of flood damage. But investments in resilient infrastructure could also increase average land prices; decrease healthcare costs by reducing waterborne diseases; and boost workers' productivity by reducing travel time, thanks to new and improved roads. The triple dividend framework would account for all these outcomes, offering a more complete picture of the value that adaptation and resilience projects can bring.</p><h3>Good Adaptation Is Good Development</h3><p>Part of the challenge with funding adaptation is that it's often seen as an unaffordable, incremental cost that competes with other national development priorities. But the triple dividend framework reveals that the two often go hand in hand. In many of the investments we analyzed, adaptation efforts are key to unlocking resilient development.</p><h4>Health</h4><p>Adaptation investments in the health sector offer some of the highest returns of those we analyzed, averaging over 78%. This is because investing in more resilient health systems can save lives, improve public health and bolster economic productivity, especially among vulnerable populations.</p><p>For example, the Social and Economic Inclusion Project in Kenya targeted drought-prone regions, where climate shocks deepen poverty and vulnerability. Children are particularly affected: Droughts lead to increased levels of malnutrition and stunted growth, blocking them from reaching their full development potential.</p><p>Kenya's project aimed to address these issues by offering cash transfers and nutritional counseling during droughts, or by deploying community health workers to remote areas affected by climate hazards. It also looked to expand access to healthcare services more broadly, which in turn would boost productivity and learning outcomes among poor and vulnerable households. This is expected to bring significant development gains on top of avoided losses, making the project a model for health-centered adaptation.</p><h4>Disaster risk management</h4><p>Investments in disaster risk management also deliver high returns — nearly 36% on average — by safeguarding lives and infrastructure while minimizing economic disruption. This is particularly true of <a href=\"https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/uploads/GlobalCommission_Report_FINAL.pdf?_gl=1*f6ke33*_gcl_au*NTc4MzYyODM3LjE3NDE3MTU4ODQ.\">cost-effective tools</a> like early warning systems.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A farmer harvests rice from a flooded field.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/bangladesh-farmer-flooded-rice-field_0.jpg?VersionId=gMk2Vvg0dDc_9Q_Pi6Aw2AOzH1WrnBsK&itok=4Ar8XDUr\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A farmer in Sunamganj, Bangladesh harvests rice paddy from a flooded field after torrential rains in 2022.

It also set up an online information portal as well as physical kiosks and display boards to provide farmers with easier access to weather and water-related information. This is expected to help farmers better manage climate risks and protect their livelihoods — not only avoiding weather-related losses but also boosting their incomes in the long-term.</p><h4>Sustainable agriculture and forestry</h4><p>Adaptation returns in the agriculture and forestry sector average over 29%, largely driven by developmental gains like higher yields and productivity, as well as environmental benefits.</p><p>Ethiopia's Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project restored degraded landscapes in selected watersheds through measures such as hillside terraces and tree planting. At the same time, it trained communities in sustainable farming and grazing practices. Together, these measures could improve soil health, reduce erosion and enhance watersheds, making the area more resilient to floods and droughts while also improving crop and livestock production.</p><h4>Resilient infrastructure</h4><p>Projects focused on resilient energy, cities and transport systems offer wide-ranging benefits, with an average return on investment of close to 30%.</p><p>For example, the Sustainable Urban Development Project in Fortaleza, Brazil, restored natural wetlands in <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/02/27/brasil-preparar-cidades-mudancas-climaticas-solucoes-natureza\">Rachel de Quieroz Park</a> to help soak up and hold stormwater. This buffers surrounding neighborhoods from floods while enhancing biodiversity. It also created new public spaces and revitalized existing green areas, which can attract more visitors and businesses, raise property values, and improve water quality and living conditions. Crucially, the project emphasized social benefits for women, who make up most of Fortaleza's population and are overrepresented in its low-income neighborhoods.</p><h4>Water</h4><p>Managing water is fundamental to climate resilience. Worsening storms and floods inundate entire cities; crippling droughts parch farmland; and intensifying climate risks threaten water supplies. In our study, water-related projects saw 19% returns on average — although this does not fully capture the range of benefits from investing in the water sector, which are often difficult to measure and quantify.</p><p>The Transformative Riverine Management Project in Durban, South Africa, is leveraging nature-based solutions, such as creating and rehabilitating wetlands, to address water risks. This generates benefits across all three dividends: It reduces flood-related losses by improving water absorption. It yields economic benefits, such as creating new jobs and increasing food production and bioenergy generation. It also brings social and environmental benefits, like reducing erosion, improving local water quality, sequestering planet-warming carbon and creating spaces to enjoy the outdoors. The estimated benefits from this project are valued at nearly six times the project cost.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Commuters stuck at a flooded river with a damaged bridge.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-05/durban-flood_0.jpg?VersionId=fd4_TSkSXs88Yqc8hksDyTZ6ztEtX5_I&h=2e111cc1&itok=skLRYhet\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>People cross a flooded river in Durban, South Africa in 2022.

In fact, over 65% of the monetized benefits in our study were unrelated to expected climate shocks — from job creation and productivity gains to healthier communities and environments.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1127\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"901\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"690\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"544\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"325\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart showing how returns on adaptation investments are distributed across avoided losses and environmental, social and economic benefits. \" height=\"325\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/adaptation-triple-dividend-wri_0.png?VersionId=bwueEKtju.JkI_JFPhpKK6AQIgbGPMdA&itok=2l41Ifta\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In many cases, these broader development gains matched or exceeded the value of avoided losses.</p><p>For example, China's Hubei Yichang Rural Green Development Project seeks to modernize the agricultural sector in Yichang Municipality by investing in modern agricultural practices and technology; installing treatment systems for agricultural waste and water; and improving climate-resilient rural infrastructure, such as building more efficient irrigation systems and better drainage. The projected productivity and resilience gains from these efforts surpass the amount that could be saved through avoided flood losses.</p><h3>Adaptation Investments Also Curb Emissions</h3><p>While our study largely focused on the triple dividend of adaptation investments, the benefits don't stop there.</p><p>Climate mitigation — efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and curb temperature rise — has historically been siloed from adaptation in international climate negotiations and policy planning. The two are often viewed as competing priorities, vying for limited climate finance.</p><p>However, nearly half of the adaptation investments we analyzed helped to lower GHG emissions, revealing untapped opportunities to align strategies and unlock more finance. This shows that investing in adaptation can be a powerful tool to help curb temperature rise while also building resilience against future risks.</p><p>The Heritage Colombia Project, for example, is working to restore forest ecosystems in degraded areas and improve land and forest management: two strategies that can increase natural carbon removal. The value of these GHG emissions reductions is estimated at $1.45 billion — topping the estimated value of avoided losses ($1.2 billion) and significantly larger than the $31 million estimated in other social and environmental benefits.</p><h3>Unlocking Adaptation's Full Value</h3><p>Looking at the full picture puts adaptation in a new light. Our research challenges the mindset that adaptation is a financial burden, pulling limited funds from other priorities. It proves that it is often much more profitable to adapt than not to do so — and that good adaptation is, in fact, good development.</p><p>But despite a compelling investment case, the adaptation finance gap remains.</p><p>More work is needed to build on these learnings and further demystify adaptation's contribution to development goals. Improving the data collection, monitoring and evaluation systems for adaptation investments — both before and after implementation —<span> </span>can deepen our understanding of their diverse benefits. More evidence on the realized impacts of adaptation investments, coupled with improved cost-benefit methodologies, could help refine our understanding of their benefits across all three dividends and attract additional finance from more diverse sources.</p><p>The adaptation finance gap isn't just a shortfall — it's a missed opportunity. Every year of delay leaves communities exposed to escalating climate risks and foregoes significant economic, social and environmental benefits from resilient development. It's time for governments and development partners to make one of the smartest investments for both people and the planet.</p>",

      "description": "<p>2025 is a pivotal moment for climate action. Countries are submitting new climate commitments, otherwise known as \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">Nationally Determined Contributions</a>\" or \"NDCs,\" that will shape the trajectory of global climate progress through 2035.</p><p>These new commitments will show how boldly countries plan to cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, transform their economies, and strengthen resilience to growing threats like extreme weather, wildfires and floods. Collectively, they will determine how far the world goes toward limiting global temperature rise and avoiding the worst climate impacts.</p><p>A few countries, such as the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, have already put forward new climate plans — and their ambition is a mixed bag. But it's still early: Many more countries, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to reveal their NDCs and are expected to do so in the coming months.</p><p>We analyzed the initial submissions for a snapshot of how countries' climate plans are shaping up so far and what they reveal about the road ahead.</p><h3>Where the World Stands on Curbing Climate Change Today</h3><p>A decade ago, the world was headed toward <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf\">3.7-4.8 degrees C</a> (6.7-8.6 degrees F) of warming by 2100, threatening catastrophic weather, devastating biodiversity loss and widespread economic disruptions. In response, the Paris Agreement set a global goal: limit temperature rise to well below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and strive to limit it to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), thresholds scientists say can significantly lessen climate hazards. Though some impacts are inevitable — with extreme heat, storms, fires and floods already worsening — lower levels of warming dramatically reduce their severity. Every fraction of a degree matters.</p><p>To keep the Paris Agreement's temperature goals within reach, countries agreed to submit new NDCs every five years. These national plans detail how (and how much) each country will cut emissions, how they'll adapt to climate impacts like droughts and rising seas, and what support they'll need to deliver on those efforts. </p><p>Countries have gone through two rounds of NDCs so far, in 2015 and 2020-2021, with their commitments extending through 2030. </p><p>While the latest NDCs cut emissions more deeply than those from 2015, they still fall short of the ambition needed to hold warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees C. If fully implemented (including measures that require international support), they could bring down projected warming to <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/nations-must-close-huge-emissions-gap-new-climate-pledges-and\">2.6-2.8 degrees C</a> (4.7-5 degrees F). And without stronger policies to meet countries' targets, the world could be heading for a far more dangerous <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/nations-must-close-huge-emissions-gap-new-climate-pledges-and\">3.1 degrees C</a> (5.6 degrees F) of warming by 2100.</p><p>Now the third round is underway, with countries expected to set climate targets through 2035.</p><p>These new NDCs are expected to reflect the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop28-outcomes-next-steps\">outcomes</a> of the 2023 Global Stocktake, which was the first comprehensive assessment of global climate progress under the Paris Agreement. In addition to bigger emissions cuts in line with holding warming to 1.5 degrees C, the Stocktake called on countries to act swiftly in areas that matter most for addressing the climate crisis — especially fossil fuels, renewables, transport and forests — and to do more to build resilience to climate impacts.</p><p>2025 NDCs are also an <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/aligning-ndcs-15degc-net-zero-and-lt-leds\">opportunity to align</a> near-term climate action with longer-term goals. Over <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker\">100 countries</a> have already pledged to reach <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/net-zero-ghg-emissions-questions-answered\">net-zero emissions</a>, most by around mid-century. Their new NDCs should chart a course toward achieving this.</p><h3>How Many Countries Have Submitted New NDCs? </h3><p>Under the Paris Agreement's timeline, 2025 NDCs were technically due in February. As of late May, only a <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">small proportion</a> of countries had submitted them, covering around a quarter of global emissions.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23444755/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These early movers include a diverse mix of developed and developing nations from different regions and economic backgrounds.</p><p>Among the G20 — the world's largest GHG emitters — only five countries submitted new NDCs so far: <strong>Canada</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong>, the<strong> United States</strong> and the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. (Since submitting its NDC, the U.S. announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.)</p><p>Several smaller and highly climate-vulnerable countries have also stepped forward, including <strong>Ecuador</strong> and <strong>Uruguay</strong> in Latin America;<strong> Kenya</strong>, <strong>Zambia</strong> and <strong>Zimbabwe </strong>in Africa; and island states such as <strong>Singapore</strong>, the <strong>Marshall Islands</strong> and the <strong>Maldives</strong>.</p><p>That means close to <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">90% of countries</a> have yet to submit their new NDCs.</p><p>There are several reasons for this. The last round of NDCs was pushed back by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, giving countries only four years to prepare new plans. Geopolitical tensions, ongoing conflicts and security concerns have further complicated progress. Many smaller developing nations are also facing capacity constraints as they work to complete biennial climate progress reports and new national adaptation plans (NAPs), also due this year.</p><p>Most countries <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/ten-years-since-the-paris-agreement-how-far-we-have-come-the-journey-ahead-un-climate-chief-delivers\">are now expected</a> to present their new NDCs by the UN General Assembly in September.</p><h3>How Much Have New NDCs Reduced the Emissions Gap?</h3><p>Compared to previous targets, the NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 \"emissions gap\": the difference between where emissions need to be in 2035 to align with 1.5 degrees C and where they're expected to be under countries' new climate plans.</p><p>If fully implemented, new unconditional NDCs (those that don't require international support) are projected to reduce emissions by 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 when compared to 2030. Including conditional targets (those dependent on receiving international support), countries could reduce emissions by 1.5 GtCO2e compared to previous NDCs.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3138478/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Much of the progress in narrowing the gap comes from major emitters that have already submitted new NDCs — most notably the U.S., Japan and Brazil. Given their large emissions profiles, their new commitments account for the majority of the reductions seen so far.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Explore the NDC Tracker</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Use the <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">NDC tracker</a> on Climate Watch to monitor new NDC submissions as they come in and see how much they could reduce emissions if fully achieved.</p></div><p><strong>While this marks progress, it's far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits.</strong> Getting on track to 1.5 or even 2 degrees C would require much steeper cuts than what's currently on the table.</p><p>However, this is not the full picture.</p><p>Many of the world's largest emitters have yet to submit their 2035 targets. The remaining G20 countries alone account for about two-thirds of global GHG emissions. This makes their forthcoming NDCs especially important: The scale and ambition of these commitments could meaningfully narrow the emissions gap — or, if they fall short, leave the world locked into a trajectory that puts global temperature targets out of reach.</p><h4>Emissions-reduction targets put forward by major emitters so far:</h4><table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th>Country​</th><th>Reference Year​</th><th>Previous 2030 Emissions-Reduction Target​</th><th>New 2035 Emissions-Reduction Targets​</th><th>Net-Zero Target Year​</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Brazil​</td><td>2005​</td><td>53.1%​</td><td>59%-67%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>Canada​</td><td>2005​</td><td>40%-45%​</td><td>45%-50%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>Japan​</td><td>2013​</td><td>46%​</td><td>60%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom​</td><td>1990​</td><td>68%​</td><td>81%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2005​</td><td>50%-52%​</td><td>61%-66%​</td><td>2050​</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>How Do Specific Countries' Climate Plans Stack Up?</h3><p>Among the countries that have submitted new NDCs so far, the <strong>United Kingdom </strong>stands out for its ambitious climate trajectory. Following the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/2024/10/26/ccc-advises-81-reduction-in-emissions-by-2035/\">recommendations</a> of its Climate Change Committee, the U.K. has set a bold target to reduce emissions 81% by 2035 from 1990 levels. This rapid decline in the coming decade would put the country on track toward its net zero goal by 2050, <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-advice-on-the-uks-2035-nationally-determined-contribution-ndc/\">based on</a> realistic rates of technology deployment and ambitious but achievable shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p><p>Other countries, such as <strong>Japan</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong>, have opted for a \"linear\" approach toward net zero — meaning if they drew a straight line to their net-zero target (for example, 0 GtCO2e in 2050), their 2030 and 2035 targets would fall along it, reflecting a constant decline in emissions each year. Japan aims to cut emissions 60% from 2013 levels by 2035, while the United States has pledged a 61%-66% reduction from 2005 levels by 2035.</p><p>Despite the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, undermining climate policies and attempting to dismantle key government institutions, its NDC target may still provide a framework for climate action at the state, city and local levels, as well as for future administrations. Many of these entities have <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/press-releases/alliance-2035-target-dec-2024/?ref=csofutures.com\">already</a> rallied around the new NDC and are committed to making progress toward its targets.</p><p>However, the linear approach Japan and the U.S. are taking to emissions reductions — as opposed to a steeper decline this decade — risks using up a larger share of the world's carbon budget earlier and compromising global temperature targets.</p><p><strong>Brazil </strong>presented a broader range of emissions targets in its NDC, committing to a 59%-67% reduction by 2035 from 2005 levels. These two poles represent a marked difference in ambition: A 67% reduction could put Brazil on track for climate neutrality by 2050, while a 59% reduction falls short of what's needed to meet that goal. It is unclear which trajectory the government intends to pursue, leaving Brazil's true ambition in question. The NDC also omits carbon budgets for specific sectors (such as energy, transport or agriculture), which would clarify how it plans to meet its overarching emissions goals. However, Brazil committed <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2024-11/Brazil_Second%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20%28NDC%29_November2024.pdf\">within its NDC</a> to develop further plans outlining how each sector will contribute to its 2035 target.</p><p>Elsewhere, <strong>Canada</strong> made only a marginal increase to its target, shifting from a 40%-45% emissions reduction by 2030 to 45%-50% by 2035 from 2005 levels. This falls short of the <a href=\"https://www.nzab2050.ca/news-insights/net-zero-advisory-body-responds-to-todays-announcement-of-canadas-greenhouse-gas-emissions-target-for-2035\">recommendation</a> from Canada's own Net-Zero Advisory Body, which called for a 50%-55% reduction by 2035 — and warned that anything below 50% risks derailing progress toward the country's legislated net-zero goal by 2050. While every increase in ambition counts, such incremental changes do not match the urgent pace of progress needed among developed and wealthy economies like Canada.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23486838/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">Related</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">What Would Ambitious Climate Commitments Look Like for the World's Top Emitters?</a></li></ul></div><h3>What Trends Are Emerging Among NDCs Submitted So Far?</h3><p>Several early trends are starting to emerge among the new NDCs. While these initial submissions offer valuable insights, they don't yet reflect the full picture; deeper analysis will be needed as more NDCs come in throughout the year.</p><h4>1) Nearly all new NDCs include 2035 mitigation measures, with many setting economy-wide emissions-reduction targets.</h4><p>Almost all of the 22 NDCs submitted thus far include 2035 mitigation measures. The exception is <strong>Zambia</strong>, which reiterated its previous 2030 pledges in a provisional NDC (although this may still be revised to include 2035 mitigation measures).</p><p>Of the other 21 submissions, 20 countries expressed their 2035 targets as emissions-reduction goals. The exception was <strong>Cuba</strong>, which instead committed to increasing renewable electricity generation to 26% and improving energy efficiency by 2035.</p><p>Seventeen of the 20 countries with emissions-reduction goals set economy-wide reduction targets for 2035, as encouraged by the Global Stocktake, covering all sectors and greenhouse gases. The remaining few — smaller developing countries such as the <strong>Maldives</strong> and <strong>Nepal </strong>— submitted targets that cover only specific sectors or gases.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries are required to submit economy-wide targets, while developing countries are encouraged to work toward them over time. In Nepal's case, for instance, a lack of comprehensive data limited its ability to define an economy-wide target or fully assess the impact of its policies.</p><h4>2) Most countries did not strengthen their 2030 targets.</h4><p>Despite clear scientific evidence and UN decisions urging stronger 2030 targets, only four countries — <strong>Saint Lucia</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Moldova </strong>and <strong>Montenegro</strong> — have strengthened their 2030 emissions pledges. For example, Montenegro revised its emissions-reduction target from 35% to 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and set a 60% emissions-reduction target by 2035. </p><p>Notably, none of the wealthier, high-emitting and more developed countries have strengthened their 2030 targets — despite having the greatest capacity and responsibility to take the lead on slashing emissions.</p><h4>3) Countries are increasingly prioritizing adaptation.</h4><p>In the face of worsening climate impacts, 16 of the 22 countries that have submitted new NDCs strengthened their adaptation commitments — continuing a trend seen in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/state-nationally-determined-contributions-2022\">previous rounds</a>. Countries are prioritizing adaptation across sectors such as food and water systems, public health and nature-based solutions.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Firefighters putting out flames along a highway.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/canaad-fire-fighters_0.jpg?VersionId=oDsXmUNOUA7kTI8Zc.sWJ1cA5GyZ_rB1&itok=KlqXVuzm\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Canadian firefighters in 2021.

Some developed countries are also prioritizing adaptation action in their NDCs. <strong>Canada</strong>, which has witnessed devastating wildfires in recent years, cited its National Adaptation Strategy, which provides a framework for disaster resilience, biodiversity, public health and infrastructure.</p><h4>4) Countries are recognizing the importance of subnational action.</h4><p>Some countries' NDCs also recognize the critical role that subnational actors — such as cities, states and regions — play in shaping and delivering climate action.</p><p>Eleven of the newly submitted NDCs come from countries that have endorsed the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP)</a>. The CHAMP initiative — launched in 2023 by the COP28 Presidency, in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies and with the support of WRI and other partners — aims to strengthen collaboration between national and subnational governments on climate planning and implementation. As part of this commitment, 75 countries pledged to consult with and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/stronger-ndcs-cities-states-regions-recommendations-national-governments\">integrate</a> subnational priorities and needs into their NDCs. Of the 11 endorsing countries that have submitted new NDCs, four explicitly mentioned CHAMP.</p><p><strong>Brazil's </strong>NDC in particular recognizes the critical role subnational governments play in delivering national climate goals. Referred to as \"climate federalism,\" it highlights an instrument designed to support the integration of climate action into planning and decision-making across all levels of government: federal, state and municipal.</p><h3>How Are Countries Addressing Key Areas like Energy, Forestry and Transport?</h3><p>As countries submit new NDCs for the first time since the Global Stocktake in 2023, a clearer picture is emerging of how governments are embedding sector-specific action into their new climate plans. From detailed emissions-reduction targets to broader policy frameworks, most NDCs are setting out concrete steps to cut emissions across sectors that largely drive climate change, such as energy, transport and forestry.</p><p>Some countries — such as <strong>Switzerland</strong>, the <strong>UAE</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong> and <strong>Zimbabwe</strong> — have included sector-specific emissions-reduction targets directly in their NDCs. Switzerland's targets, for instance are aligned with its Climate and Innovation Act, with plans to cut emissions by 66% in buildings, 41% in transport and 42.5% in industry by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. Kenya, on the other hand, has set an ambitious target to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation in the national grid by 2035.</p><p>Others, like the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Singapore</strong>, the <strong>Marshall Islands </strong>and <strong>Canada</strong>, have focused on elaborating national policies and strategies that respond to the Global Stocktake's priority areas. The U.K.'s NDC highlighted its Clean Power 2030 Action Plan to fully decarbonize electricity by 2030; the Warm Homes Plan to boost energy efficiency in residential buildings; and reaffirmed its plans for phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1189\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"951\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"728\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"574\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"343\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cyclists on a closed-off city street to allow for biking and walking.\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/brazil-sao-paulo-cyclists.jpg?VersionId=foGuCuISvtbdA3gTGD_qkoedW3FFd7M5&itok=F-sOdcK-\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, Brazil, is car-free on Sundays to allow for more pedestrians and cyclists. Brazil has promised to submit new sectoral plans laying out what it will do in specific areas, like transport, to meet its broader climate goals. Photo by William Rodrigues dos Santos/Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Countries such as <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>New Zealand</strong> have committed to developing detailed sectoral strategies as a next step to support NDC implementation. Brazil plans to update its national climate strategy by mid-2025, breaking it down into 16 sectoral adaptation plans and seven mitigation plans. New Zealand committed to publishing its emissions-reduction plan for 2031-2035 in 2029, which will set out sectoral mitigation strategies to help deliver on its NDC.</p><p>As more countries prepare to submit their new NDCs, attention will focus on whether they follow the trend of outlining sector-specific actions to meet their broader emissions targets. In particular, the spotlight will be on how countries plan to contribute to the transition away from fossil fuels — the single largest driver of the climate crisis.</p><div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">Related</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/ndcs/sectoral-opportunities\">Learn More About How Countries Can Incorporate Sectoral Targets into NDCs</a></li></ul></div><h3>Looking Ahead, All Eyes Are on 3 Major Emitters</h3><p>We have yet to see new NDCs from many major emitters, including the European Union, China and India. All three have demonstrated climate leadership in various ways, and their actions will set the tone for future climate efforts. While these three are in the spotlight, attention will also be on other key countries — such as Indonesia, Mexico and Australia -— that are critical to reducing the global emissions gap.</p><h4>European Union</h4><p>The EU is still working to set a 2035 emissions target for <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters#:~:text=limit%20within%20reach.-,European%20Union,-Submitted%20in%202023\">its new NDC</a>, which will hinge on its longer-term 2040 target. Last year, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_588\">recommended</a> cutting emissions 90% by 2040 — a move that's seen as <a href=\"https://strategicperspectives.eu/eu-2040-climate-target-a-strong-economic-and-security-case-for-the-net-zero-transition/\">beneficial</a> for enhancing industrial competitiveness in clean technologies, strengthening energy security and cutting energy costs. Some EU member states have <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-all-but-guaranteed-to-miss-global-deadline-for-climate-targets/\">suggested</a> following a linear trajectory between the 2030 and 2040 targets, which would imply a 72.5% reduction by 2035 if the 90% target for 2040 gets adopted.</p><p>However, European member states have yet to adopt the 90% target. Ongoing discussions could see the EU's target <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-exploring-weaker-2040-climate-goal-90-greenhouse-gas-cut-wopke-hoekstra/\">weakened</a> to address concerns from heavy industry and agriculture. The delay in finalizing the EU's 2040 target is also putting its NDC timeline at risk, raising the possibility of missing the expected September submission date.</p><h4>China</h4><p>As the world's largest emitter, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters#:~:text=help%20guide%20implementation.-,China,-China%20overtook%20the\">China's NDC</a> will be critical to keeping global temperature goals within reach. The country has already made major strides in clean energy, leading the world in solar power and electric vehicle deployment. However, a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/lessons-for-coal-plant-cancellation#:~:text=3%20Countries%20to%20Watch%20for%20Coal%20Development\">surge in coal plant approvals</a> post-pandemic has raised concerns about its path toward net zero by 2060.</p><p>China's 2035 emission target will be the first in a post-peak emissions context. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">Studies</a> aligned with 1.5 degrees C and China's net-zero pledge suggest the need for sharper cuts by 2030 and continued deep reductions through 2035. In this context, <a href=\"https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/charting-chinas-path-its-2035-nationally-determined-contribution\">some</a> <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/chinas-clean-energy-trends-could-cut-emissions-by-30-in-2035-if-sustained/\">research</a> suggests that China could reduce CO2 emissions 30% by 2035 (compared to 2020) on the way to achieve its net zero target by 2060.</p><p>President Xi Jinping <a href=\"https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202504/content_7020623.htm\">announced</a> in April that China will submit its updated NDC ahead of the UN climate summit (COP30) this November, covering <em>all</em> sectors and greenhouse gases. This marks a notable shift for the country: Its previous NDCs covered only CO2, but China's non-CO2 emissions alone place it among the world's top 10 emitters.</p><h4>India</h4><p>Unlike other major economies, India has some of the lowest <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/charts-explain-per-capita-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">per capita emissions</a>, and its national emissions are still growing as the country works to eradicate poverty and achieve development goals. This means its emissions are not expected to decline by 2035, though some <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">studies</a> suggest earlier declines are needed. Rapid advances in renewable energy and clean technology offer a significant opportunity for the country to accelerate its low-carbon transition while also ensuring energy security and economic competitiveness.</p><p>Strengthening renewable energy commitments in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters#:~:text=degrees%20C%20future.-,India,-India%E2%80%99s%20GHG%20emissions\">India's next NDC</a> — building upon its domestic target of 500 GW by 2030 — could chart a pathway for sustainable growth, while also delivering co-benefits like cleaner air and enhanced energy security.</p><h3>What's Next for NDCs?</h3><p>The UN climate change body (UNFCCC) will release an NDC synthesis report ahead of this year's COP30 climate summit, assessing the collective impact of the new pledges submitted to that point. While this report will solidify where we're headed in relation to the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, the storyline is already clear:<strong> New NDCs will not put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C.</strong></p><p>The emissions gap is likely to remain dangerously wide, and the report will reaffirm what we already know — that much greater ambition and action are needed. Still, the findings will serve as a key input for this year's climate conference, where countries will decide on next steps to narrow that gap. They must address what comes after NDCs, grappling with how to turn ambition into action and keep a safer future within reach.</p><p>Ultimately, putting forward strong plans — and fulfilling them — are essential levers: not only for limiting warming, but for safeguarding the health, prosperity and security of current and future generations.</p>",

      "description": "<p>As the climate crisis intensifies, transitioning to sustainable energy has emerged as a pivotal focus of global efforts. Outdated and fragile energy systems impede countries and regions from increasing energy access and affordability, improving air pollution and living standards, and driving industrialization and modernization.</p><p>Since the international Paris Agreement on climate change was signed in 2015, global renewable energy investments have nearly tripled. However, these investments are predominantly concentrated in developed countries, leaving developing countries with a need of approximately $1.7 trillion annually in renewable energy investments. In 2022, foreign direct investment to developing countries only <a href=\"https://unctad.org/publication/world-investment-report-2023\">covered 32%</a> of this need.</p><p>At the heart of the global climate agenda is Africa, a continent of immense potential with abundant renewable energy resources, a growing youth population and vast natural capital. However, it is also one of the most vulnerable regions to the negative impacts of climate change. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly <a href=\"https://www.afd.fr/en/electrification-clean-energy-sub-saharan-africa\">80% of the world’s population without access to electricity</a>, yet in 2022, the continent received only 1% of global renewable energy. Addressing Africa's energy challenges and accelerating its transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy are crucial for global climate action.</p><p>As Africa’s key trading and investment partners, China and the European Union can play an important role in supporting the continent’s energy transition. Since the early 21st century, both China and the EU have built upon their existing ties with Africa to establish and strengthen new forms of cooperation with energy as a critical area of focus.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1024\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"819\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"627\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"494\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A woman holding a hoe watches a man operate a solar water pump in Malawi, Africa.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/solar-water-pump-milawi-africa_1.jpg?VersionId=1vLzi57XM3LuZSCIkpHOi7Kt6Ky5xFD9&itok=xUVzwdjs\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Africa is embracing the energy transition and taking advantage of its abundant natural resources, such as sunlight, to install solar panels that power water pumps used for irrigation in Malawi.

For the past 15 years, China has already been Africa's <a href=\"https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/wsdwhfz/202409/t20240909_1392908.html\">largest trading partner</a> and remains the largest developing country investor in the region. At the 2024 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), both sides <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/wjbz/jh/202410/t20241021_11510754.html\">elevated and strengthened their partnership</a>. Under collaborative frameworks like FOCAC, the China-Africa Union Energy Partnership and the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, numerous projects have incorporated renewable energy objectives. The ongoing <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/africa-solar-belt-implementation-focac-2024\">Africa Solar Belt program</a>, for example, underscores this commitment, with China pledging at least 100 million yuan (about $14 million) in public funds from 2024 to 2027 to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/africa-solar-belt-implementation-focac-2024\">power 50,000 households</a> in Africa with off-grid solar systems.</p><p> The EU, through the Africa-EU Partnership and agreements with the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), is working to shift from a traditional “donor-recipient” relationship with Africa toward <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/africa-and-eu_en\">a more equal partnership</a>. In its latest Africa strategy and external energy policy, the EU prioritizes green transition and energy access as core objectives. Under its Global Gateway Initiative, the EU launched the Africa-EU Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), aiming for at least 50 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in Africa by 2030 as part of a 150 billion euro (about $170 million) investment plan, helping address energy access challenges for at least 100 million people. Additionally, many European countries have established bilateral partnerships with countries in Africa.</p><p>These commitments reflect a growing recognition of Africa’s crucial role in the global energy transition. However, meeting this moment requires confronting the scale and complexity of Africa’s own energy realities.</p><p>As Africa’s population grows and industrialization accelerates, electricity demand is projected to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X22000876\">increase tenfold between 2015 and 2065</a>. This surge presents profound challenges for the continent's energy transition, including persistent energy access disparities, limited economic viability of power development, inadequate power grid infrastructure and substantial investment shortfalls.</p><p>China, a global leader in renewable energy supply chains, brings extensive experience in project development, technology innovation and strong financial resources. Europe, on the other hand, excels in renewable energy finance and sustainable development standards and benefits from geographic proximity to Africa. Africa, beyond being a large and fast-growing market, offers unmatched opportunities for market expansion, abundant renewable energy resources essential for the global energy transition, a dynamic and youthful workforce, and the potential for green industrialization and innovation.  </p><p>Together, China, Europe and Africa can forge a powerful trilateral cooperation in renewable energy that can unlock synergies, drive inclusive and sustainable development, and contribute meaningfully to global climate goals while advancing Africa’s own energy realities.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Solar panels covering the roof of a small home in the midst of a lush green forest.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2024-08/home-solar-panels-sao-tome-e-principe.jpg?VersionId=Gg6FZdVAQ4FhXjxlyBVWLMBk_.TTLZ8y&itok=-bnf60vH\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Solar panels cover the roof of a home in São Tomé and Príncipe, one of the African countries that has initiated solar power development plans with support from China under the Africa Solar Belt Program. Photo by Wirestock/iStock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Unlocking Impact through Technical Cooperation and Scalable Pilots</h3><p>To move from ambition to impact, deepening technical cooperation and co-developing pilot projects that are scalable, replicable and locally grounded can serve as proof points for what trilateral cooperation can achieve.</p><p>Here are four project areas where this trilateral cooperation can make a difference in Africa’s energy transition:</p><h5>1) Leveraging micro-grid and off-grid renewable energy technologies to address electricity access</h5><p>For Africa, the majority of its population without electricity access lives in vast and sparsely populated rural areas, where traditional large power grids are usually impractical. Microgrid and off-grid renewable energy technologies, designed to adapt to local conditions and resources, are cost-effective and easy to maintain, making them well-suited to address Africa’s electricity supply challenges. European and Chinese technologies, resources and know-how can play a vital role in addressing electricity access for the hard-to-reach populations.</p><h5>2) Integrating renewable energy with other sectors to boost benefits</h5><p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge market for the application of distributed renewable energy in agricultural, mining, industrial and commercial sectors. Integrating renewable energy in these sectors, a concept known as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/productive-use-renewable-energy-africa\">Productive Use of Renewable Energy (PURE)</a>, can significantly boost the demand for renewable energy. To unlock this potential, China, the EU and Africa have the opportunity to collaborate in developing small and smart business models that prioritize cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Coupled with innovative financing solutions, this approach can help lower electricity costs, promote local industrialization and create jobs — delivering economic, environmental and social benefits in an integrated way.</p><h5>3) Renewable energy production to create new economic opportunities</h5><p>Africa’s abundant renewable resources and land offer distinct advantages in harnessing renewable energy, presenting new opportunities for Africa to boost its growth through low energy prices and even by assessing opportunities of its proximity to Europe, a key green hydrogen demand center. Through a trilateral collaboration, Europe can leverage on its market demands to facilitate an African export-oriented industry, for example in green energy, which would then boost the trade balances between these regions. Equally, China can leverage on its manufacturing and technological capacities to enable and facilitate this trilateral collaboration.  </p><h5>4) Upgrading and expanding power grids to enhance energy security</h5><p>The planning, investment and construction of cross-border power grids are critical for Africa to achieve energy security. The African Union (AU) launched the <a href=\"https://au.int/en/afsem#:~:text=AfSEM%20is%20designed%20to%20bring,response%20for%20strong%20growth%20of\">Africa Single Electricity Market (AfSEM)</a> to integrate Africa's five regional power pools into a unified electricity market. This initiative, supported by the African Continental Power Systems Masterplan, aims to boost energy security, optimize resource utilization, reduce energy costs and improve electricity access for all 55 AU member states, serving over 1.3 billion people. </p><p>The flagship AU Agenda 2063 initiative also provides a strategic solution for balancing electricity supply and demand. By improving cross-border power transmission and storage, electricity surplus and shortage across countries and regions can be balanced more effectively. However, this field requires overcoming high technical barriers and substantial funding needs, necessitating international support. The complexity and capital intensity of regional grid infrastructure present a clear opportunity for trilateral cooperation.</p><p>China, EU and African institutions can pool their complementary strengths — China’s experience in large-scale infrastructure development, the EU’s expertise in regulatory harmonization and smart grid technologies, and Africa’s political momentum and regional frameworks — to co-develop grid expansion projects. </p><p>Additionally, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence also have the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of large, interconnected power grids. Joint investment, technical assistance and capacity building can help overcome the technical and financial barriers, while accelerating the realization of AfSEM’s goals.</p><h3>Financial Support and International Exchange Are Indispensable</h3><p>Turning these collaborative visions into tangible outcomes hinges on two critical enablers:</p><h5>1) Mobilizing private capital to bridge funding gaps is crucial for cooperation among China, Europe and Africa</h5><p>Exploring the financial mechanisms that would enable deeper uptake of renewable energy and the associated de-risking mechanisms or tools that would be required is vital. Policy-based financial institutions or public funds can mitigate financing and investment risks in renewable energy projects by offering strategic products like guarantees and insurance, thereby attracting more private capital. Moreover, promoting coordination of cross-border and regional investment criteria among financial institutions will help streamline renewable energy financing channels, facilitating efficient capital and project matching. Under a trilateral cooperation, Europe’s deep financial markets can offer the necessary seed capital and de-risking instruments while China provides supply chain finance that would enable it to leverage its manufacturing prowess. In parallel, Africa could focus on deepening its local capital markets potentially by integrating its capital markets and by bolstering the available home-grown financial capital to the renewable energy sector.</p><h5>2) Strengthening the alignment of global initiatives </h5><p>Efforts can focus on enhancing benchmarking, mutual recognition and standardization in areas such as green supply chain management, product carbon footprint certification, and ESG management throughout the clean technology supply chain, including the mining and processing of upstream minerals. Establishing joint standards can reduce friction and barriers in trade and investment cooperation among China, Europe and Africa, supporting Africa’s balanced approach to energy transition and sustainable development.</p><p>As is the case with bilateral collaborations, a successful trilateral collaboration between China, Europe and Africa would need to provide mutual benefits for all players particularly as the shifting global winds of country-first engagements loom.</p><p><em>WRI Europe’s </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/stientje-van-veldhoven\"><em>Stientje van Veldhoven</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/angela-bekkers\"><em>Angela Bekkers</em></a><em> contributed to this article.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>Amid global climate-action promises, many countries have pledged to restore degraded land and expand tree cover. Ethiopia has taken that commitment one step further.</p><p>In a landmark move, Ethiopia's government launched the Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration Special Fund, allocating 0.5% to 1% of its annual federal budget — about $40 to $80 million — to restoring degraded landscapes. Approved by the House of Peoples’ Representatives on Dec. 24, 2024, the fund positions Ethiopia as a pioneer in using federal resources to advance large-scale restoration, setting a powerful precedent for other nations across the world to follow. </p><p>The fund forms part of Ethiopia’s broader <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/partnerships/green-legacy-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Green Legacy Initiative</a> (GLI), a national program launched in 2019 to combat environmental degradation and build a greener, more climate-resilient country. By establishing a dedicated financing mechanism, the country aims to scale up its restoration efforts with sustainable public investment.</p><p>The GLI recognizes that land restoration is more than just planting trees — it can improve food security, enhance air quality, increase water availability, boost climate resilience and create jobs. Ethiopia’s approach offers a promising model for how stable public financing can drive large-scale restoration in climate-vulnerable countries. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"930\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"819\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"628\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"494\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A community-based tree planting initiative in Arsi Zone in southern Ethiopia.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/south-ethiopia_0.jpg?VersionId=lNaVbhVOFW_.MbSNI5THh4EkxZ84nbbp&itok=IgNZJsLi\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A community-based tree planting initiative in Arsi Zone in southern Ethiopia.

Through its GLI, the country exceeded its initial goals by planting over 25 billion trees in just four years, including a reported <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ethiopia-plants-over-350-million-trees-day-setting-new-world-record#:~:text=Over%20350%20million%20trees%20were%20planted%20in%20an,single%20day%20in%201,000%20sites%20across%20the%20country.\" target=\"_blank\">350 million trees</a> in a single day in August 2019, a feat believed to have set an unofficial new world record. </p><p>To date, the initiative has planted more than <a href=\"http://www.ethio-greenlegacy.et/\" target=\"_blank\">32 billion seedlings</a>, with a goal of reaching 50 billion trees by 2030. It has already generated significant social benefits, including the creation of more than 767,000 jobs in areas such as nursery management, seedling production, agroforestry and sustainable land management throughout the country —  many of them for women and youth. </p><p>Ethiopia has also made the most ambitious commitment under the African Forest Landscape Initiative <a href=\"https://afr100.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Trees_Forests_Profits_Ethiopia_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">AFR100</a>, pledging to restore 22 million hectares (84,942 square miles) of degraded land. This aligns with its broader international commitments under the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests, both of which aim to combat deforestation and promote large-scale land restoration.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"903\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"796\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"609\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"480\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"287\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A restoration site in Ethiopia\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/restoration-e_0.jpg?VersionId=HK9D1WQDsQaGO7bYoq6svPX3AYYWPytf&itok=WkbOgitH\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A restoration site in Ethiopia. Tsion Issayas/WRI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Restoration Brings a Host of Benefits</h3><p>After decades of severe deforestation, Ethiopia is beginning to reverse forest and land degradation through coordinated national efforts.  Between 2013 and 2023, the annual deforestation rate fell from 92,000 hectares (355 square miles) to 27,703 hectares (107 square miles), according to <a href=\"https://www.efd.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ETH_FOREST_COVER-_DEFORESTATION_report_final_EFD_JUNE_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.efd.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ETH_FOREST_COVER-_DEFORESTATION_report_final_EFD_JUNE_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">forest cover increased </a>from 15.5% in 2013 to 23.6% during the same period. </p><p>But there’s still much work to do. Between 2000 and 2013, Ethiopia lost an average of <a href=\"https://redd.unfccc.int/media/ethiopia_frel_3.2_final_modified_submission.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">92,000 hectares</a> (355 square miles) of forest each year. A growing population and rising demand for land continue to fuel deforestation. Land degradation costs Ethiopia an estimated <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19168-3_14\" target=\"_blank\">$4.3 billion per year </a>due to reduced agricultural productivity and loss of ecosystem services such as food production and water availability. The long-term economic losses from inaction are estimated to be <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19168-3_14\" target=\"_blank\">four times higher </a>than the cost of restoring degraded land.</p><p>Ethiopia is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. Increasingly severe droughts, floods and landslides have taken a devastating toll in the country. In 2024, landslides in the southern Gofa region caused by heavy rains were the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the country, killing <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/25/ethiopia-landslide-death-toll-rises-to-257-could-almost-double-un\" target=\"_blank\">at least 250 people</a> and displacing more than 14,000.  </p><p>Degraded and deforested landscapes increase the risk of climate-related disasters. Events like the Gofa landslides underscore the urgency for Ethiopia to build climate resilience, and land restoration is increasingly recognized as part of the solution.  </p><p>But restoration is about more than just planting trees. Delivering on the country’s restoration commitments could bring widespread environmental, social and economic gains, including: </p><ul><li><strong>Food security. </strong>Restored land can help Ethiopia improve agricultural productivity, ensuring a stable food supply for its growing population, especially in rural areas.</li><li><strong>Water access.</strong> Restoring watersheds and forests can improve Ethiopia’s water resources, essential in a country vulnerable to droughts and seasonal variability. It helps ensure more reliable access to water for communities and agriculture.</li><li><strong>Climate resilience and carbon sequestration.</strong> The country's updated <a href=\"https://ndcpartnership.org/country/eth\" target=\"_blank\">Nationally Determined Contributions</a> (NDCs) and <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/ETHIOPIA_%20LONG%20TERM%20LOW%20EMISSION%20AND%20CLIMATE%20RESILIENT%20DEVELOPMENT%20STRATEGY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Long-Term Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development Strategy</a> (LT-LEDS) recognize forest protection and landscape restoration as key pillars of its climate action.  </li><li><strong>Livelihoods.</strong> Programs like the GLI have already created thousands of jobs and will continue to provide sustainable employment opportunities in restoration activities and related industries.</li><li><strong>Economic development.</strong> Landscape restoration in Ethiopia presents an opportunity to mitigate the billions of dollars in annual economic costs of land degradation. It also helps long-term sustainable growth and reduces the need for costly disaster relief efforts.</li></ul><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-left \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"898\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1430\" />\n              <source height=\"791\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"606\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"477\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"286\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A seedling production site in Ethiopia. \" height=\"286\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/a-seedling-production-site-in-ethiopia-photo-tsion-issayas-wri.jpg?VersionId=Ov2VNI.1LhEgnb4aJ1NvL1X2uCejqnZj&itok=5Smkv2rV\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A seedling production site in Ethiopia.

Of this, 54 million hectares (208,495 square miles) were prioritized for integrated, cross-sectoral interventions due to the complex drivers of land degradation. These insights into the scale and severity of degradation were key to demonstrating the need for a dedicated special restoration fund.  </p></div><h3>Stable Financing: The Next Step in Ethiopia’s Restoration</h3><p>The new Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration Special Fund marks a significant step in Ethiopia’s restoration journey. Until now, the Green Legacy Initiative relied on regular federal and regional support without a dedicated budget. By institutionalizing the special fund, Ethiopia aims to ensure the long-term sustainability of its landscape restoration efforts while creating opportunities to mobilize additional resources and scale up restoration initiatives nationwide.</p><p>The government aims to leverage these resources to attract investment in restoration beyond federal contributions — including from regional governments, development partners, civil society organizations and private sector actors. This could help scale efforts even further, far beyond what public funds alone can support.</p><p>By demonstrating how national resources can be mobilized and institutionalized to support long-term landscape restoration, Ethiopia is setting a precedent that others could follow. This new model of restoration financing not only strengthens regional collaboration, but also accelerates collective progress toward land restoration and climate resilience in Africa’s most vulnerable landscapes. </p>",

Nationally, only about <a href=\"https://asrtu.org/resource/front/uploads/STUs%20Fleet%20Book%202024.pdf\">47,650 buses serve its urban residents</a>. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities (like Delhi and Mumbai), which represent only a quarter of India’s urban population. In contrast, <a href=\"https://shaktifoundation.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Annex-1-National-Investment-program-for-bus-based-public-transport-systems-in-India.pdf#page=31.07\">cities with populations between 300,000 and 4 million remain largely underserved</a>, with many lacking organized public bus systems. Closing this gap is critical to ensure that growing cities outside of megacities, have access to reliable, inclusive and sustainable transit.</p><p>Well-established electric bus networks, which can complement the country’s rail networks and citywide metro systems, can play a massive and cost-effective role.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"853\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1280\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"506\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"New electric buses are lined up in several rows.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/new-electric-buses-india_0.jpg?VersionId=saqAVspxkGz35oVlAhDUEL0yBow9_oKd&itok=zHRz04g9\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Expanding electric buses to smaller cities will help India meet its goal to be energy independent by 2047.

However, at the time, this support was limited to the procurement of traditional gas- or diesel-fueled buses due to lower operational costs in 2021. Among India’s transport sector, <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=102799#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20All%20India,UVs)%20and%203%2Dwheelers.\">which consumes nearly 70% of India’s diesel</a>, buses already account for nearly 10% of it.</p><p>As lower costs were realized in electric bus operations, a new strategy was adopted in August 2023 by India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs that prioritized electric buses with equity, sustainability and efficiency of India’s bus system. <a href=\"https://mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/PM-eBus-Sewa-Guidelines-Part-I.pdf\">The PM-eBus Sewa Scheme</a> allocated $2.4 billion to deploy and operate 10,000 electric buses across 169 cities. This program also extends beyond the typical one-time financial assistance for bus purchases and assists with operational costs for 10 years as part of a public-private partnership model that includes bus depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure.</p><p>India’s government then <a href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-pm-electric-drive-revolution-in-innovative-vehicle-enhancement-pm-e-drive-scheme-with-an-outlay-of-rs-10900-crore-over-a-period-of-two-years/\">approved the scheme</a> in September 2024, which included incentives for more than 14,000 electric buses across nine major cities with populations exceeding 4 million people.</p><p>Currently, 10,000 electric buses have been deployed in more than 50 cities and 20,000 electric buses are in various stages of procurement.  </p><p>This brings the current commitment to 30,000 electric buses, a significant step toward cleaner urban transport. To fully realize India's 2047 vision for energy independence and sustainable mobility, continued expansion and strategic deployment of an even larger electric bus fleet will be crucial, particularly in bridging service gaps in smaller cities.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Buses crowd into a Karnataka bus station.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/crowded-bangalore-bus-station_0.jpg?VersionId=B1xaiyeNeiuBhx0_2_ZE1SQzvTNCcgrD&itok=_s8m11N9\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Buses crowd into a Bengaluru station during morning rush hour.

While this may improve conditions within those metros, it can deepen disparities with smaller urban areas that receive less attention.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>By targeting underserved smaller and medium-sized cities, resources can be divided more equitably. For example, the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme promotes more geographically balanced economic development and expands access to essential services.</p><p>Research shows that countries with a strong system of secondary cities tend to experience lower regional disparities — and <a href=\"https://www.citiesalliance.org/newsroom/news/cities-alliance-news/top-ten-reasons-focus-secondary-cities\">higher national productivity</a> — offering lessons for fast growing nations like India.  </p><p>Another way to apply an equity lens to transit investments is by looking at economic opportunities for women. Women make up 48% of the population in cities eligible under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme yet often face limited transportation options. Electric buses offer safer, cleaner and more affordable mobility.</p><p>To reassure the safety of public buses and encourage more female ridership, operator contracts now include a minimum target of 25% female representation in the workforce. As one female electric bus driver from Mumbai noted: “If a woman is driving an e-bus, then more women passengers are encouraged to travel by the bus.”</p><p>The initial rollout of 10,000 electric buses is estimated to generate between 45,000 and 55,000 new jobs. Greater gender parity among electric bus staff can also broaden women’s employment options while improving rider confidence — especially for women who travel alone.</p><h4>Extending Financial Support to Operational Expenses</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>Cities often struggle to cover the operational expenses required for reliable electric bus service. In fact, many public transit agencies struggle to recover full operating costs.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>Extending grants to cover operating costs was a key part of the success behind the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme. It extended financial support beyond capital expenditure to include operational expenses, infrastructure upgrades such as charging stations and technological platforms for smoother operations. This resulted in more efficient and reliable bus networks, while ensuring sustainability of their long-term operations.</p><h4>Reducing Financial Risks</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>Many bus operators are small — owning fewer than 100 vehicles — and have lower credit ratings, which translates to higher interest rates, higher costs and the potential of payment defaults. Under the current Gross Cost Contract model, operators bear the burden of upfront capital cost of electric buses for public transit agencies with monthly payments.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>Extending payment security mechanisms can boost the confidence to bus operators and manufacturers that they’ll receive timely payments from public transit agencies. The PM-ebus Sewa Scheme introduced a <a href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-pm-ebus-sewa-payment-security-mechanism-psm-scheme-for-procurement-and-operation-of-e-buses-by-public-transport-authorities/\">Payment Security Fund</a> that will make interim payments through an implementing agency in case of defaults by the public transit agencies.</p><h4>Building Institutional Capacity</h4><p><em><strong>Problem</strong>: </em>The nationwide rollout of electric buses is a significant undertaking requiring collaboration across departments, ministries, transportation authorities and private stakeholders. New tools, skills and capabilities, due to the nascent stage of the industry, will be needed. Meanwhile, it’s further challenged by the varying levels of knowledge and awareness throughout the government.</p><p><em><strong>Solution</strong>: </em>Capacity building and knowledge sharing focused on how to address new technologies, maintenance and infrastructure upgrades should be prioritized in the development and implementation of electric bus programs. Developing standards can help streamline this work.  WRI India collaborated with the government of India to develop the PM-ebus Sewa Scheme, establishing guidelines for deployment and a framework for demand aggregation to ensure uniform bus specifications, data standards, operational performance, procurement processes, payment guarantees, infrastructure evaluation, and safety standards. A project management unit within the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs was also created to implement and monitor the program, along with a dedicated team with specialized expertise that will facilitate smoother and more efficient roll out of the electric buses over the next two years, paving the way for expansion of the program beyond 2026.  </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Electric Buses in India are lined up at a charging station.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/electric-buses-charging-station-india_0.jpg?VersionId=Fi7XyLtsZXcSUbnaNYVFutaGQHWY5W0v&itok=mnEbC4Tv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Electric buses are lined up at a charging station in Lucknow, India.

These are cities that have historically lacked organized, affordable and clean public transit options. The adoption of electric buses will reduce dependence on fossil fuels and could reduce millions of tons of emissions over a decade, based on lifecycle estimates. Moreover, expanding the public transport network will grant better access to education, health services and jobs — outcomes that matter most in smaller urban areas where walkability and job density are lower.</p><p>However, the successful adoption of electric buses on a nationwide level requires concerted efforts that overcome challenges including financing, declining transit ridership, and grid resiliency and capacity.</p><p>In countries like India, where a majority of buses are owned by small-scale operators owning less than 100 buses, the higher cost of electric buses poses financial hurdles. Solutions could include demand aggregation to take advantage of economies of scale while purchasing electric -buses and establishing more conducive financing and lending ecosystems for small operators.</p><p>In addition, the mere deployment of more buses will not be enough. With <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e9c8cfe-6d31-4201-b807-8d304e1e4fa9\">public transit ridership remaining stagnant</a> globally over the past decade, cities must leverage technology and data to improve planning, routing and scheduling of buses to improve reliability and encourage behavior change among passengers. Moreover, bus network expansion must be paired with improved last-mile connectivity, including safer pedestrian infrastructure and better street design — especially in smaller cities, where these supporting systems are often weakest.</p><p>Lastly, an increase in electric buses means an increase in electricity demand. However, India is still largely dependent on fossil fuels for its electricity generation, with only <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/india-renewable-energy\">25% of its electricity produced from non-fossil fuel sources.</a> As a result, while electric buses play a critical role in reducing tail pipe emission, to ensure a reduction in total emissions, a larger part of the electric grid must be fueled by renewable sources, a transition process that is still likely to take decades.  </p><h3>The Road Ahead</h3><p>Over the past three years, India has laid the foundation to scale electric bus adoption. The PM-eBus Sewa Scheme advances cleaner, more inclusive mobility by focusing on underserved cities, women’s employment and long-term reforms.</p><p>To deliver on its promise, continued investment in planning, grid upgrades and local capacity is essential — ensuring electric buses support both development and climate goals. WRI India, in an effort to continue this momentum, is working to expand the scheme to 50,000 electric buses nationwide by 2027. To truly reshape India’s mobility landscape, this expansion must continue to focus on smaller cities — where the gaps are greatest and the opportunity for inclusive development is the strongest. With the right mix of policy, investment and local capacity, India’s electric bus transition can redefine public mobility — not only for megacities, but for every city on its growth journey.</p><p><em>WRI India’s </em><a href=\"https://wri-india.org/profile/chintan-daftardar\"><em>Chintan Daftardar</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://wri-india.org/profile/aparna-vijaykumar\"><em>Aparna Vijaykumar</em></a><em>, and </em><a href=\"https://wri-india.org/profile/avinash-dubedi\"><em>Avinash Dubedi</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p><p><em>This article is a part of WRI’s  </em><a href=\"https://wrirosscities.org/our-work/project-city/fedex-embarq-mobility-and-accessibility-program\"><em>Mobility and Accessibility Program</em></a><em>, which enhances global mass transit via local capacity building and action.

      "description": "<p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">New data shows fires triggered unprecedented global forest loss in 2024, releasing more than four times the emissions from all air travel in 2023 </span></em><span lang=\"EN-US\">— </span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">with devastating impacts on people and the climate, according to Global Forest Watch's annual analysis</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>WASHINGTON D.C. (May 21, 2025) </strong>— Global forest loss surged to record highs in 2024, driven by a catastrophic rise in fires, according to new data from the University of Maryland’s GLAD Lab, made available on World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch platform. Loss of tropical primary forests alone reached 6.7 million hectares — nearly twice as much as in 2023 and an area nearly the size of Panama, at the rate of 18 soccer fields every minute.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">For the first time on our record, fires — not agriculture — were the leading cause of tropical primary forest loss, accounting for nearly 50% of all destruction. This marks a dramatic shift from recent years, when fires averaged just 20%. Meanwhile, tropical primary forest loss driven by other causes also jumped by 14%, the sharpest increase since 2016. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Despite some positive developments, particularly in Southeast Asia, the overall trend is heading in a troubling direction. Leaders of over 140 countries signed the </span><a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230418175226/https:/ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Glasgow Leaders Declaration in 2021</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">, promising to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030. But we are alarmingly off track to meet this commitment: Of the 20 countries with the largest area of primary forest, 17 have higher primary forest loss today than when the agreement was signed.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The consequences of forest loss in 2024 have been devastating for both people and the planet. Globally, the fires emitted 4.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions — releasing more than 4 times the emissions from all air travel in 2023. The fires worsened air quality, strained water supplies and threatened the lives and livelihoods of millions.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Elizabeth Goldman, Co-Director, WRI’s Global Forest Watch said:</strong> \"This level of forest loss is unlike anything we've seen in over 20 years of data. It's a global red alert — a collective call to action for every country, every business and every person who cares about a livable planet. Our economies, our communities, our health — none of it can survive without forests.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">While fires are natural in some ecosystems, those in tropical forests are mostly human-caused, often set on agricultural land or to prepare new areas for farming. In 2024, the hottest year on record, extreme conditions fueled by climate change and El Niño made these fires more intense and harder to control. Although forests have the ability to recover from fire, the combined pressures of land conversion and a changing climate can hinder that recovery and raise the likelihood of future fires.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Top Countries for Forest Loss</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Brazil, the country with the largest area of tropical forest, accounted for 42% of all tropical primary forest loss in 2024. Fires, fueled by the worst drought on record, caused 66% of that loss — an over sixfold increase from 2023. Primary forest loss from other causes also rose by 13%, mostly due to large-scale farming for soy and cattle, though still lower than the peaks seen in the early 2000s and in the Bolsonaro era. The Amazon experienced its highest tree cover loss since 2016, while the Pantanal suffered the highest percentage of tree cover loss in the country.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Mariana Oliveira, Director Forests and Land Use Program, WRI Brasil said: </strong>“Brazil has made progress under President Lula — but the threat to forests remains. Without sustained investment in community fire prevention, stronger state-level enforcement and a focus on sustainable land use, hard-won gains risk being undone. As Brazil prepares to host COP30, it has a powerful opportunity to put forest protection front and center on the global stage.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Bolivia's primary forest loss skyrocketed by 200% in 2024, totaling 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres). For the first time, it ranked second for tropical primary forest loss only to Brazil, overtaking the Democratic Republic of Congo despite having less than half its forest area. More than half the loss was due to fires, often set to clear land for soy, cattle, and sugarcane, which turned into megafires due to heavy drought. Government policies promoting agricultural expansion worsened the problem.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Stasiek Czaplicki Cabezas, Bolivian researcher and Data Journalist for Revista Nomadas, said:</strong> “The fires that tore through Bolivia in 2024 left deep scars — not only on the land, but on the people who depend on it. The damage could take centuries to undo. Across the tropics, we need stronger fire response systems and a shift away from policies that encourage dangerous land clearing, or this pattern of destruction will only get worse.\" </span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In Colombia, primary forest loss increased by nearly 50%. However, unlike elsewhere in Latin America, fires were not the primary cause. Instead, non-fire-related loss rose by 53%, owing to instability from the breakdown in peace talks, including illegal mining and coca production.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Joaquin Carrizosa, Senior Advisor, WRI Colombia said: </strong>“In 2023, Colombia saw the biggest drop in primary forest loss in 20 years, proving that when government and communities work together, real change is possible. The rise in primary forest loss in 2024 is a setback, but it shouldn’t discourage us as a country. We need to keep supporting local, nature-based economies – especially in remote areas – and invest in solutions that protect the environment, create jobs and foster peace.\"</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In 2024, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo (ROC) saw the highest levels of primary forest loss on record. In the ROC, primary forest loss surged by 150% compared to the previous year, with fires causing 45% of the damage, worsened by unusually hot and dry conditions. Like the Amazon, the Congo Basin plays a crucial role as a carbon sink, but the rising fires and forest loss now threaten its vital function. In the DRC, poverty, reliance on forests for food and energy and ongoing conflict driven by rebel groups have fueled instability and led to increased land clearing, further driving forest loss.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Teodyl Nkuintchua, Congo Basin Strategy & Engagement Lead, WRI Africa said:</strong> “The high rates of forest loss in the DRC reflect the tough realities our communities are facing — poverty, conflict and a deep reliance on forests for survival. There’s no silver bullet, but we won't change the current trajectory until people across the Congo Basin are fully empowered to lead conservation efforts that also support their rural economies.”</span></em> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Dr. Matt Hansen, Professor, University of Maryland; Co-Director, Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) Lab said: </strong>\"We’re seeing unprecedented forest loss from fire in the few remaining ‘High Forest, Low Deforestation’ countries, like the Republic of Congo. This new dynamic is outside of current policy frameworks or intervention capabilities and will severely test our ability to maintain intact forests within a warming climate.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">However, it's not all bad news. In Southeast Asia, there are signs of progress. Indonesia reduced primary forest loss by 11%, reversing a steady rise between 2021 and 2023. Efforts under former President Joko Widodo to restore land and curb fires helped keep fire rates low, even amid widespread droughts. Similarly, Malaysia saw a 13% decline and fell out of the top 10 countries for tropical primary forest loss for the first time.</span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Arief Wijaya, Managing Director, WRI Indonesia said</strong>: “We're proud that Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world to reduce primary forest loss. But deforestation remains a concern due to plantations, small-scale farming and mining — even within protected areas. We hope the current administration keeps the momentum going\". </span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The rise in forest loss also extended beyond the tropics. The world saw a 5% increase in total tree cover loss compared to 2023, adding up to 30 million hectares — an area the size of Italy. This increase was driven in part by the intense fire seasons in Canada and Russia, marking the first time that major fires raged across both the tropics and boreal forests since GFW’s record-keeping began.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Combatting Forest Loss</strong></span> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Peter Potapov, Research Professor, University of Maryland; Co-Director, Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) Lab said: </strong>\"2024 was the worst year on record for fire-driven forest loss, breaking the record set just last year. If this trend continues, it could permanently transform critical natural areas and unleash large amounts of carbon — intensifying climate change and fueling even more extreme fires. This is a dangerous feedback loop we cannot afford to trigger further.\"</span></em> </p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Rod Taylor, Director, Forests and Nature Conservation, WRI said</strong>: “Forest fires and land clearing are driving up emissions, while the climate is already changing faster than forests can adapt. This crisis is pushing countless species to the brink and forcing Indigenous Peoples and local communities from their ancestral lands. But this isn’t irreversible — if governments, businesses, and individuals act now, we can stop the assault on forests and their custodians.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To meet the global goal of halting forest loss by 2030, the world must reduce deforestation by 20% every year, starting immediately. In contrast, 2024 marked an 80% increase in tropical primary forest loss. To combat this loss, the world needs action on multiple fronts: stronger fire prevention, deforestation-free supply chains for commodities, better enforcement of trade regulations and increased funding for forest protection — especially Indigenous-led initiatives.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Achieving this will require political will, national strategies tailored to local realities and greater support from wealthier nations to ensure forests remain standing — and are valued more alive than lost.</span> <br /><br /><em><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Kelly Levin, Chief of Science, Data and Systems Change, Bezos Earth Fund said:</strong></span></em><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Countries have repeatedly pledged to halt deforestation and forest degradation. Yet the data reveal a stark gap between promises made and progress delivered — alongside the growing impacts of a warming world. These findings should jolt us out of complacency. The Bezos Earth Fund is proud to support this vital tool for showing where we stand and ensuring action is grounded in evidence.”</span></em> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>About the annual Tree Cover Loss data analysis </strong></span> <br /><span lang=\"EN-US\">World Resource Institute’s Global Forest Watch provides annual tree cover loss data analysis, showing when and where forest loss occurred around the world.

      "description": "<p>People around the world are feeling the effects of climate change in the form of severe floods, long-term droughts, worsening forest fires, intensifying storms, extreme heat and more. It's essential that communities invest in reducing and avoiding these impacts. For example, improved building methods can be the difference between a house withstanding a storm or crumbling to rubble.</p><p>The critical question is: How do we pay for it?</p><p>This is where <strong>adaptation finance</strong> comes in.</p><p>Particularly in low-income countries, adaptation finance is sorely needed to help make people — and the infrastructure and ecosystems they rely on — more resilient to the impacts of climate change. Yet with each passing year the gap between the adaptation finance needed and what is available grows.</p><p>Closing this gap is essential as climate change continues to escalate. But there are varying definitions about what counts as adaptation finance, as well as different means of providing and tracking funds. Here, we answer key questions:</p><h3>1) What Is Adaptation Finance?</h3><p>Adaptation finance is aimed at helping communities reduce the risks they face and harm they might suffer from climate hazards like storms or droughts. It pays for things like strengthening housing and infrastructure to withstand extreme weather; developing drought-tolerant crops; creating social safety nets (like cash, food or insurance to help with recovery from climate-related disasters); or improving access to climate information for better management of climate-related risks.</p><p>Adaptation finance includes funds flowing from developed to developing countries as well as finance that governments — in both developing and developed countries — invest to build resilience to climate impacts within their own borders. Adaptation finance can also come from private sources, such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/philanthropy-adaptation-finance-developing-countries\">philanthropies</a>, corporations and financial institutions. Businesses are increasingly investing in adaptation to protect their operations, supply chains and markets from exposure to climate-related risks.</p><p>Adaptation finance often overlaps with development finance, as investments aimed at reducing communities' economic or social vulnerability often also enhance resilience to climate change, in addition to other benefits. However, for funding to be classified as adaptation finance, it must be explicitly intended to enhance <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction\">resilience to actual or expected climate risks</a>.</p><p>For example, funding a new road may boost a community's resilience by making it easier for people to access markets, hospitals and assistance during extreme weather. To count as adaptation finance, however, the road needs to be deliberately built with climate impacts and the needs of vulnerable people in mind. A vulnerability analysis could reveal the need for a more durable road so people living in informal settlements can safely evacuate ahead of severe storms. And the road would need to be situated where it will not be directly exposed to storm surges and erosion, or elevated so that it remains passable when flooding occurs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cars on a partially submerged highway after a flood.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/typhoon-yagi_0.jpg?VersionId=Svwj3PbQmymQnTxB6Z6e7rF.FfCtehjt&itok=UJVRTL2A\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A partially submerged highway in Thailand's Chiang Rai province following Typhoon Yagi in 2024. Adaptation finance pays for activities that enhance resilience to climate impacts, such as building elevated or more durable roads that can better withstand floods and storms.

For example, the <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024\">UNEP Adaptation Finance GAP Report</a> estimates that developing countries need between $215 and $387 billion per year by 2030. The <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change#:~:text=Research%20by%20the%20IMF%20and,per%20year%20in%20coming%20decades.\">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) estimates that adaptation costs exceed 1% of GDP per year in about 50 low-income and developing economies. This rises up to 20% of GDP for small island nations exposed to acute climate hazards such as tropical cyclones and rising seas.</p><p>However, these are only broad estimates. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact amount of adaptation finance needed, as this requires assessing context-specific risks, clearly distinguishing adaptation from general development, and more accurate data collection. Uncertainties about future climate trajectories also complicate estimates, as adaptation finance needs depend in part on how successful we are at curbing global temperature rise.</p><h3>3) How Much Adaptation Finance Is Available?</h3><p>Even with fairly limited data, it's clear there's not enough adaptation finance available to meet countries' needs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2024/\">Climate Policy Initiativ</a>e (CPI) estimates that $68 billion was spent around the world on adaptation on average between 2021 and 2022. Much of this was international finance: According to <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/286dae5d-en/1/3/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/286dae5d-en&_csp_=46b868d4f630525e4ccc5f67e501847f&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book\">OECD</a>, developed countries delivered $32.4 billion in adaptation finance to developing nations in 2022.</p><p>These funding levels are many times less than what's needed — and the gap is set to increase as climate change impacts intensify. In total, the gap between current adaptation finance and what's needed in developing countries is estimated at <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/46497/AGR2024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\">$187-$359 billion per year</a>.</p><h3>4) Who Is — and Is not — Receiving Adaptation Finance?</h3><p>Evidence shows that available finance is not reaching those most vulnerable to climate impacts, who often have the fewest resources with which to adapt. According to <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-new-collective-quantified-goal-on-climate-finance_7b28309b-en.html\">OECD</a>, low-income countries received less than 10% of all climate finance provided and mobilized by developed countries between 2016 and 2022. Data from the four major multilateral climate funds — Adaptation Fund, Climate Investment Fund, Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility — also indicates that fragile and highly vulnerable countries <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/publications/climate-finance-sustaining-peace-making-climate-finance-work-conflict-affected-and-fragile-contexts\">are receiving less finance</a> than other nations.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21596160/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>One potential reason for this is that accessing adaptation finance often requires significant institutional capacity. While funding requirements vary based on the type of finance involved, they are often complex, requiring the staff, data and know-how to structure bankable adaptation initiatives. Least developed countries often lack these resources, despite having the highest need for adaptation finance. High costs of capital, driven by factors like currency and political risks, further limit access to finance.</p><h3>5) Why Does Climate Mitigation Receive More Funding than Adaptation?</h3><p>While adaptation finance has increased in recent years, it still represents <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf\">less than 10%</a> of global climate investments. The majority goes to climate change mitigation: efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and halt rising temperatures.</p><p>There are several reasons why mitigation receives more finance than adaptation. Mitigation's focus on GHG emissions not only makes it easier to define, it also makes it easier to invest in. Activities like installing solar panels or manufacturing electric vehicles bring a more immediate and certain financial return than many adaptation initiatives, which focus on building long-term resilience to extreme events that may happen further in the future. Nations may also be more inclined to invest in mitigation internationally given the contribution to global emissions reductions.</p><h3>6) Why Is Adaptation Finance Difficult to Track?</h3><p>Adaptation finance can be tricky to define and track, in large part because adaptation is highly context specific. Unlike mitigation finance, which targets a narrower set of solutions to reduce GHG emissions, adaptation requires a broad array of activities tailored to particular climate risks faced by specific locations.</p><p>There are also varying methods for tracking adaptation finance. Two of the most widely used approaches — <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/dac/environment-development/Revised%20climate%20marker%20handbook_FINAL.pdf\">OECD DAC Rio Markers</a> and <a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/20cd787e947dbf44598741469538a4ab-0020012022/original/20220242-mdbs-joint-methodology-climate-change-adaptation-finance-en.pdf\">MDB Joint Methodology for Tracking Adaptation Finance</a> — offer guidance to financial institutions and countries providing adaptation finance. While their methodologies differ somewhat, both focus on identifying whether an investment has supported climate resilience, and if so, to what degree.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/colombias-climate-finance-tracking-system-registers-6-billion-worth-action\">Some countries</a> have developed their own approaches to tracking adaptation finance and budget expenditures. These often draw from the two methodologies mentioned above but make modifications to suit national circumstances. As a result, adaptation finance provided or received by countries is not always easily comparable.</p><p>Even with methodologies in place, tracking adaptation finance is complicated. It requires funding and capacity to execute, which organizations aren't always resourced for. Moreover, spending on adaptation may occur across different units of the organization, creating a cross-cutting challenge requiring additional coordination.</p><p>Adaptation finance from the private sector is even more difficult to track because, unlike public funding, governments do not maintain centralized accounting systems for private investments. As a result, virtually no country systematically monitors how much private funding is spent on adaptation within or outside its borders.</p><h3>7) Are Developing Countries Receiving Financial Support for Adaptation?</h3><p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) governs the process by which countries come together to cooperate on climate action. Under the UNFCCC, developed countries committed to help developing countries — which contributed least to the climate crisis but often suffer the worst impacts — finance their adaptation efforts.</p><p>This commitment has led to the adoption of key climate funds (such as the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund) to channel international finance to developing countries. Developed countries also agreed under the UNFCCC to double adaptation finance from 2019 levels to roughly $40 billion by 2025. <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-in-2013-2022_19150727-en/full-report/component-2.html#chapter-d1e103-47ec524116\">As of 2022</a> (the latest data available), they had reached $32.4 billion, putting them on track to realize this goal.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Farmers among the plots of a community garden.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/climate-adaptation-farmers-gambia_0.jpg?VersionId=PR5jMfF98tm6Z.ipLo0vneTPFIMry_hg&itok=aFUEAJVB\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>In Gambia, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) helps farmers develop methods that are more resilient to climate impacts like rising temperatures and erratic rainfall. International support is an important source of funding for developing nations to pursue climate adaptation. Photo by UNEP/Flickr</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Most recently, at the 2024 UN climate summit (COP29), countries agreed to a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ncqg-climate-finance-goals-explained\">New Collective Quantified Goal</a> (NCQG) on climate finance. Parties committed to deliver $300 billion — with efforts to reach $1.3 trillion — for climate action in developing countries by 2035, aiming for a balance between mitigation and adaptation finance. The NCQG also acknowledges the need to improve the quality of adaptation finance, particularly the need for grant-based resources and highly concessional (affordable) finance that does not exacerbate existing debt burdens.</p><h3>8) How Much Adaptation Finance Comes from the Private Sector?</h3><p>While private sector finance for adaptation is especially difficult to track, the data that is available shows it's particularly limited. For example, of the climate finance that the CPI has been able to track, <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf\">approximately 90%</a> of adaptation finance was provided through public actors.</p><p>There are several reasons for this. Adaptation projects often bring broad social benefits, but clear financial returns for private investors may be difficult to discern. Many vulnerable communities are also located in areas perceived as too risky for private investment, including areas suffering from conflict or other forms of instability. Other times, private investments in resilience are not made simply due to uncertainty about which adaptation options to invest in or a lack of long-term planning, technical capacity and data.</p><p>Private investment in adaptation needs to be scaled up, as public funding alone will not be enough to close the adaptation finance gap and meet the large and growing need for climate resilience. Private companies finance, build and maintain vital infrastructure, supply chains and markets. It is essential that they integrate climate resilience into their investment decisions and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/private-sector-climate-adaptation-finance\">explore innovative financial instruments</a> to expand collaboration with the public sector. Governments can help by creating incentives and risk-sharing mechanisms to accelerate private investments in adaptation-related activities.</p><h3>9) How Is Adaptation Finance Being Provided?</h3><p>The majority — <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf\">around 76%</a> — of adaptation finance to emerging market and developing economies (excluding least developed countries) is provided in the form of non-concessional finance. Least developed countries, for their part, tend to receive a majority of their funding in the form of grants. Some countries have opted to turn down loans for climate-related activities to avoid adding further debt to their balance sheets. Any efforts to scale up adaptation finance should also aim to ensure that the right type of funding is matched with the right types of projects.</p><h3>10) What Is the Relationship between Adaptation Finance and Finance for Loss and Damage?</h3><p>Funding for <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loss-damage-climate-change\">\"loss and damage\"</a> — climate impacts that go beyond what people can adapt to — is an important discussion point in climate negotiations. Finance for loss and damage and for adaptation are closely related, as both aim to help communities deal with the costs associated with climate impacts. The main difference between the two is that adaptation finance is intended to help communities <em>prepare for and reduce potential impacts</em>, while loss and damage finance primarily pays for <em>losses that occur despite investments in resilience</em>. Investing in climate adaptation can help reduce loss and damage costs down the line.</p><h3>Next Steps for Scaling Adaptation Finance</h3><p>Growing adaptation finance will require stronger political commitments and more institutional capacity in both the public and private sectors. Better data on the economic and social risks posed by climate change, as well as on the financial and economic returns of adaptation projects, is also essential to increasing investments. This information would help countries, donors and the private sector agree on adaptation priorities, track adaptation finance and integrate adaptation priorities into national planning.</p><p>The 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil presents a crucial opportunity to elevate the case for adaptation finance, building on recent momentum to secure stronger commitments and bridge the global finance gap. In Belém, the current and previous COP hosts will present a roadmap for reaching the NCQG's $1.3 trillion target, which parties hope will provide clear guidance on scaling up adaptation finance. Negotiators will also decide on a set of indicators to track progress on the Paris Agreement's <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-goal-on-adaptation-explained\">Global Goal on Adaptation</a>. Including credible finance-related indicators will be essential for holding parties accountable to their adaptation goals and driving real change for those on the front lines of the climate crisis.</p><p>At COP30 and beyond, countries must scale up adaptation finance to support those already affected by climate change and prepare for the impacts yet to come. Doing so is a strategic investment that, via broad social, economic and environmental benefits, will contribute to global stability and prosperity.</p>",
