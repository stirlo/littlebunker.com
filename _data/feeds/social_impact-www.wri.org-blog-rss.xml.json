      "link": "https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/6-opportunities-sustainable-finance-2026",
      "pubDate": "Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:53:39 EST",
      "description": "<p>2026 is set to be another year of clashing trends in sustainable finance, particularly for emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), where the greatest capital shift needs to take place.</p><p>Last year, the world poured record levels of money into <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/bloombergnef-finds-global-energy-transition-investment-reached-record-2-3-trillion-in-2025-up-8-from-2024/\">clean energy investments</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-26/green-debt-sales-hit-record-levels\">green bonds and loans</a> hit an all-time high. But those tailwinds were matched by severe cuts in international public climate finance (most notably in the U.S.) as well as some countries watering down ESG regulations. Rather than derailing underlying momentum, however, these headwinds have sharpened the focus on where a rebound in leadership, innovation and coordination is most urgently needed.</p><p>We identified six strategic opportunities in 2026 for public and private investors to scale up finance needed to address the climate crisis, protect nature and improve people’s lives.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Three people installing a solar panel on a roof.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/solar-installation-south-africa_0.jpg?VersionId=qDLLY_T..gOBqCJEOSfmSpen3QSalxNP&itok=Rv2LQulq\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>In South Africa, technicians install a rooftop solar array. Photo by PixelCatchers/iStock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>1) Generating Policy Leadership to Implement the New Finance Roadmap</h3><p>Against the odds, the 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) solidified the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/650953\">Baku to Belém (B2B) Roadmap</a>. This lays out a comprehensive strategy to meet the ambitious global goal agreed at COP29: delivering $1.3 trillion a year in international finance to EMDCs for clean energy, adaptation, nature, just transition, and loss and damage by 2035.</p><p>In 2026, the focus must shift to implementation so that progress can be demonstrated by COP31 this November. This will, of course, be aided by leadership from the key international bodies for financial governance. However, the G20 is set to be missing in action as a driver of sustainable finance and climate this year under the U.S. presidency. At the high-income G7 summit, France — this year’s chair — will undoubtedly aim to broaden the dialogue with EMDCs and make progress on several granular areas of climate finance (possibly including prudential regulation). This leaves the <a href=\"https://www.brics2026.gov.in/\">BRICS</a>, with its 11 major EMDCs, with a chance to pick up the baton. Under India’s leadership this year, the group can deepen its <a href=\"https://brics.br/en/brics-leaders-champion-global-effort-for-fair-climate-finance-in-historic-rio-declaration\">2025 commitment</a> to “lead a global mobilization for a fairer and more effective International Monetary and Financial System to enhance climate finance.” (We examine opportunities for South-South cooperation in more detail <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/#south-south\">below</a>.)</p><p>Beyond high-level summits, 2026 needs to see governments and stakeholders turn to the nuts and bolts of implementing new finance commitments. Across its more than 100 member countries, the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action will give attention to expanding fiscal space in developing countries, increasing adaptation finance and supporting the new generation of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\">country platforms</a>. Meanwhile, the central bank and regulator Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is deepening its focus on the short-term risks of climate inaction for growth, financial stability and inflation.</p><h3>2) Rebooting Private Finance Flows</h3><p>One of the biggest tasks for 2026 will be to show how the B2B Roadmap’s heroic goals for expanding private finance can be achieved over the next decade. <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IHLEG-on-Climate-Finance-4th-Report-Delivering-an-integrated-climate-finance-agenda.pdf\">Half of the $1.3 trillion</a> in external flows needs to come from private sources by 2035, according to the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG) — up 16 times from the $40 billion delivered in 2022. And of the $1.9 trillion needed from domestic sources, 40% must come from the private sector (including households), a ninefold expansion from today’s levels.</p><p>The good news is that 2026 opens with core banking, investor and insurance commitments on climate and nature finance relatively robust, despite well-publicized attacks and the shuttering of net-zero alliances for banking and insurance. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/nzam-ready-for-its-next-chapter/\">Net Zero Asset Management (NZAM) initiative</a> will be relaunched early in the year. Leading asset owners have also helped to restore confidence through new allocations to sustainability themes: According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/institutional-investor-sustainability-signals-report-2025\">Morgan Stanley survey</a>, 86% of asset owners in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific expect to increase allocations to sustainable investments in the next two years.</p><p>2026 offers several key opportunities to continue increasing private finance flows:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.com/news/global-clean-power-alliance-finance-mission-publishes-global-roadmap-to-scale-private-finance-for-clean-energy-transitions-in-emerging-markets/\">Expanding private investment</a> in clean electrification in the developing countries that continue to miss out, notably in Africa. This will often require investors to work closely with multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) in the construction of bankable pipelines, platforms and policies, as well as placing a priority on worker and community benefits.</li><li>Overcoming the structural challenges facing blended finance to make it more efficient and impactful in mobilizing private capital. In 2026, the multi-country <a href=\"https://scaledevelopment.org/\">SCALED initiative</a> is set to move into its second phase of standardizing blended finance requirements, vehicle types and processes.</li><li>Aligning finance flows with nature. The next UN biodiversity summit (COP17) in October will focus attention on how to both meaningfully increase the still-tiny <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2026\">private finance flows into nature-based solutions</a> (currently around $23 billion) and structurally curb the far-larger $4.9 trillion in private capital directed into nature-negative activities.</li><li>Attracting private finance to adaptation. While <a href=\"https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P2_WRI-Scaling-Finance-for-Climate-Adaptation.pdf\">adaptation finance</a> has historically been viewed as a solely public sector priority, we expect this year to bring increasing evidence of private sector adaptation financing, including through resilience bonds.</li><li>Bringing taxonomies closer together. In terms of financial plumbing, last year’s climate summit successfully launched a set of <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/publications/principles-for-taxonomy-interoperability/\">common principles</a> to make the world’s more than 50 sustainable taxonomies interoperable. There’s opportunity to build on this in 2026, which could cut barriers to sustainable finance that stem from unnecessary definitional differences and help to further reduce transaction costs.</li><li>Closing the insurance protection gap. One of the most specific of the B2B Roadmap’s short-term priorities is for the insurance industry to work with climate-vulnerable developing countries in the V20 and beyond, as well as donor governments, to reduce the financial protection gap. The goal is to deliver a plan by October 2026 that would show how a set of pre-arranged tools could be designed to ensure that funds reach people and enterprises immediately after disasters.</li></ul><h3>3) Reviving Concessional Finance</h3><p>The B2B Roadmap reemphasized the perennial need for “developed countries to achieve manyfold increases in the delivery of grants and concessional climate finance.” But the availability of concessional funding will continue to face downward pressure in 2026, with previously announced cuts to development finance (ODA) from the U.S. and most other OECD countries further squeezing the available resources for climate action. One projection from <a href=\"https://donortracker.org/publications/budget-cuts-tracker\">Donor Tracker</a> suggests that ODA will fall from a peak of $213 billion in 2023 to just $145 billion in 2026.</p><p>Visible progress will be needed from MDBs, bilateral development finance institutions and others to expand the quantum of concessional capital by stretching balance sheets, hybrid capital and other measures. As part of the mix, the proportion of concessional funds flowing to resilience needs to be increased in line with the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/tripling-adaptation-finance-goal\">tripling goal for 2035</a> agreed at COP30. The various soul-searching reviews of international finance currently underway also provide scope for development, climate and nature finance across MDBs, vertical climate funds and bilateral mechanisms to work better together as a coherent, well-allocated whole.</p><p>One particular opportunity for progress is to expand the number of countries backing the Premium Flyers Solidarity Coalition. The goal of the Coalition is to introduce <a href=\"https://solidaritylevies.org/\">levies</a> on business class, first class and private jets as a way to channel new climate and development finance to EMDCs.</p><p>Another focus will be driving deployment of existing instruments that can make concessional funds go farther, both in terms of leveraging additional investment and securing maximum impact. This will be a major test for the growing focus on development finance to be “ <a href=\"https://www.bii.co.uk/en/news-insight/insight/articles/driving-market-level-changes-in-impact-investing/\">market shaping</a>,” “ <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/publications/transformational-finance-for-climate-unlocking-systemic-effects/\">transformational </a>” and “ <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/what-systemic-investing-and-why-are-impact-investors-taking-notice\">systemic</a>.” There is no shortage of available mechanisms that need to move into an expansion phase this year. One cluster is the more than 50 <a href=\"https://greenguaranteedirectory.org/\">green guarantee</a> structures now in existence, such as the World Bank Group’s <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/brief/guarantees-platform\">Guarantee Platform</a>, which consolidates products at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), freeing up lending for climate finance.</p><p>Another approach is the growing use of structured products as a way of tapping bond markets to generate a flow of concessional capital. For example, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF)’s <a href=\"https://www.cif.org/news/ccmm-issuance\">Capital Markets Mechanism</a> issued a first-of-its kind <a href=\"https://www.cif.org/news/ccmm-issuance\">$500 million bond</a> last year to frontload funding for climate technologies. Further bond issues in 2026 would be a positive sign of momentum. The <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/financing-nature-conservation-tropical-forest-forever-facility\">Tropical Forests Forever Facility</a> (TFFF), championed by Brazil at COP30, is a much larger model, <a href=\"https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/a-$125bn-plan-to-monetize-forest-conservation.html\">aiming to raise $100 billion</a> through the issuance of highly-rated bonds along with $25 billion in public and philanthropic capital (which would absorb losses in a blended finance approach). This pool would then be invested to generate $4 billion per year for tropical countries, with at least 20% of payments directed to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. A key test for the TFFF in 2026 will be whether it can achieve critical mass in securing the upfront public funds it needs, building on the $6.6 billion secured at COP30.</p><h3>4) Adding Urgency to Transition Finance</h3><p>The long-waited introduction of the EU’s <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en\">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism </a>(CBAM) on the first day of 2026 has lent new urgency to the transition finance agenda in developing countries. The CBAM introduces a charge on imports into the EU based on carbon performance, matching the price paid by domestic companies through the European Emissions Trading System (ETS). This means companies in affected sectors — cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, hydrogen and electricity — will increasingly be seeking financing options for new modes of production that can cut emissions and thereby avoid carbon costs.</p><p>Another policy trigger spurring transition finance will be the intensifying focus on how to speed up fossil fuel phaseout. In April, Colombia will host the first global conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels, in partnership with the Netherlands. This will bring together the growing number of countries seeking to accelerate clean energy deployment, diversify their economies from coal, oil and gas, and thereby avoid stranded assets and stranded communities. Alongside this, Brazil is driving a domestic strategy to transition away from fossil fuels (TAFF) and will lead a dialogue through to COP31 for a coordinated international approach to TAFF.</p><p>All this will place increased pressure on business to develop credible transition plans and transition finance instruments. Here, the main arena to watch in 2026 will be the market take-up of the <a href=\"https://www.icmagroup.org/sustainable-finance/the-principles-guidelines-and-handbooks/climate-transition-finance-handbook/\">recently launched guidance</a> on dedicated transition <a href=\"https://www.icmagroup.org/sustainable-finance/the-principles-guidelines-and-handbooks/climate-transition-finance-handbook/\">bonds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lsta.org/content/transition-loans-guide/\">loans</a> from the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), the Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA). Critical to this will be closing the gap between different national benchmarks of credible transition performance for key low-carbon products.</p><h3>5) Boosting Climate Innovation Ecosystems</h3><p>At the other end of the investment spectrum from today’s incumbent fossil fuel technologies lie the diverse ecosystems of climate innovation. Climate tech businesses around clean energy, battery storage and sustainable mobility <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-15/global-climate-tech-is-attracting-more-investors-than-pre-trump\">attracted $56 billion</a> in the first nine months of 2025, more than they did in all of 2024.</p><p>This finance remains unevenly spread, however. While climate tech investment in Africa <a href=\"https://insights.techcabal.com/africas-climatetech-in-2025-funding-trends-startups-scale/\">rose to upwards of $1 billion last year</a>, funding tended to flow to larger, more proven businesses. Continued declines in global ODA will likely mean further reductions in international grants for early-stage climate ventures.</p><p>As EMDCs advance their ambitions of becoming high-income economies, they will be looking for opportunities to boost private sector productivity and provide value-added links to global supply chains. In parallel, many are working to scale sustainable solutions to meet their climate targets. This year, we could see an increase in national policies geared toward boosting local green innovation that can attract commercial investment, especially in EMDCs where this is a priority. One example is <a href=\"https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1719592/resolutions-57-and-68-poised-to-drive-private-sector-growth.html\">Vietnam’s resolutions 57 and 68</a>, agenda-setting frameworks that prioritize private sector-led innovation to boost economic growth.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\"><strong>Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G)</strong> provides grants and technical assistance to help early-stage climate startups in EMDCs become investment ready. The initiative works with public-private platforms to improve enabling market conditions for startups in Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, South Africa and Vietnam. P4G is hosted by WRI and funded by Denmark, the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/partnership-green-growth-and-global-goals-p4g\">Learn more.</a></p></div><p>EMDCs may look for ways to increase the volume of their climate pipelines by integrating them with other sectors that are currently attracting investment, such as linking data centers to renewable energy sources. Additionally, we are likely to see global supply chains begin to shift as many countries look to diversify to new suppliers, creating further opportunities for green start-ups in EMDEs.</p><p>Based on the high emphasis placed on adaptation during COP30, as well as rising costs and risks of the physical impacts of climate change, we will likely see investors prioritize investments in startups focused on building climate resilience. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop30-outcomes-next-steps\">adoption of adaptation indicators</a> at COP30, while needing additional refinement, and the emergence of <a href=\"https://www.climatebonds.net/expertise/resilience-finance\">voluntary investment frameworks</a> will help establish a standardized way to measure progress and allow for clearer investment opportunities.</p><h3 id=\"south-south\">6) Charting the New Role of South-South Finance</h3><p>In the past, international climate finance discussions have largely focused on North-South flows and domestic resource mobilization. But today’s geoeconomic turbulence makes South-South financial cooperation an increasingly critical arena. Already, South-South climate cooperation amounts to about $17 billion a year — greater than direct flows of international private capital, <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IHLEG-on-Climate-Finance-4th-Report-Delivering-an-integrated-climate-finance-agenda.pdf\">according to IHLEG</a>.</p><p>At COP29 in Baku, governments agreed that South-South cooperation would form a voluntary component of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance. This inclusion reflects a paradigm shift: Developing countries are not only recipients, but also contributors to global climate solutions. While these contributions remain non-obligatory, they signal a growing commitment among EMDCs to share resources and expertise, reinforcing solidarity and mutual responsibility in addressing climate and development challenges.</p><p>These collaborations amongst the BRICS, least developed countries and the capital hubs of the Gulf not only mobilize resources, but also foster knowledge exchange and capacity building tailored to the unique challenges faced by emerging economies. As clean-economy opportunities increase and climate impacts intensify, the role of South-South finance in bridging gaps and accelerating action has never been more vital.</p><p>For 2026, the BRICS has signaled its intent to deepen collaboration on climate finance, creating a platform for emerging economies to pool resources and share best practices. This year, expect discussions on operationalizing joint investment vehicles and green bond markets under this framework. These efforts could unlock significant capital for renewable energy, resilient infrastructure and low-carbon technologies across the BRICS member states and beyond.</p><p>One crucial institution to watch is the youngest MDB, the <a href=\"https://www.ndb.int/event/new-development-bank-at-the-30th-united-nations-climate-change-conference/\">New Development Bank</a>, set up by the BRICS a decade ago. As part of its 2022-2026 Strategy, the Bank committed to dedicate at least 40% of its portfolio to climate-related finance as well as 30% in local currencies. The latest data presented at COP30 shows that climate finance is 31% of the bank’s total portfolio (excluding COVID loans). But the pace is stepping up, with climate accounting for over 55% of approvals in 2024. These goals open the door for large-scale investments in clean energy, sustainable transport and resilience projects across BRICS and other partner countries, and the potential for increased climate ambition in the NDB’s next strategy. Leveraging this commitment will require coordinated pipelines of bankable projects and innovative financing structures to maximize impact.</p><p>While South-South cooperation is gaining prominence, it is not — and should not be viewed as — a stand-alone channel separate from other international flows. In practice, these financial contributions are often channeled through existing multilateral institutions and implemented in partnership with traditional donor countries. This interconnected approach ensures that resources are deployed efficiently and aligned with global priorities. The real opportunity to watch in 2026 is how South-South cooperation can become an integral part of global climate finance architecture — working together with North-South structures to scale up implementation of the B2B Roadmap.</p><h3>From Commitment to Deployment</h3><p>These six opportunities are just some of the areas where we could see real movement toward a more sustainable financial system. Ultimately, progress in 2026 will depend less on new pledges and more on execution: translating roadmaps into monitored action, commitments into deployment, and partnerships into measurable impact for people, nature and climate.</p>",

      "title": "A Milestone for Data-Driven Climate Action: Ethiopia Launches Its First National Climate Data Portal",
      "link": "https://www.wri.org/update/milestone-data-driven-climate-action-ethiopia-launches-its-first-national-climate-data",
      "pubDate": "Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:34:57 EST",
      "description": "<p>Ethiopia has taken an important step toward stronger climate governance with the Climate Data Portal integrated into the National Digital Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation System. Led by the Ministry of Planning and Development (MoPD) with technical support from World Resources Institute, the portal brings climate-related data from key sector ministries, including the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Water and Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture, into one place, making it easier to update, verify and use.</p><p>Instead of relying on scattered spreadsheets and one-off reporting, sector ministries can now log into a single system to submit standardized climate indicators (for example, area reforested and/or afforested in million hectares; electric installed power capacity in megawatts; number of manufacturing industries transited from fossil fuel to clean energy; and area of land covered by green infrastructure and recreational areas in hectares). The portal is designed to support reporting and tracking for the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov.et/images/Polices/CRGE_Strategy_Final.pdf\">Climate-Resilient Green Economy</a> (CRGE) indicators and Nationally Determined Contributions (including <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/Ethiopia%20NDC%203.0%20Final.pdf\">NDC 3.0</a>) as well as to provide reliable data inputs for national modeling, including Ethiopia’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ethiopia-updated-ndc-climate-action\">Green Economy Model</a> (GEM).</p><h3>Centralizing Climate Data for Better Decisions</h3><p>Climate decisions are only as strong as the data behind them. Until now, climate data in Ethiopia has often been spread across institutions, reported in different formats and updated at irregular intervals. This made it more challenging to assess national progress clearly, compare performance across sectors and respond quickly when priorities changed. The Climate Data Portal helps solve this by creating a shared system that is owned by the government and built around routine reporting. For ministries, it reduces the time spent compiling and reconciling data while improving consistency through agreed indicator definitions and required metadata. For decision-makers, it offers a clearer view of progress and gaps. For partners and practitioners, it strengthens transparency and creates a more credible evidence base to support planning, finance discussions and program design.</p><h3>Key Achievements of the Climate Data Portal</h3><p>The Climate Data Portal was developed through a practical, step-by-step process. MoPD and WRI worked with Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) sector ministries to agree on priority indicators, align definitions and clarify where data will come from and who will be responsible for reporting.</p><p>The portal now includes:</p><ul><li>A secure, role-based interface for all CRGE sector ministries to submit climate indicators</li><li>Dashboards that display performance using charts and graphs</li><li>An indicator module to filter, view and download data by sector, year and theme (for example, land-use change and forestry, water resources, livestock, energy, waste, urbanization and sustainable cities, climate services and disaster risk reduction, transportation and mobility, and health)</li><li>A document library for climate strategies, policies and technical references</li><li>Integration with Ethiopia’s Digital Planning, Monitoring and Reporting System (DPMS), which aligns the portal with existing government workflows and supports data quality checks</li></ul><p>Together, these features turn climate data from static reports into something more useful: a living system that can be updated regularly and used to guide decisions.</p><h3><strong>The Strategic Importance of the Climate Data Portal</strong></h3><p>By providing more consistent and validated datasets, the Climate Data Portal strengthens the foundation for GEM-Ethiopia, supporting better calibration, scenario analysis and policy assessment. It also supports coordination across government by giving ministries a shared set of indicators and a common view of progress, which is especially important for CRGE and NDC implementation tracking.</p><h3>What’s Next?</h3><p>The next phase will focus on deepening the use and improving its functionality. Priorities include integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), expanding sectors and indicators, strengthening dashboard features and exploring future links to subnational reporting and climate finance tracking. Continued training and support for sector ministries will also be key to ensuring regular updates and strong institutional ownership.</p><p>To learn more about WRI’s ongoing work with Ethiopia’s Ministry of Planning and Development to strengthen national climate data, modeling systems and institutional capacity, visit <a href=\"https://www.wri.org\">www.wri.org</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in partnering with WRI to build on and expand this work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:sara.ascher@wri.org\">sara.ascher@wri.org</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Around the world, energy systems are undergoing rapid transformation. Rising demand, climate imperatives and technological innovation are converging to create a complex planning landscape. In response, the strategic approach known as Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) has emerged as a powerful framework that utilities and energy planners can use to balance supply and demand while finding cost-effective approaches to long-term electricity needs using renewable energy.</p><p>In many parts of the world, IRP and similar long-term planning processes (known by various names, such as Integrated Energy Planning or Integrated System Planning) are helping governments and utilities design resilient, cost-effective and equitable energy futures.</p><h3>What Is Integrated Resource Planning?</h3><p>Unlike traditional planning models that focus solely on power generation, IRP incorporates energy efficiency, demand response, storage and distributed energy resources. It also integrates broader goals such as equity, environmental protection, reliability and economic development.</p><p>The IRP process typically begins with setting clear objectives that reflect the priorities of a particular country, region or local jurisdiction — such as increasing renewable energy, reducing costs or improving energy access. Planners forecast future energy demand, evaluate resource options and use modeling tools to develop and compare scenarios. Once a preferred plan is selected, it is submitted for regulatory approval, implemented and periodically updated to reflect changing conditions.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p>This article is informed by research and insights from the<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/energy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" tabindex=\"0\" target=\"_blank\"> WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition</a>. The Center harnesses analytical power, convening ability and global expertise to help orchestrate a transition to a clean, abundant, affordable and reliable energy future by overcoming critical barriers.</p></div><p>Globally, IRP practices vary but share common principles. In the United States, for example, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/best_practices_irp_nov_2024_final_optimized.pdf\">more than 40 states</a> have formal IRP mandates that are typically updated every two to four years. In the European Union, member states submit 10-year National Energy and Climate Plans to meet EU-wide goals for decarbonization, energy efficiency and energy security. These plans are updated every two years and are supported by <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate/long-term-strategies/what-is-long-term-strategy\">long-term strategies</a> that the countries are required to develop for meeting their energy targets and emissions reduction goals under the Paris Agreement. In some developing countries, IRP and similar long-term planning processes are helping to manage rapid energy demand growth and the integration of evolving technologies, despite limited capital.</p><h3>Global Examples of Long-Term Planning Processes in Action</h3><p>Several developing countries have adopted IRP or similar frameworks to guide their energy transitions and have seen successful results:</p><ul><li><strong>Laos</strong> developed an Integrated Resource and Resilience Planning process in 2018 with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Stockholm Environment Institute. Using software modeling tools, the country developed scenarios for ensuring access to affordable and reliable power, identified renewable energy zones and developed a resilience action plan to address risks like flooding and extreme temperatures. After implementing the  process, Laos set a new record for clean energy investment, <a href=\"https://www.global-climatescope.org/markets/laos\">rising to $550 million in 2024</a>, a 5,320% increase from $10 million in 2023<strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Ghana</strong> launched its Integrated Power System Master Plan in 2018 and updated it in 2019 and 2023. Using the consulting firm ICF’s Integrated Planning Model, Ghana’s plan focuses on resilience, climate impacts and universal access. The plan includes a robust monitoring and evaluation framework and has helped expand energy access from 84% in 2018 to 90% by 2023, one of the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa.</li><li><strong>Jamaica</strong> approved a 20-year IRP in 2020 to meet its 50% renewable energy target by 2030. The plan includes solar, wind, liquified natural gas and other renewables, and is expected to mobilize over $7 billion in investment for infrastructure and energy efficiency. The country is ahead of this trajectory with <a href=\"https://jis.gov.jm/jamaica-making-progress-in-meeting-50-per-cent-renewable-energy-target/\">42% of electricity generation</a> coming from renewables.</li></ul><h4>Lessons from the US: How IRP Helped Drive Energy Stability</h4><p>In the U.S., IRP has evolved over four decades. Initially focused on reducing costs, IRP gained traction in the 1980s due to fuel price volatility and interest in energy efficiency. With the deregulation of the U.S. electricity market in the 1990s, regulators relied more on market competition to guide electricity system planning, and IRP rules in many states were loosened or repealed. But then came the California electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001: Generation capacity shortages, drought and delays in building new power plants resulted in blackouts, the collapse of a major energy company and an 800% increase in electricity prices. For the entire country, California’s crisis highlighted the importance of long-term energy planning, and regulators across the country began to renew and strengthen IRP mandates. Today, almost 80% of U.S. states require utilities to file an IRP or other long-term planning document.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26875505/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>IRP processes are tailored to the contexts of each state.  For example:</p><ul><li><strong>California</strong> uses a centralized IRP process led by the California Public Utilities Commission, aligned with greenhouse gas targets and involving utilities, stakeholders and transmission planners.</li><li><strong>Colorado</strong> requires Electric Resource Plans, and one utility in the state — Xcel Energy — uses all-source bidding to identify cost-effective projects.</li></ul><p>IRPs in the U.S. are shaped by each state’s clean energy mandates, such as Renewable Portfolio Standards, clean energy standards and energy storage requirements. More than 30 states have these types of goals, with many targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040–2050. Many utilities also set their own goals that exceed state mandates — more than 50 utilities have committed to net-zero or 100% clean energy targets.</p><p>These goals and requirements create a complex web of demands and expectations for utility compliance. But using the IRP process has enabled U.S. utilities to chart paths to simultaneously meet all of these goals and requirements: <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-023-03645-7\">A study carried out by the University of Colorado</a> found that utilities are generally on track to meet or exceed their state mandates and their own goals, and projects that the U.S. electric grid will be 100% decarbonized by 2060 if all goals are met.</p><p>But to achieve such ambitious goals, IRP approaches and modeling need to continue to evolve to tackle new challenges that surround the clean energy transition. Emerging challenges for planners involved in the IRP process include modeling energy storage, reflecting changing renewable costs, estimating natural gas prices, incorporating policy incentives and planning for new technologies like offshore wind and hydrogen. Water availability and climate change impacts are also increasingly critical issues, prompting the use of frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.deepuncertainty.org/\">Decision-Making Under Deep Uncertainty</a>, which helps utilities prepare for multiple possible futures.</p><div class=\"callout city-callout\"><p class=\"city-callout-heading\"><strong>Case Study: How IRP Can Help India Balance Demand Growth with Decarbonization </strong> </p><p>While every country has its own unique set of energy planning challenges and solutions, India presents an interesting case study of a growing economy looking to add more renewable energy in a way that’s efficient, sustainable and affordable.</p><p>Electricity demand is soaring in India, which is nearing 1.5 billion people with an expanding economy. At the same time, the country has made strong climate commitments — <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1885731\">cutting emissions intensity by 45% and reaching 50% non-fossil capacity</a> — which it <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2144627\"> achieved</a> five years ahead of schedule in July 2025. </p><p>Meanwhile, the coal sector continues to play a significant role in India’s energy mix, contributing over <a href=\"https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/executive/2025/04/Executive_Summary_March_2025_Aztual.pdf\">70% of the total electricity generated as of March 2025.</a> With falling prices of solar and battery storage systems and a more flexible power purchasing landscape for consumers, the share of renewable energy in the grid is expected to rise. However, this increase will require technical and economic solutions to manage variability, intermittency and resulting grid integration costs.</p><p>IRP can help states in India strike a balance of reliability and affordability while meeting the requirements of the Central Electricity Authority’s resource adequacy framework and state-specific regulations. While state utilities are free to make independent assumptions and projections, they need to ensure that their plans to add capacity are in sync with their share of the national targets. Otherwise, they risk facing stiff penalties. Although different states face diverse energy realities, they share a common need for more accurate demand estimation and a robust planning approach that ensures reliable and affordable power supply and prevents future deficits and/or stranded assets.</p><p>Done rightly using open-source modelling tools, an IRP process can allow regulators and policymakers in India to transparently and objectively evaluate the costs and outcomes of various energy scenarios with different supply mixes and demand projections, along with the grid resources required for meeting the projected demand. These decisions can help inform specific policy and regulatory goals that can support a more sustainable, affordable and/or reliable energy future.</p></div><h3>A Strategy for Cost-Effective Clean Energy Planning</h3><p>IRP offers a strategic pathway to accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring reliability, affordability and equity. IRP and other long-term planning processes can help align national climate goals with local development needs, optimize resource use, and build resilient energy systems.</p><p>As global energy systems evolve, IRP offers a proven, adaptable framework that can help countries design resilient, inclusive and low-carbon electricity systems that meet both present needs and future ambitions.</p>",

When we first built houses up here, people weren’t thinking about that and some even had wooden shingle roofs. But gradually, people started to change how they build and maintain their land.” </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres, speaks in front of an aspen grove on his property.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/jim-w-in-alpine-acres.JPG?VersionId=.jc9tKvMQAo42qxHekBWrLkxvj5L_cwf&itok=MWSTWL7I\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres, speaks in front of an aspen grove on his property.

Crucially, this sort of work can happen faster and on a greater scale than before thanks to a new funding model, the Utah Resilience Fund (URF). Invented and deployed by a coalition of partners including Summit County, World Resources Institute, the U.S. Forest Service and others, the fund is reshaping how Utah manages wildfire risk and water security.</p><h3>A Fund to Address Catastrophic Wildfire Risk at Scale </h3><p>For decades, wildfire funding in the U.S. has typically been reactive, mobilizing resources only after fires ignite. In Utah alone, fire suppression <a href=\"https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2024/08/23/utah-spend-almost-12-million-fighting-wildfires/\">topped $28 million in 2024</a> with the state shouldering about a quarter of that cost. Yet states could actually <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800924001411\">save money in the long run</a> by investing upfront in forest restoration. This investment can avoid the devastating economic and human toll of catastrophic fires while also creating more jobs, recreation and water security.  </p><p>That’s where the Utah Resilience Fund comes in. Founded in 2020, it brings together public, private and philanthropic partners to take proactive steps, before disaster strikes. So far, the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/story/utah-resilience-fund/\">URF has raised more than $8.4 million</a> for faster, more flexible funding for restoration on both public and private lands, ensuring forest and watershed health treatments complement each other across boundaries. Beyond meeting urgent short-term needs, it also sets some funds aside in an <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0131.html\">income-generating endowment</a> to help sustain this work over the long term.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"823\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"658\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"504\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"397\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"238\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The Utah Resilience Fund Model\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/the-utah-resilience-fund-model.png?VersionId=PXl.JBcyL3H5DitG4.DrHqjHexvVBAX6&itok=DgsAEKAf\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>“The way we look at it now is to get ahead of the potential wildfire that we know is coming,” said Dano Jauregui, district ranger for the Heber-Kamas Ranger District of the U.S. Forest Service. “It costs far less to prepare the landscape upfront than to try to control or suppress a large fire later.” </p><h3>From the Weber Headwaters to the Great Salt Lake </h3><p>Improved wildfire resilience does not just protect homes from flames. It also safeguards Utah’s most precious resource — water. Catastrophic wildfire can send ash, sediment and chemical contaminants into the reservoirs, reducing storage capacity and threatening drinking water supplies. Overly dense and fire-prone forests can also draw down groundwater levels, leading to reduced water availability. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The upper Weber River flows through the community of Alpine Acres.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/upper-weber-river.JPG?VersionId=HvozpJTn31nLggpV8qH9iLtyzRpLaKxV&h=b39c5fef&itok=J22AH7Nl\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The upper Weber River flows through the community of Alpine Acres.

Decades of <a href=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/\">fire suppression</a> (putting out fires immediately), combined with <a href=\"https://naturalresources.utah.gov/dnr-newsfeed/drought-in-utah-more-than-a-water-supply-issue/\">higher temperatures and prolonged drought</a>, have disrupted this natural cycle. Forests are now overgrown with dense vegetation and dead trees, creating fuel for high-intensity wildfire. These types of wildfires <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2006/11/23/hayman-fire-still-mucking-up-water/\">scorch and damage soil</a>, send sediment downstream and ultimately degrade water quality.</p><p>To restore balance, land managers use forest thinning (selectively removing smaller and unhealthy trees), prescribed burns (carefully applying fire to a landscape), and other techniques to reduce accumulated fuel, lower wildfire risk and protect the watersheds that provide clean water downstream. Innovative financial mechanisms such as the Utah Resilience Fund and the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/project/forest-resilience-bond/\">Forest Resilience Bond</a> help to pay for this work upfront, enabling faster, larger-scale restoration.   </p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-Utah-Forest-Management.pdf\">Forest Management FAQ</a> and <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-Utah-Resilience-Fund.pdf\">URF FAQ</a>.</p></div><p>This is especially true in Utah, <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8476/\">the second driest state in the country</a>, where many forested headwaters lie in high wildfire risk zones. A core area where the URF is accelerating wildfire risk reduction is across the Weber River watershed.

Over the next decade, the USFS plans to treat 14,000 acres in the upper Weber watershed. This work will include creating a network of fuel breaks and thinning projects to reduce fire intensity and improve ecological health.</p><p>But treating federal lands alone isn’t enough. Fire doesn’t respect administrative boundaries, and real wildfire risk reduction requires cross boundary treatments that include restoring the surrounding private lands. The URF helps make this possible through funding adjacent fuel reduction projects in communities such as Alpine Acres, and further downstream, the <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4adda37668974b6b8eae31e90707ecfb\">910 Ranch</a>.  </p><p>Once a working sheep ranch established in the late 1800s, this 8,500-acre property straddles the source of East Canyon Creek, a key tributary of the Weber River, and is one of the last contiguous mountain ranches in the Park City area. Through the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/private-land/forest-legacy\">Forest Legacy Program</a>, a federal grant program to protect lands from development, Summit County and partners recently <a href=\"https://www.parkrecord.com/2026/01/27/summit-county-has-officially-closed-on-the-910-cattle-ranch/\">secured the land’s permanent protection</a>.

In forested areas, crews have thinned dense conifer stands across 73 acres to reduce fuel loads and create a mosaic of openings that function as natural fire breaks. All these piles of conifers will be burned this winter, and debris along road corridors has already been chipped to improve safe access for emergency personnel.   </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Stacked piles of trees and brush\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/stacked-piles-of-trees-and-brush.JPG?VersionId=LztTDJGpJTNcM1PLPWnmDlwNLEn8nTLo&itok=Au--1NVY\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Stacked piles of trees and brush that have been thinned during a fuel reduction project on 910 Ranch to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health.

In the valley of the 910 Ranch, additional work is restoring the riverbanks to improve fish habitat and downstream water quality.  </p><p>“We’ve started replanting vegetation along East Canyon Creek, building cattle exclusion fences and putting in beaver dam analogs to restore the natural water flow and rebuild the streambanks,” said Kirby.  </p><p>Partners such as Trout Unlimited and local volunteers, with funding from Summit County and the Caterpillar Foundation, have planted <a href=\"https://ut-summitcounty.civicplus.com/2507/Outreach-Engagement\">over 700 willows</a> and dozens of cottonwood trees. This has helped stabilize eroding banks and provide shade for stretches of East Canyon Creek that had been grazed for more than a century. The team is also testing the reintroduction of <a href=\"https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/why-beaver-dam-analogs-work-low-tech-process-based-restoration-explained\">beaver-inspired habitat systems</a> to hold more water in the soil and extend flows through dry summer months.</p><p>For Kirby, the project is deeply personal. Having lost her home in Colorado’s 2001 Hayman Fire, she views the 910 Ranch as a generational investment in stewardship.</p><p>“This ranch is a legacy piece,” she said. “With the help of partnerships, this is going to be the biggest thing I’ll do in my career. It connects nearly 55,000 acres of protected land from Park City into Morgan County. When my grandkids come here someday, they’re going to say, ‘Look what Grandma helped do.’” </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jae-H_I0B_w\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch Utah Pioneers a New Model for Wildfire Resilience\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Video: \"Utah Pioneers a New Model for Wildfire Resilience\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>The Path Forward: Building a Model for the West</h3><p>The URF shows that proactive investment in wildfire resilience can protect forests and communities upstream, while benefiting those downstream.

      "description": "<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have emitted <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co-emissions?country=~OWID_WRL\">more than</a> <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co2-land-use?tab=line\">2,000 gigatonnes</a> of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. (A gigatonne is one billion metric tons.)</p><p>This concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the air causes the climate change impacts we’re experiencing today, from forest fires to stifling heat waves and damaging sea level rise — and the global community is still emitting more each year. Unless we make serious changes, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/2023-ipcc-ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-findings\">climate impacts will only continue to intensify.</a></p><p>The imperative for combating climate change is to curb emissions rapidly — for example, by ramping up renewable energy, boosting energy efficiency, halting deforestation and curbing super pollutants like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf\">latest assessment of climate science</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tells us, however, that these efforts alone aren’t enough.</p><p>To keep global temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), which scientists say is necessary for preventing the worst impacts of climate change, we’ll need to not only reduce emissions but also <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2018/03/taking-greenhouse-gases-sky-7-things-know-about-carbon-removal\">remove and store some carbon that’s already in the atmosphere</a>.</p><h3>What Is Carbon Dioxide Removal?</h3><p>Carbon dioxide removal (or simply “carbon removal”) aims to help mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide pollution directly from the atmosphere. Carbon removal strategies include familiar approaches like growing trees as well as more novel technologies <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\">like direct air capture</a>, which scrubs CO2 from the air after which it can be sequestered underground.</p><p>Carbon removal is different from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/carbon-capture-technology\">carbon capture and storage (CCS)</a>, which captures emissions at the source — like from a power plant or a cement producer — and prevents those emissions from entering the atmosphere in the first place. Carbon capture is a form of emissions reduction rather than carbon removal.</p><h3>How Important Is Carbon Removal in the Fight Against Climate Change?</h3><p><strong>The latest </strong><a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/\"><strong>climate model scenarios</strong></a><strong> show that in addition to substantial and rapid emissions reductions, large-scale carbon removal will be needed to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C.</strong> The amount of carbon removal ultimately needed will depend on how quickly we reduce emissions in the near term as well as the magnitude and duration of any increase above 1.5 degrees C, known as overshoot. Estimates, including both natural and technological carbon removal approaches, range from <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/633458017a1ae214f3772c76/t/669e6c162eb5af1a357c5ef4/1721658412072/The-State-of-Carbon-Dioxide-Removal-2Edition-3.pdf\">7 billion to 9 billion</a> metric tons per year globally by 2050. For context, the United States emitted just over <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2023&regions=USA&source=PIK&start_year=1850\">6 billion metric tons </a>of greenhouse gases in 2023. The faster the world reduces its emissions in the near term, the less it will have to rely on carbon removal. Conversely, as global emissions continue to rise, more carbon removal would be needed to meet global climate goals.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1160\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"888\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"700\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"419\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A chart that shows how limiting global warming requires reaching net-zero emissions\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/limiting-global-warming-requires-reaching-net-zero-emissions.png?VersionId=vfe71DFh60ujkznP1MjcCfrhoPNeOl_Z&itok=D0qaEBc4\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>While enhancing natural carbon removal through reforestation and forest management has long been of interest, efforts to develop and deploy novel technologies and approaches have ramped up more recently. In less than a decade, carbon removal has grown from a niche concept to a <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/lts-explore?category=ghg_target&indicator=lts_crbn_rmvl\">well-accepted component of climate portfolios</a> and has received <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/carbon-removal-BIL-IRA\">billions of dollars of government funding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/2026-investment-landscape-in-carbon-removal\">private investment</a>.</p><p>This expansion was largely spurred by a <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\">2018 report from the IPCC</a> which concluded that <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\">hundreds of billions of tons of carbon removal will be needed</a> by the end of the century to meet global climate goals. More recent <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/\">IPCC reports</a> from 2022 have reaffirmed this finding. The level of carbon removed today <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-action-progress-1-5-degrees-c-2025\">remains far below</a> what we expect to need in the coming decades, indicating a need for investment in the public and private sectors to continue growing.</p><p>As investment and deployment increases, it is important to make sure carbon removal is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/responsible-carbon-dioxide-removal\">deployed responsibly</a>. This includes making sure it complements, rather than replaces, emissions reduction, minimizes negative impacts on people and ideally provides benefits, and uses resources sustainably, among other factors.</p><h3>How Is CO2 Removed from the Atmosphere?</h3><p>Carbon removal can take numerous forms, from new technologies to land management practices. The big question is whether these approaches can deliver carbon removal at the pace and scale needed in the coming decades.</p><p>Each carbon removal approach involves tradeoffs, including varying costs, resource needs (such as energy, land and water usage), benefits or negative impacts to people or the environment, and technology readiness, among others. Understanding the extent of these tradeoffs in different circumstances and investing in a portfolio of carbon removal approaches will be key to balancing them.</p><p>Here are six options for removing carbon from the atmosphere:</p><h3>1) Trees and Forests</h3><p>Plants remove carbon dioxide from the air naturally, and trees are especially good at storing CO2 removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Expanding, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/global-restoration-initiative\">restoring</a> and managing tree cover to encourage more carbon uptake can leverage the power of photosynthesis, converting carbon dioxide in the air into carbon stored in wood and soils.</p><p>Some management approaches that can increase carbon removal by trees and forests include:</p><ul><li>Reforestation, or restoring forest ecosystems after they’ve been damaged by wildfire or cleared for agricultural or commercial uses.</li><li>Restocking, or increasing the density of forests where trees have been lost due to disease or disturbances.</li><li>Silvopasture, or incorporating trees into animal agriculture systems.</li><li>Cropland agroforestry, or incorporating trees into row crop agriculture systems.</li><li>Urban reforestation, or increasing tree cover in urban areas.</li></ul><p>Earlier WRI research estimates that the theoretical carbon removal potential from forests and trees outside forests in the United States alone is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/02/how-where-plant-trees-us\">more than half a gigatonne per year</a> as of 2020, equivalent to all annual emissions from the U.S. agricultural sector. What’s more, approaches to remove CO2 through forests can be relatively inexpensive compared to other carbon removal options (generally <a href=\"https://www.un-redd.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Forest%20carbon%20pricing%20brief%20-%20FINAL.pdf\">less than $50</a> per metric ton of CO2) and yield cleaner water and air in the process.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Infographic showing five tree-based approaches for carbon removal such as planting and restoring trees in forests and cities.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2023-03/tree-restoration-carbon-removal-wri.png?VersionId=6SEIMTx3wQNBwo7YWr24Mcil6k5V7QYV&itok=GOgQcJnP\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>One major challenge is ensuring that forest expansion in one area doesn’t come at the expense of forests somewhere else. For example, taking farmland out of production would reduce the supply of food. This could necessitate converting other forests to farmland — resulting in more greenhouse gas emissions — unless improvements in farm productivity could fill the gap. Similarly, not harvesting timber from one forest may result in overharvesting in another. These dynamics make restoring and managing existing forests, and adding trees to ecologically appropriate lands outside of farmland, especially important.</p><h3>2) Biomass Carbon Removal and Storage</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.icef.go.jp/pdf/summary/roadmap/icef2020_roadmap.pdf\">Biomass carbon removal and storage</a> (BiCRS) includes a range of processes that use biomass from plants or algae to remove carbon dioxide from the air and then store it for long periods of time. These methods aim to leverage the carbon storage capacity of plants beyond their natural lifecycles: Whereas trees remove and store carbon only until they die and decompose, biomass carbon removal and storage aims to sequester the CO2 that plants capture more permanently.</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/biomass-carbon-removal-storage-companies-fight-climate-change\">many different methods</a> for removing carbon using biomass. These include the creation of biochar, which is made by heating biomass in low-oxygen environments to produce a charcoal-like soil additive that sequesters carbon; bio-oil, which uses a similar process to produce a liquid that gets injected underground; and permanent storage of carbon-rich biomass in vaults. Bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is another carbon removal pathway which involves generating energy using biomass and then capturing and sequestering the resulting CO2 emissions. One type of BECCS that features prominently in many <a href=\"https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/?explorer=year&state=national&table=2020&limit=200\">economy-wide decarbonization scenarios</a> is converting biomass to hydrogen, which could result in a carbon-negative fuel.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\"></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>While biomass carbon removal and storage can offer long-term CO2 removal, not all processes necessarily provide a net carbon benefit.</p><p>For example, if crops are grown specifically to be used for biomass carbon removal, they <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/avoiding-bioenergy-competition-food-crops-and-land\">could displace food production</a> or natural ecosystems. This can cause cropland expansion and destruction of forests and grasslands, both of which release carbon and can erase the climate benefits of BiCRS while also exacerbating food insecurity and ecosystem loss.</p><p>On the other hand, if BiCRS processes use <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/sustainable-biomass-carbon-removal\">biomass sources</a> that don’t compete with food crops or ecosystems for land — such as algae or waste materials — they can provide net carbon removal. For example, many forestry and agricultural wastes, such as tree bark, nut hulls, and corn husks and stalks, are burned or left to decompose; using those materials instead for biomass carbon removal and storage can be beneficial from a climate perspective. Globally, the supply of biomass waste is likely lower than the potential demand to use it, especially as different sectors look to replace fossil fuels. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/biomass-and-land-use-decarbonizing-us-economy\">WRI research</a> shows that carbon removal may be a particularly valuable use of waste and residue biomass, rather than, say, electricity production, which can be more efficiently produced with renewable energy technologies like wind and solar.</p><p>To fully harness the carbon removal potential of BiCRS pathways, policy and market incentives are needed to encourage the use of waste biomass and disincentivize the use of purpose-grown crops that could undermine the natural ability of forests and soils to sequester carbon.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1100\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"880\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"674\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"531\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"318\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A chart showing the principles for sustainable sourcing of biomass\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/12-12-07-biomass-explainer-sustainable-principles.png?VersionId=0tTskWmKPlMcLddYDwPJnc1Qj7nciNLh&itok=UyR0Uyfa\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>3) Direct Air Capture</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\">Direct air capture</a> is the process of chemically scrubbing carbon dioxide from the ambient air and then sequestering it either underground or in long-lived products like concrete. This technology is similar to the carbon capture and storage technology used to reduce emissions from sources like power plants and industrial facilities. The difference is that direct air capture removes excess carbon that’s already been emitted into the atmosphere, instead of capturing it at the source.</p><article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1100\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"880\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"674\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"531\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"318\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Visualization of the direct air capture process that shows machinery scrubbing carbon dioxide from the air and storing it, for example underground or in products like concrete.\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2023-03/direct-air-capture-carbon-removal-wri.png?VersionId=Dq6SrT9SP8m_oItuydvjv8lZyfEeiAic&itok=Csms0RMV\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>It is relatively straightforward to measure and account for the climate benefits of direct air capture, and its potential scale of deployment is enormous. However, the technology remains costly and energy-intensive today.</p><p>Cost estimates for DAC with sequestration vary: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BH_B_Df_7e2l6AH8_8a0aK70nlAJXfCTwfyCgxkL5C8/edit#gid=164845246\">voluntary purchases of carbon removal credits</a> from direct air capture range from $100 to more than $2,000 per metric ton of CO2 depending on the technology, energy source, use of policy incentives, and other factors. The average cost is expected to come down as projects are built and technologies improve.</p><p>Direct air capture also requires substantial heat and power inputs: Scrubbing 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide from the air could require around 7% of current U.S. energy consumption (assuming each metric ton <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2025/ee/d4ee04058a\">requires 2,000 kWh</a>). To maximize net carbon removal, therefore, direct air capture technology needs to be powered by low- or zero-carbon energy sources.</p><p>Investing in technological development and deployment experience, together with increasing availability of cheap, clean energy could advance prospects for direct air capture at a large scale.</p><p>Direct air capture has seen a significant public and private investment in recent years, helping spur the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UobgHejUQe8PhMZoV4RLGC0q406M-lIrlRSJAghh8ys/edit?gid=0\">more than 150 companies</a> around the world as of early 2026. In the U.S., research and demonstration funding for DAC and other carbon removal approaches has grown significantly since 2019, though recent political changes have frozen or stalled grants for DAC provided in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. However, the <a href=\"https://carboncapturecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/45Q-primer-Carbon-Capture-Coalition.pdf\">45Q tax credit</a> that supports DAC was further expanded in the July 2025 reconciliation budget bill. The private sector is also supporting DAC development through <a href=\"https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards\">individual</a> and <a href=\"https://frontierclimate.com/\">collective</a> purchasing commitments for CDR, including DAC, which help spurs development by creating guaranteed demand.</p><p>Interest in DAC is growing outside the U.S. as well, with projects in operation on five continents. Countries including Kenya, the UK, and Japan have DAC pilots and demonstration projects underway, and the <a href=\"https://climeworks.com/plant-mammoth\">largest operational DAC</a> plant as of January 2026 is in Iceland. As projects move from the lab to demonstration, they are providing the experience and testing to optimize DAC technologies based on real-world conditions.</p>\n\n      \n\n    \n    \n<div class=\"embedded-entity embed--block-type--in-this-series has-border-background-color\">\n      <h3 class=\"embed-block__title\">Related</h3>\n  \n  \n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-featured-items field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate\" hreflang=\"en\">Climate</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/biomass-carbon-removal-storage-companies-fight-climate-change\" hreflang=\"en\">Companies Are Finding New Ways to Use Waste and Fight Climate Change</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            January 14, 2026\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"A man directs heavy equipment as part of Charm Industrial's bio-oil production.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2026-01/charm-bio-oil-bicrs.jpg?VersionId=zdWx.i0wTp3aj7dXCQCQsbAAGGnqoZto&h=0f4230fa&itok=OTveWinE\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate\" hreflang=\"en\">Climate</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\" hreflang=\"en\">6 Things to Know About Direct Air Capture</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            September 2, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Climeworks founder C.Gebald & J.Wurzbacher in front of Climeworks plant \" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2022-05/Climeworks%20founder%20C.Gebald%20%26%20J.Wurzbacher%20in%20front%20of%20Climeworks%20plant_Wide%20Angle_PhotosbyJuliaDunlop.jpg?VersionId=QaqZL8qxFx5yhoE5jMFtcgfmxrd4Lq3W&h=9eb0d413&itok=n6suBXAu\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate\" hreflang=\"en\">Climate</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-carbon-dioxide-removal-us\" hreflang=\"en\">Ocean Carbon Removal Is Uncharted Territory.

This process is commonly referred to as “<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/carbon-mineralization-carbon-removal\">carbon mineralization</a>” or “enhanced weathering,” and it naturally happens very slowly, over hundreds or thousands of years.</p><p>But scientists are figuring out how to speed up the carbon mineralization process, especially by enhancing the exposure of these minerals to CO2 in the air or ocean. That could mean moving air through large deposits of mine tailings (rocks left over from mining operations) that contain the right mineral composition; crushing certain rocks or developing enzymes that chew up mineral deposits to increase their surface area; spreading certain types of ground rock on croplands or coastal areas where it reacts with and locks away carbon dioxide; and finding ways for certain industrial byproducts, like fly ash, kiln dust or iron and steel slag, that are reactive with CO2 to sequester it.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1675\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1340\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1026\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"808\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"484\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Types of carbon mineralization approaches\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/types-of-carbon-mineralization-approaches.png?VersionId=8MCYeB5baQ7kFbzRkErb6zLyNUAKEUnW&itok=jnkurwSb\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Carbon mineralization can also be used to sequester carbon dioxide that’s already been captured by injecting that CO2 into suitable rock types where it reacts to form a solid carbonate, permanently storing it. Other applications could sequester carbon and replace more emissions-intensive conventional production methods — for example, by using mineralization as part of concrete production, which is used at a multi-billion-ton scale globally.</p><p>Scientists have shown that carbon mineralization is possible and a handful of start-ups are already developing approaches, including mineralization-based building materials. However, there is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/carbon-mineralization-policies-incentives\">more work to be done</a> to map out cost-effective and prudent applications for scaled deployment and improve measurement of carbon sequestration.</p><h3>5) Marine Carbon Removal Approaches</h3><p>A number of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/leveraging-oceans-carbon-removal-potential\">marine carbon removal approaches</a> have been proposed to leverage the ocean’s capacity to sequester carbon and expand the portfolio of options beyond land-based applications. However, these approaches are at early stages of development and require more research and field testing to understand whether they are effective at removing carbon and what impacts they have on people and the environment. Expanding this knowledge base, combined with clarifying and improving governance (both in national and international waters) are critical to understanding which approaches are appropriate for investment.</p><p>Each marine carbon removal approach aims to accelerate natural carbon cycles in the ocean. Potential approaches can be biotic and include leveraging photosynthesis in coastal plants, seaweed, or phytoplankton; or abiotic, such as adding certain minerals to seawater that react with dissolved CO2 and lock it away; or running an electric current through seawater to accelerate reactions that ultimately help extract CO2.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"885\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"708\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"542\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"427\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"General types of ocean CDR approaches\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/general-types-of-ocean-cdr-approaches.png?VersionId=8e5x565y01Yw3BSRW8_xya2N3WW2c5Rr&itok=ndYV-4FS\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Some marine carbon removal options could also provide co-benefits. For example, coastal blue carbon (carbon stored in mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes) and seaweed cultivation could remove carbon while also supporting ecosystem restoration, and adding minerals to help the ocean sequester carbon could reduce ocean acidification locally. However, much is still unknown about the broader ecological impacts of these approaches and further research is needed to better understand potential risks before these approaches are pursued at any scale.</p><h3>6) Farms and Soils</h3><p>Soils naturally sequester carbon, but agricultural soils are running a big deficit due to frequent plowing and erosion from farming and grazing, all of which release stored carbon. Because agricultural land is so expansive — encompassing more than <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/statistics/highlights-archive/highlights-detail/land-statistics-2001-2023.-global--regional-and-country-trends/en\">4,800 million hectares</a> around the world, or more than one-third of global land area — even small increases in soil carbon per acre <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/publication/land-carbon-removal-usa\">could be impactful.</a></p><p>There are many practices that can increase the amount of carbon stored in soils, although the amount and duration of the carbon sequestered depend on regional climate and soil type, among other factors.</p><p>Planting cover crops when fields are otherwise bare can extend photosynthesis throughout the year; using compost can improve yields while storing the compost’s carbon content in the soil; and scientists are developing crops with deeper roots, making them more resistant to drought while depositing additional carbon into the soil. Many of the practices that increase soil carbon also improve soil health and can make agricultural systems more resilient to climate change.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Increasing soil carbon can benefit farmers and ranchers in addition to removing carbon from the atmosphere.

Photo by James Baltz/Unsplash</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Managing soil for carbon at a large scale, though, is a tricky proposition. Natural systems are inherently variable, and that makes it a real challenge to predict, measure and monitor the long-term carbon benefits of any given practice on a given acre. <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b9362d89d5abb8c51d474f8/t/62292045a84bb233211775e7/1646862413364/Carbon180-SoilCarbonMoonshot.pdf\">More research</a> is needed to understand how these practices affect carbon sequestration in different soil types and different climates, and how long the carbon remains stored.</p><p>The efficacy of some soil carbon sequestration practices — such as cover crops and grazing management — is also subject to <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/can-farmers-fight-climate-change-new-u-s-law-gives-them-billions-try\">continued scientific debate</a>. Furthermore, changing conditions or management practices from year to year could erase prior gains. And because climate-smart farming practices would need to be adopted over large tracts of farmland to remove a significant amount of carbon, governments and market systems would need to incentivize landowners to implement these measures.</p><h3>The Future of Carbon Removal</h3><div class=\"report-teaser gold-borders-medium alignright\"><div class=\"text-wrapper\"><div class=\"h4 topic-tag\">RELATED RESOURCE</div><p><strong>Technological Carbon Removal</strong><br />Systems Change Lab</p><p><a class=\"button small\" href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/technological-carbon-removal\">Learn more</a></p></div></div><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/carbonshot-federal-policy-options-carbon-removal-united-states\">Analysis by WRI</a> has shown that the most cost-effective and lowest-risk strategy for increasing carbon removal capacity involves developing and deploying a variety of approaches in tandem.</p><p>Moving forward, diverse methods of carbon dioxide removal must be <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/residual-emissions-carbon-removal\">built into climate change strategies</a> around the world to avoid dangerous levels of global warming.

Over <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/media/348941\">398,000 people</a> worked in the EV sector in 2024, spanning battery-electric vehicles, hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.</p><p>While the workforce is expanding, there will also be changes to existing jobs. Because EVs require fewer parts and less maintenance compared to gas-powered vehicles, maintenance worker, mechanic and technician jobs could be at risk. Protecting current auto workers will require <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/reskilling-workforce-training-needs-electric-school-bus-operators-and-maintenance-technicians\">intentional efforts</a> to include them in the EV transition, including training, reskilling and an inclusive talent pipeline.</p><p>At the same time that these shifts are happening, the U.S. is dealing with an aging auto technician population. The average age in the industry is <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/auto-mechanic-jobs/demographics/\">40 years old,</a> and many workers are nearing retirement. It’s estimated that the country will need to add <a href=\"http://techforce.org/news-release-2024-technician-supply-demand-report/#:~:text=Report%20Warns%20of%20Critical%20Need,force%20growth%20rate%20of%202.0%25.\">1 million</a> entry-level technicians in the next five years. The demand for new workers, particularly young people, to fill technician roles will remain high in the foreseeable future.</p><p>With equitable investments in workforce development, the U.S. has a chance to usher new workers into good-paying, reliable jobs that will also help advance clean transportation. But it won’t happen on its own, and training needs to be at the forefront.</p><p>EV training in schools is still relatively nascent. There are <a href=\"https://www.aseeducationfoundation.org/\">1,800 schools</a>, serving 118,000 students, accredited by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), a non-profit organization focused on improving the quality of vehicle repair and service by testing and certifying automotive professionals. While ASE specifically offers certifications for high-voltage vehicle electrical safety, implementation across schools and training programs is low: WRI counted just <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/electric-school-bus-technician-training-database\">118 EV technician training programs</a> across the U.S. in colleges and private institutions as of November 2025, comprising a small number of existing automotive training programs.</p><p>Still, these early movers offer important examples. From the mountains of North Carolina to the bustling streets of the Bronx, New York, we looked at two innovative programs that are helping young people from historically disadvantaged communities prepare for new opportunities in the auto sector.</p><h3>Building EV Skills in Cherokee, North Carolina</h3><p>Cliff Cochran has worked as a mechanic in Cherokee, North Carolina for more than four decades, meaning he’s been through more than one new wave of technology. Today, Cliff is employed as a technician and automotive trainer with Cherokee Boys Club. The organization has been a driving force for electrification in its community, deploying 16 electric school buses (so far), one electric semi-truck, a large solar array and vehicle-to-grid charging technology. It has a microgrid in development, which will provide energy to CBC.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-right half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1013\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"800\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"An instructor and student working on a solar-powered golf cart in an automotive garage. \" height=\"607\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/electric-golf-cart-cherokee-boys-club_0.jpg?VersionId=xMIw6WJZqdXnT1yv3lHX7YFTFw95iqbO&itok=MbDP8Lnz\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Instructor Cliff Cochran and a high school intern working in the Cherokee Boys Club garage. Photo by Katie Tiger</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>While the technology has changed, Cliff’s perspective is that electric vehicles share many similarities to diesel, and he enjoys training young workers on them. Cliff helps Cherokee Central High School student interns get hands-on experience with EVs and a garage setting.</p><p>This past summer, Cliff and his student interns were working to convert golf carts, donated by <a href=\"https://www.usagolfcartservice.com/\">USA Golf Carts</a>, to solar and battery-powered electric vehicles. Students learned about basic EV safety, vehicle maintenance and the use of personal protective equipment — all without the risk of high voltage systems that heavier-duty EVs employ. Cliff offered instruction on how to wire a lithium-ion battery to the golf cart powertrain, connect solar panels to the entire system, and continuously use a multimeter (a handheld tool that measures electrical properties like voltage) during the process.</p><p>By the end of the project, students were riding two functional electric golf carts around the parking lot, completely powered by the solar panels fixed to their roofs.</p><p>This type of training not only generates interest among young learners, but can be easily and safely replicated to train other mechanics on how EVs are built and function. While passenger electric vehicles aren’t solar powered, many of the fundamental electrical skills are the same. As Donnie Owle, CBC Service Manager, puts it: “It's a good, basic way to show something where the voltage is not that high.” He adds that it’s a lot more fun for the students (and adults), too.</p><p>Still, getting young people interested in these internships is a key challenge for CBC, which has seen applications decline steeply in recent years. Where its various programs once received 50 to 60 applications per year, in recent years, they might only have five. Owle sees electrification as an opportunity to engage young people in more exciting aspects of mechanic work, like using advanced, real-time vehicle data to track the locations and battery charge on CBC’s electric buses and trucks.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Electric school buses charging under a solar canopy.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/electric-school-buses-solar-charging-cherokee-boys-club_0.jpg?VersionId=tGqpDY35ELsQkiEvYhdaW5ntlVjYQn0E&itok=mRFT497h\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Alongside solar-powered golf carts, Cherokee Boys Club boasts an electric school bus fleet and solar charging canopy.

Originally focused on diesel and gasoline systems, it later expanded to include early-stage hybrids like the Toyota Prius. A collaboration with Toyota helped inform curriculum development around hybrid systems in 2000. BCC also formed a partnership with Nissan in September 2018 to create a training academy that prepares graduating auto technicians for factory or dealership work, including on early-stage hybrid and electric vehicles.</p><p>Clement Drummond is the Director of Automotive Technology at BCC. When the program first began receiving hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles, he formed a 25-member advisory board comprising experts from dealerships, car manufacturers and EV makers to advise on course development. He later implemented a comprehensive set of safety and training protocols to address the unique risks of working on high-voltage systems, like electrical shocks.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-left half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1014\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"801\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"An instructor with a training equipment for electric vehicles. \" height=\"607\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-01/bronx-community-college-ev-training-vertical_0.jpg?VersionId=9OnvWm5JYqiiJR1PPn22IN.wWFJ8hB7j&itok=2_XvqFXY\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Clement Drummond, Director of Automotive Technology at Bronx Community College, showing a training platform for automotive students in the Patterson Garage.

These protocols not only protect students and staff, but also prepare graduates for the workforce, where these skills are transferable across a wide variety of battery-powered vehicles.</p><p>As the automotive sector continues to transform alongside evolving technology, Director Drummond is focused on future-ready training. In February 2023, BCC completed a garage facility transformation with state-of-the-art training materials, such as vehicle lifts and specialized tools to work on EVs. In October 2025, the college announced a <a href=\"https://www.bcc.cuny.edu/bcc-partners-with-waymo-to-develop-enhanced-autonomous-vehicle-training-program-at-state-of-the-art-patterson-garage/\">partnership with Waymo</a> to train students on autonomous vehicle technology, expanding hands-on learning and preparing students for promising jobs.</p><p>Graduates have gone on to work in good-paying positions across the automotive industry, with salaries for electric vehicle technicians ranging as high as <a href=\"https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Clean-Energy-Workforce-Development-and-Training/Energize-Your-Future/Careers-in-Electric-Vehicles-and-Charging/EV-Mechanic\">$90,000 per year</a> in New York. BCC’s approach can serve as a role model for other community colleges and technician training programs.</p><h3>A Time to Invest</h3><p>While the EV industry continues to innovate and expand, recent setbacks in federal clean transportation investments have hindered growth and slowed workforce development. Yet organizations like CBC and BCC are forging ahead and can light the way for others. Sustained investment in the workforce is essential: By leveraging proven training models from fleet operators and private sector partnerships, we can ensure workers are ready to adapt to new technology and take advantage of high-paying careers in their field.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Editor's note: This article was first published on Jan. 27, 2026. It was updated on Feb. 3 to reflect the latest information.</em></p><p>The United States faces a pressing energy challenge: how to ensure people have reliable and affordable electricity when deadly storms hit.</p><p>This need came into sharp focus over the past two weeks when a powerful winter storm swept across a huge swath of the U.S. from the Gulf Coast to New England, bringing with it heavy snowfall, freezing rain and subzero temperatures. It has, so far, caused blackouts to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/winter-storm-electric-grid-overdrive-00745690\">more than 1 million customers</a>, especially in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. Many are still without power.</p><p>Preparations made by utilities and grid operators — including staging extra line crews, positioning equipment in high-risk areas and ensuring backup generation and reserves were on standby — certainly helped prevent further widespread outages during Winter Storm Fern that hit the U.S. on Jan. 23. However, the cold, snowy conditions persisted over last weekend when a bomb cyclone brought low temperatures and triggered blackouts to tens of thousands of homes and businesses. </p><p>The bigger challenge now is long-term: reducing the number of blackouts by making power systems more reliable and still affordable in winter storms, and extreme weather in general.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><table class=\"table\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding: 0; width: 75px;\"><img alt=\"Profile photo.\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/220px/s3/2025-08/kelly-lefler_0.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 100%; display: inline; width: 75px;\" /></td><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/kelly-lefler\"><em><span style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\"><strong>Kelly Lefler</strong></span></em></a><em><span style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">, Senior Manager, Grid Decarbonization and Markets, WRI U.S. Polsky Energy Center</span></em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/kelly-lefler\">WRI energy expert Kelly Lefler</a> outlines what’s needed to strengthen the reliability of the electricity system and ensure people can count on constant, affordable power in the face of increasingly erratic weather. </p><h4>What is mostly behind the power outages during Winter Storm Fern?</h4><p>Utilities and regulators will assess records and publish official reports of what happened in the coming weeks and months, but for now it seems that the outages were largely due to the icy conditions affecting distribution and transmission systems. Ice from the storm built up on trees and the added weight caused them to snap, toppling power lines. The ice can also build up on the lines themselves and bring them down.</p><p>Also, in eastern U.S., some power plants couldn’t produce as much electricity because of the extreme cold and limited natural gas supplies, forcing them to shut down or run at reduced capacity. The region relies on natural gas pipelines along the East Coast, which are historically constrained during very cold weather. As a result, there were nearly 21 gigawatts of generation outages, with most of that capacity forced offline. To put that into perspective, 21 gigawatts (that's 21 billion watts) is enough to power millions of homes at the same time. Importantly, these disruptions did not require grid operators to impose rolling blackouts to prevent larger system failures.</p><h4>What makes the US electricity system vulnerable to winter storms and extreme cold? </h4><p>Winter storms tend to stress the electricity system — from power plants to transmission lines and distribution networks — in predictable ways that create an imbalance between supply and demand of electricity or make it harder to maintain safe grid conditions. When that happens, grid operators may be forced to take some electricity demand offline to prevent a larger, uncontrolled outage. While every major winter blackout has its own story, a few common failure points show up again and again.</p><p>In extreme cold, one of the biggest challenges is getting fuel to power plants for electricity generation and to homes for heating. Natural gas is the U.S.’s largest source of electricity generation, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61444#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20is%20the%20single,fired%20power%20plants%20vary%20significantly.\">providing 43% of electricity as of 2024</a>. During winter storms, demand for natural gas spikes as people turn up thermostats, while power plants also need the fuel to generate electricity. This simultaneous surge, known as coincident peak, is a well-known planning challenge. Extreme cold can strain the natural gas system beyond normal operating conditions, making it harder for gas-powered generators to access fuel when they need it the most. Similar stress can happen during extreme heat, when air conditioners drive up electricity demand.</p><p>Another issue is lack of proper winterization — preparing equipment for wintry conditions — across different parts of the electricity system. Equipment that isn’t prepared for extreme cold, such as power plants, sensors and natural gas wells and pipelines, can freeze or malfunction. When multiple pieces fail at once, utilities may have no choice but to implement widespread outages to maintain system safety and prevent cascading failures. </p><p>Winter conditions also make it harder for crews to maintain or repair equipment as problems arise, increasing the risk of outages.</p><p>Transmission and distribution systems can also be affected by winter storms. Ice and heavy snow can damage power lines, reduce their carrying capacity or cause mechanical problems, making it harder to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed — even when enough power is available. These lines are especially vulnerable without regular maintenance. For example, trimming trees near power lines is critical to prevent ice-laden branches from falling on them, as has happened during Winter Storm Fern. </p>\n\n      \n\n    \n    \n<div class=\"embedded-entity embed--block-type--in-this-series has-border-background-color\">\n      <h3 class=\"embed-block__title\">Related</h3>\n  \n  \n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-featured-items field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/energy\" hreflang=\"en\">Energy</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/grid-interconnection-for-energy-security\" hreflang=\"en\">Sharing Electricity Across Borders Could Bolster Energy Security</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            February 25, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Workers on a power transmission tower overlooking a river.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2025-02/china-ultra-high-voltage-transmission.jpg?VersionId=jAItqS.Fubc0hBDSySxxlbAoVLdyKcSU&h=41f55a5b&itok=EXQPwJNf\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/energy\" hreflang=\"en\">Energy</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/advanced-transmission-technologies-us-power-grid\" hreflang=\"en\">How Advanced Transmission Technologies Can Revamp the Aging US Power Grid</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            July 10, 2025\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"An electrician fixes a high-voltage transmission line above a traffic light.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2025-07/advanced-transmission-technologies.jpg?VersionId=eEMAehdOlg1HilwauMI9e5nsNeXeRd1a&h=fd5bd395&itok=k7SpoHhr\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n<h4>How can energy systems be made more reliable and affordable during weather shocks? </h4><p>There are several ways that energy systems can be made more reliable ahead of winter storms and extreme weather. Greater reliability helps prevent supply disruptions, eases pressure during peak demand periods and can keep power more affordable. </p><p>One of the key ways to make energy systems more reliable is by maximizing flexibility — improving how well the system can adapt in real time to changes in supply and demand. The more flexible the system, the better it can handle sudden demand spikes in the event of extreme weather, such as cold snaps or heat waves, or respond to supply disruptions such as plant outages.</p><p>Improving flexibility includes upgrading aging infrastructure. Much of the U.S. grid was built decades ago under different demand patterns. Modernizing the grid — by updating substations and transmission equipment, deploying advanced sensors and incorporating advanced transmission technologies (ATTs), for example — can reduce failure rates during extreme heat and cold. These technologies help operators detect problems quicker, reroute power if equipment is damaged and restore service fast. Modernization not only improves reliability but also reduces expensive emergency interventions and lowers long-term maintenance costs. </p><p>Increasing grid capacity, both through deployment of ATTs and building regional and interregional transmission lines, can reduce the risk of a local weather event turning into a widespread outage. Creating a more interconnected grid allows regions to share power during shortages. Having this greater transmission capacity also help keep prices down by allowing lower-cost electricity to reach areas facing higher demand. </p><p>Demand-side management options can help ease pressure on the system during extreme weather events. These include encouraging customers and large users to reduce or shift electricity use during peak periods in exchange for lower bills or leveraging distributed energy resources to help prevent shortages.</p><p>Systems that rely too much on a single fuel are more vulnerable to disruption. Diversification across energy sources and technologies helps reduce the risk of issues related to fuel shortages, infrastructure failures and localized weather impacts. </p><p>Finally, policy is also critical. It’s vital that incentives are properly aligned with modern needs for flexibility and preparedness. This can help utilities make system investments that really work in extreme weather and minimize costs to consumers in both the short and the long run. </p><h4>What role, if any, can clean energy play? </h4><p>While renewables are weather-dependent, broad geographic dispersion and forecasting allow them to <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/grid/extreme-weather-events\">contribute meaningfully during winter storms</a>. Wind and solar generation tend to be available during many extreme cold events, even when other resources are strained.  </p><p>In several recent cold-weather events, renewable generation was available when needed, even as some fossil fuel units were forced offline because of freezing equipment or fuel supply constraints. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-nerc-release-final-report-lessons-winter-storm-elliott\">during Winter Storm Elliott, only 7% of unavailable generating capacity</a> came from clean energy resources — that’s wind, solar, nuclear and hydro combined. And in some parts within the impacted region, wind and solar exceeded forecasts. </p><p>Clean energy also supports diversification. Adding a broader mix of energy sources reduces dependence on a single fuel or delivery system that may be disrupted during extreme weather. Resources that do not rely on “just-in-time\" fuel delivery, in which power plants receive fuel only when it is needed, can reduce exposure to fuel shortages when supply chains are strained.</p><h4>What role does climate change play in causing extreme cold and winter storms? </h4><p>The planet’s long-term temperature trajectory is rising. This means there is more energy in the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of extreme, erratic and unusual weather. For example, research suggests that a warming Arctic is linked to <a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/polar-jet-stream-and-polar-vortex\">polar jet stream instability</a>, which allows frigid Arctic air to spill farther south than it used to, producing sharp cold snaps even as average global temperatures rise.</p><p>Climate and weather are complex, and rising global temperatures are associated with an increased risk of a wide range of extremes, from brutal winters to long, intense hurricane seasons, record summer heat and historic flooding. At any given moment, different regions can experience very different extremes at the same time: while much of the U.S. grappled with the fallout of Winter Storm Fern, for example, many other regions around the world were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/czx3r2g51w6o\">simultaneously facing extreme heat</a>.</p><p>Climate change doesn’t just shift average temperatures. Evidence indicates that it’s also linked to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/extreme-heat-reshaping-urban-life\">extreme heat</a> and cold appearing in places that aren’t used to dealing with it and therefore aren’t adequately prepared for it. We’re in a new climate reality — making it even more critical to examine infrastructure, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/urban-heat-effect-solutions\">strengthen the weakest links</a> and work to drive down emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.  </p>",

The moment she steps beneath the trees, she feels her shoulders drop. <em>“</em>Green areas give us peace,” she said. “They bring calm, clean air, they help us feel alive.”</p><p>In Loja, it’s almost impossible to walk more than a few blocks without encountering a park, riverside trail or tree-lined hillside. Children ride bicycles along the water’s edge. Older residents stroll under shaded canopies. City workers prune, plant and clean these spaces every day, caring for more than 600 hectares (1,482 acres) of green areas that weave through this small city in South America’s Andes Mountains.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The green hillsides of the Loja forest in the Andes Mountains.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/loja-forest-andes-mountains_0.jpg?VersionId=01blRTYKjqCq_9gmMyHO8evCXAhiEeyg&itok=xC91JHrI\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Loja is a hillside city of 200,000 people in the Andean region of southern Ecuador. Photo by WRI.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For Ochoa, and the 200,000 Loja residents, these natural spaces are part of the city’s identity. They are places to breathe, unwind and reconnect with nature. The spaces are also intentional — a public health strategy, mobility network, ecological buffer and a source of civic identity all wrapped into one connected system. </p><h3>A Green Transformation</h3><p>Loja’s green transformation, which has become a living example of how <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\">nature-based solutions</a> can transform quality of city life, strengthen resilience and create a shared sense of pride, did not happen all at once.</p><p>For decades, the city built parks across its neighborhoods, but these spaces remained isolated from one another. At the same time, its rivers were polluted and degraded, ravines were eroding, hillsides lacked from erosion and habitat loss, and footpaths were disconnected and vulnerable to floods. City officials recalled how ravines would overflow during seasonal rains, flooding nearby neighborhoods and underscoring the urgency of restoring — and connecting green areas into a coherent system.</p><p>In 2017, Loja partnered with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and researchers from the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL) that addressed urban sprawl and the ecological degradation. UTPL researchers and municipal planners viewed Loja as a layered ecological and social structure shaped by its rivers, ravines and slopes. By connecting these elements through green corridors, they knew it would help both people and nature flourish.</p><p>Together, they created the Sistema Verde Urbano (Spanish for urban green system), a strategy that stitched together previously isolated parks, ravines and river corridors into a unified network built around a simple guiding belief, described by Diego Ramon, Loja’s director of territorial management, as “it’s easier to prevent than to heal.”</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A view of Loja, Ecuador shows streets, homes and a river running through the city.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/loja-ecuador-city-aerial_0.jpg?VersionId=nNCntyIh.B_rTW1UE7xeomZPmHxRarcf&h=0f4230fa&itok=cJEgqYIU\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Loja’s verdant urban landscape is visible from any angle. Photo by WRI.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Green Corridors Use Everyday Infrastructure for Well-Being</h3><p>In Loja, green space has become a fundamental part of how the city works. Sistema Verde Urbano extends through three major ecological corridors linked by rivers, ravines, forests, neighborhood parks and tree-lined streets. These corridors reduce heat, absorb stormwater and give residents safe spaces to move.</p><p>In interviews, residents described improvements in their physical activity, emotional well-being and daily habits. They mentioned that children have safe trails to reach playgrounds and sports fields, while seniors can walk along shaded routes to socialize and exercise Bike paths are no longer flooded during storms, letting commuters easily pass by, while hiking paths now weave through culturally significant lands. Loja resident Rodrigo León explained the impact simply: “When you come to these green spaces, your whole life changes emotionally, physically and mentally.”</p><p>The ecological function is equally significant. Restored riparian buffers have stabilized riverbanks and reduced the severity of seasonal flooding. Tree cover has expanded, shading key corridors and lowering temperatures. Eighteen new species of amphibians and plants have been identified and described in the region, underscoring the value that Loja’s ecosystems bring towards enhancing biodiversity.</p><p style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">For a city vulnerable to climate impacts, especially flooding and heat, these ecological gains translate into real benefits for daily life.</span></p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"An aerial view of the city of Loja.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/loja-ecuador_0.jpg?VersionId=mecqcZN_KK65GUnS9wQmHLevIYincfJ3&h=0f4230fa&itok=MZXIMJsz\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Green corridors throughout Loja reduce heat, absorb stormwater and give residents safe spaces to move. Photo by WRI.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>For Loja, ‘Verde’ Means More than Just Green</h3><p>Few cities in the region integrate water management as closely into city planning as Loja. Sistema Verde Urbano is designed to follow the natural flow of the Zamora and Malacatos rivers, which are not just the heart of the city but drain into 40 streams that impact the wider Andean watershed. The rivers connect the city, its hillsides, ravines and riverbanks into one continuous ecological system and were used to guide placements of parks, transportation routes and restoration zones. By treating the rivers as an integral part of the green system, Loja has turned them from once flood-prone and polluted sources of vulnerability into central elements of a safer and healthier city. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"City's infrastructure buildings are woven into the green hillsides of Loja.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/loja-river-infrastructure_0.jpg?VersionId=Gd9FGflDIDzjKRsR4ddLDZQP7bGrugaK&itok=4Dblxihw\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Loja’s wastewater treatment plant was designed to keep the rivers safe. Photo by WRI.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Protecting the rivers also means managing what flows into them, a commitment reflected in Loja’s wastewater system. The municipality’s wastewater treatment plant, which processes nearly all wastewater using a biological percolation system, returns clean water to the Zamora and Malacatos rivers. Sludge is repurposed to regenerate soils in hillside reforestation zones. The plant has become a national training hub, inspiring other municipalities to adopt similarly integrated watershed approaches.</p><p>Residents see this entire water system not only as infrastructure but also as part of Loja’s cultural identity. Trails extend from the urban center into forested hillsides where people hike, reflect and reconnect with nature.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A tree-lined river runs through the city of Loja.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/loja-river-backbone_0.jpg?VersionId=sFA_lJEhezfu_nYiokXgkn0gAOBzVJh9&h=0f4230fa&itok=LdhpWCSw\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Zamora and Malacatos rivers, protected by healthy tree cover, are the backbone of Sistema Urbano Verde, organizing the city’s water management, transportation, pedestrian pathways, and urban parks. Photo by WRI.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>A Green Backbone for Mobility</h3><p>One of Loja’s most distinctive achievements is the integration of mobility into its ecological plan. The city recognized early in its planning that walking and biking could only thrive if they were supported by nature, shade, safety, cooling and by streets designed for the people who use them most.</p><p>In Loja’s small city center, pedestrians outnumber vehicles by more than two to one, with women, children and older adults making up a large share of those walkers. Yet the streets were historically designed to prioritize cars. “Our data showed that the people walking were not the ones our streets were built for,” explained Maria Morales, a UTPL professor who worked on the mobility component of the Sistema Verde Urbano.</p><p>This evidence catalyzed the creation of wider sidewalks, temporary plazas and reclaimed road space that made pedestrian routes safer and more connected. “If there’s something that stresses citizens, it’s traffic,” said Luis Alonso Peña, Loja’s director of mobility. “Creating safer walking and transit routes helps reduce that stress.”</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"644\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Yellow decorations hang from trees lining streets and sidewalks filled with people during an arts festival.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/loja-arts-festival_0.jpg?VersionId=QzZ.vi3BF1oM.So0CqychZi5G9Hd7ACM&itok=Ava6T2Ig\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Loja’s vibrant street life is supported by its growing cycling and pedestrian network.

Although still under development, new segments already create continuous corridors that connect neighborhoods, parks and key destinations. These early links provide safer, cooler routes framed by the city’s expanding green infrastructure, an important step in a city where many residents rely on walking, biking and transit rather than private vehicles.</p><p>As the network expands, cycling is becoming a more viable option for everyday travel, complementing improvements in public transportation. “Inclusive transit connects the most vulnerable residents to work, education and health care,” Morales noted.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A  person wearing sunglasses and a hat rides a bicycle in a dedicated bike lane in Loja.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/loja-bike-lanes_0.jpg?VersionId=yrSGPncmJkEHPxiuBwWEAfdmLwZbDlY5&h=c11c9c1d&itok=FPb9LqAB\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Cycling networks create continuous paths of travel throughout Loja.

Because residents trust the university, they view Sistema Verde Urbano not as an external mandate but as a shared, locally-grounded project. Researchers continue to support monitoring, ecological design and long-term planning keeping the system tied to science as it expands. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People walk among a nursery filled with rows of plants and trees in Loja.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/loja-nursery_0.jpg?VersionId=QJ5kXi2mdaVRytlACBBk4JKRTw5Ry1M2&h=41f55a5b&itok=6LcstL-3\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Collaboration with the local university, Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja, has been central to the genesis of Sistema Verde Urbano as a social-ecological city-making framework.

Through this process, a unified strategy was created ensuring continuity across three mayoral administrations, embedding green infrastructure into municipal planning and making Sistema Verde Urbano the city’s operating framework. The project is financed by a multi-source model that blends municipal revenue, citizen fees and international financing.</p><p>Sistema Verde Urbano is also formalized in Loja’s Land Use Plan, Climate Action Plan 2040, and Green Mobility Plan making it a critical component designed to guide the city for decades.</p><p>Maintenance is visible and constant. Residents often comment on the reliability of the city’s teams who sweep corridors, repair benches, plant trees and keep parks clean. This creates a sense of confidence that the green system is here to stay.</p><p>At the same time, there is still more to build: Sidewalks, pathways and roadways must be extended; additional ravines need restoration; new parks and neighborhood amenities are planned in underserved areas. But residents see these as steps in a long-term journey, not obstacles.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Several soccer players play a game on a field in Loja.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/loja-football-soccer-park_0.jpg?VersionId=WafQA.3sVll5JFtUjgDWTVP9nWdtq9Qs&h=0a8b6f8b&itok=lk8I8urR\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Dozens of Loja’s neighborhood parks are enjoyed by citizens of all ages.

Cities such as Cuenca, Riobamba and Ambato are studying Sistema Verde Urbano as a model, and national programs led by GIZ have helped share Loja’s methodology across the Andean region. The appeal is clear: A system that protects water, cools neighborhoods, improves health, supports active mobility, strengthens community bonds and shapes land use brings value to residents and the city.</p><p>“You may have more money in bigger cities,” said Ochoa. “But we have a rich life here.”</p><p>Loja’s message to other cities is simple: Nature is not a luxury; it is the foundation for a healthier, more resilient and more connected future.<strong> </strong></p><p><em>Sistema Verde Urbano was selected as </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-wri-ross-center-prize-cities-names-five-finalists-transforming-health-and-daily-life\"><em>one of five finalists</em></a><em> for the </em><a href=\"https://prizeforcities.org/\"><em>2025-2026 WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities</em></a><em>, which celebrates projects and initiatives catalyzing healthy cities. The Grand Prize Winner, which will be selected by an independent jury and receive a $250,000 grand prize, will be awarded in April 2026. </em></p>",
