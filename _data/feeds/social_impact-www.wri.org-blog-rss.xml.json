And is a ton of “green” steel produced in a factory in Germany the same as “green” steel made in a factory in India?  </p><p>With <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/green-procurement-initiatives\">green procurement efforts underway</a>, agreeing on how to define green — or “low-carbon\" — products is increasingly important. Harmonized ways of determining an industrial product’s “embodied” greenhouse gas emissions are needed to avoid the patchwork of definitions that has emerged and enable industrial decarbonization policies,  such as green procurement programs or the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes tariffs on imported goods based on their carbon footprint.  </p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/emerging-green-standards-cement-and-steel-decarbonization\">New analysis from WRI</a> shows how global initiatives and governments are defining ‘green’ cement, concrete and steel products, and offers some recommendations for the way forward. </p><div class=\"report-teaser gold-borders-medium alignright\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-thumbnail\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">  <img alt=\"Cover image.\" class=\"image-style-_80x240-scale\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/180x240_scale/s3/2026-02/emerging-green-standards-for-cement-and-steel-decarbonization-cover-image_0.png?VersionId=t7DOEfkA.E_RwdSvsL9OxBtzF95CiMcI&itok=KK3krq7k\" width=\"180\" />\n\n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"text-wrapper\"><div class=\"h4 topic-tag\">EMERGING GREEN STANDARDS FOR CEMENT AND STEEL DECARBONIZATION</div><p><a class=\"button small\" href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/emerging-green-standards-cement-and-steel-decarbonization\">Download</a></p></div></div><h3>Why Is Product-level Emissions Accounting Important for Decarbonizing Heavy Industry? </h3><p>Depending on the purpose, emissions can be calculated at the product and facility level, all the way up to the company and country level. At the most granular level, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting helps industrial companies, governments and initiatives determine an industrial product’s <em>emissions intensity</em>, or how many tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are released per ton of product manufactured. </p><p>Once we have emissions intensity data for these products, governments can formulate policies that incentivize or mandate emissions intensity reductions. Effective emissions accounting and benchmarking enable the successful implementation of industrial decarbonization policies (see box below). Accurate product-level emissions reporting, accounting and benchmarking form the foundations of effective industrial decarbonization policies.</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Industrial decarbonization policies and product-level emissions accounting</strong></p><p>Several product-focused GHG mitigation measures — such as green procurement programs, carbon-based tariffs, and building codes requiring the use of low-carbon products — require consistent methods to calculate associated emissions and credible benchmarks to define what qualifies as a low-carbon product. Without robust standards for measuring emissions and determining low-carbon emissions intensity thresholds, these initiatives and policies cannot be implemented effectively.</p><p>Green procurement is a key example. As some of the largest consumers of cement, concrete, and steel, government entities can help reduce industrial emissions by exclusively purchasing versions of these products with few embodied GHG emissions. Companies can also participate in nongovernment green procurement programs, such as international initiatives like the First Movers Coalition, where companies commit to purchasing near-zero emissions products. However, these policies rely on emissions being measured consistently and assessed against clear benchmarks.</p><p>Climate-oriented trade policies, such as carbon border adjustments (CBAs), also depend on product-level emissions accounting. For example, the EU CBAM charges fees on imports into the EU based on their emissions intensity, meaning this policy requires verifiable methods to assess embodied emissions in products across both producers and countries.  </p><p>Other policies — like <a href=\"https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/CODGC2022P3/chapter-9-materials-and-resources\">embodied carbon limits in building codes</a>, <a href=\"https://steel.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-03/Taxonomy%20Brochure.pdf\">standalone green product taxonomies</a>, and newer innovative policies like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/toward-tradable-low-carbon-product-standard-steel-policy-design-considerations-united\">tradable low-carbon product standards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/next-generation-us-policies-industrial-innovation\">production tax credits</a> — can all incentivize industrial companies to reduce their emissions, as long as they are underpinned by reliable product-level emissions data and clearly defined low-carbon benchmarks. </p></div><h4>What do emissions accounting and benchmarking entail?</h4><p>When companies set net-zero targets and undertake corporate emissions accounting through the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a>, they need to account for emissions associated with their activities. This can include emissions from energy, raw material extraction and the upstream and downstream transport of products.</p><p>However, to support most of the policies discussed here, governments and companies need to account for emissions at the product level, rather than the facility level or the corporate level, as is the case with many other policies.  </p><p>Measuring the environmental footprint of a product involves several components: </p><ul><li><strong>Product Category Rules (PCRs):</strong> PCRs offer guidance for developing environmental product declarations (EPDs) for specific product types. They determine how to conduct life cycle assessments (LCAs) and establish the boundaries of emissions measurement as cradle-to-gate or cradle-to-grave. They ensure that LCAs for similar products are assessed in the same way and enable product comparison.</li><li><strong>Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs):</strong> LCAs measure the overall environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle, from raw material sourcing and use to end-of-life disposal or recycling. The data produced by LCAs form the foundation of reporting documents such as EPDs.</li><li><strong>Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs):</strong> EPDs provide comprehensive information on the environmental impacts of individual products. They are based on the results of LCAs and are developed using PCRs. Similar to nutrition labels on food products, EPDs summarize environmental impacts, which may include water consumption, pollution, eutrophication, acidification and global warming potential (GWP), using standardized metrics. However, EPDs do not determine whether a product’s global warming potential is low enough to be considered green or not; that is where benchmarking comes in (discussed in the next section).</li></ul><p>Companies can collect emissions data needed to produce EPDs or other forms of product-level emissions reporting using either measurement-based or calculation-based methods based on individual processes at their facilities.</p><p>However, product-level emissions accounting involves more than calculating the emissions from industrial processes. It also includes attributing those emissions to individual products so a product’s associated emissions data can be evaluated for policy compliance or certification. This attribution raises tricky emissions accounting dilemmas which governments and international initiatives grapple with in various ways, as explained later in this article.</p><h3>How Are Green Steel, Cement and Concrete Defined Around the World?</h3><p>In addition to accounting for a product’s emissions, some of the industrial decarbonization policies discussed above, such as embodied carbon limits in building codes and green procurement, require <em>emissions benchmarking</em>.</p><p>Product emissions benchmarking involves setting quantifiable emissions intensity targets or thresholds that a product must meet to comply with a policy. For example, for a hot-rolled structural steel product to be eligible for public procurement in California, it must be no more emissions-intensive than the established benchmark of 1.01 tons (t) of embodied CO2e per ton of steel.  </p><p>The initiatives and governments examined in the working paper use several different approaches to setting product-level emissions benchmarks, making comparisons difficult. In some cases, benchmarks don’t vary in stringency within individual product categories (see graphs below). </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27499204/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These static benchmarks can still have multiple tiers to accommodate different ambition levels. For example, the Indian government has developed an emissions-intensity taxonomy for finished steel with three different emissions-intensity performance tiers, ranging from the most ambitious five-star tier to the less ambitious three-star tier. To implement the now-halted Buy Clean program, the U.S. General Services Administration adopted benchmarks for cement at three different ambition levels, with procurement priority given to products meeting the highest tier. Such tiered approaches can encourage producers to exceed minimum benchmarks while allowing them to strive for higher targets according to feasibility.  </p><p>The First Movers Coalition, on the other hand, has established single, high-ambition emissions benchmarks to mobilize procurement of “near-zero emission” cement and steel in order to signal market demand for innovative, ultra-low-emissions cements.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27499882/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Some governments, including Türkiye and Ireland, have created ceilings for the amount of clinker — the most emissions-intensive ingredient in cement and concrete — allowed in cement and concrete used for public construction projects (see Figure 3). The goal is to minimize the climate impacts of government cement consumption.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27483021/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These “sliding scale” benchmarking approaches are contentious in the steel sector. By applying more stringent emissions intensity standards to steel products with higher scrap content, <a href=\"https://euric.org/resource-hub/position-papers/why-the-sliding-scale-is-a-slippery-slope-for-defining-green-steel\">critics argue</a> that these benchmarks unfairly penalize “secondary” steel producers that use electric arc furnaces to recycle scrap metal into usable steel products, avoiding coal-based iron smelting. <a href=\"https://www.responsiblesteel.org/news/public-statement-the-eu-label-for-steel-should-build-on-the-sliding-scale-approach\">Advocates counter</a> that scrap steel is insufficient to satisfy global steel demand and assert that secondary steel producers, alongside primary steel producers, should be incentivized to reduce their emissions to mitigate climate change.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27433574/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Canada has pursued a different way to address the scrap steel dilemma by<a href=\"https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/author/version/?id=e33c6800-6f6a-4fc8-b0e4-a0e10113c4ba\"> applying a credit of 585 kilograms of CO2e/t steel</a> to products based on the proportion of primary steel versus scrap-based secondary steel in a product, effectively reducing the product’s reported emissions compared to the benchmark. While similar in effect and intent to a dynamic sliding-scale benchmark, Canada’s approach differs in that it applies a proportionate adjustment to products’ performance against the static benchmark set by the government.</p><h3>The Differing Approaches to Emissions Accounting </h3><p>While differences in benchmarking approaches and emissions intensity thresholds can lead producers to pursue different targets (and markets), differences in emissions accounting methodologies can make it difficult to translate and compare products’ climate impact.  </p><p>In their recent working paper, the authors identified several key differences in how emissions are accounted for at the product level, including: </p><ul><li><strong>Life cycle stages included:</strong> Most standards require accounting for emissions from “cradle-to-gate”, which includes raw material extraction and transport as well as product manufacturing. However, some standards, like those from the <a href=\"https://globalsteelclimatecouncil.org/the-standard/\">Global Steel Climate Council</a>, require accounting for emissions from the entire life cycle — or “cradle-to-grave” — including product use and end-of-life disposal or recycling.</li><li><strong>Where policies apply in the supply chain:</strong> While some governments and initiatives apply emissions intensity benchmarks to cement, others apply them to concrete. In the steel sector, policymakers have to choose between crude steel or multiple other steel product categories, each with different average emissions intensities.</li><li><strong>Inclusion of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) and/or carbon dioxide removal offsets:</strong> Most standards offer explicit guidance on how to account for emissions reduced through CCUS. In rare cases, policies or initiatives allow companies to purchase carbon dioxide removal offsets from third parties outside their supply chain to lower their products’ reported emissions intensity.</li><li><strong>Accounting for avoided emissions from biomass and waste utilization:</strong> Utilizing biomass- and non-industrial waste-derived products to replace fossil-based fuels and feedstocks can avoid consumption of natural gas, oil and coal, along with their associated emissions. However, burning these biomass- and waste-derived fuels to produce cement still generates GHG emissions, albeit emissions that might have otherwise come from <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/land-research/quantifying-methane-emissions-landfilled-food-waste\">landfills and decomposition of organic matter</a>. Some standards allow steel and cement producers to account for the net emissions impact of waste utilization.</li><li><strong>Allocating emissions to byproducts and co-products used in different value chains:</strong> Industrial waste and byproducts, like steel slag, can sometimes be used to replace emissions-intensive ingredients such as cement clinker. While many accounting standards prohibit allocating emissions from the primary product to waste products, some standards, like <a href=\"https://lowemissionsteelstandard.org/\">Low Emission Steel Standard, LESS</a>, offer emissions reduction credits for waste and byproducts sold to replace clinker.</li><li><strong>Use of chain of custody models:</strong> <a href=\"https://isealalliance.org/get-involved/resources/chain-custody-models-and-definitions-v2-2025\">Chain of custody models</a> are used to track the emissions-related characteristics of materials through supply chains, from raw material extraction to manufacturing to sale. For example, if a facility receives two different types of raw materials (input) — one with lower emissions and another with higher emissions — and combines them to produce multiple outputs, a chain of custody model outlines how to follow these input materials through the supply chain and how their distinct emissions characteristics are allocated among the outputs.</li></ul><p>These differences in emissions accounting standards make it difficult for policymakers and companies to compare certified products. Low-carbon industrial producers seeking to trade their products across borders and capitalize on incentives for green industrial production would have to invest scarce resources to comply with overlapping emissions accounting and reporting standards. </p><h3>What’s Next: Streamlining Global Low-Carbon Product Standards </h3><p>Given how much steel is traded internationally and how much cement and concrete producers can benefit from green procurement programs, incompatible policies and standards can hinder climate-oriented trade and procurement and, in turn, slow the development of markets for low-carbon cement, concrete and steel.  </p><p>To drive low-carbon industrial innovation, governments and standards-setting organizations need to coordinate to streamline and increase the effectiveness of the global landscape of low-carbon benchmarks and standards, focusing on a few key objectives and strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Improving emissions data availability, quality and transparency</strong> through investments in ubiquitous emissions data accounting and reporting.</li><li><strong>Leveraging existing standards in government policy</strong> to avoid duplication and improve interoperability.</li><li><strong>Harmonizing standards across borders</strong> and within domestic national and subnational policies and pursuing global standards alignment where possible.</li><li><strong>Considering and adjusting for impacts on small-scale producers</strong> during policymaking and standard-setting.</li><li><strong>Incorporating human health impacts of industrial activity</strong> into procurement and trade policy.</li><li><strong>Establishing a benchmark convergence timeline</strong> to build the foundation for globally unified, net-zero-aligned standards for green cement, concrete and steel products in the future. </li></ul><p>When implemented effectively, green procurement programs, climate-oriented trade measures and other industrial decarbonization policies can accelerate the development and market share of innovatively produced, lower-carbon industrial materials. But to achieve this, policymakers must prevent the emergence of an inefficient web of overlapping and contradictory standards.</p><p>Recent developments at the 2025 UN Climate Summit (COP30) signal promising signs of progress. But efforts to align standards are only just beginning. And policymakers must ensure that the process is inclusive, multilateral, forward-looking and streamlined.</p><p>While these efforts will be difficult, they are needed to avoid linking industrial sustainability initiatives to economic hardship for producers developing innovative, low-carbon materials.  </p>",

      "description": "<p>The world is devoting more and more money to tackling climate change. Globally, climate finance investments <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2025/\">increased by 26%</a>, from $1.5 to $1.9 trillion, between 2021 and 2023. Private-sector climate finance reached $1 trillion for the first time the same year. Despite headwinds, finance continues to flow. While we have yet to see how <a href=\"https://donortracker.org/publications/budget-cuts-tracker\">cuts to overseas development assistance</a> in 2026 will impact this trend long term, calls for increased climate finance have never been greater.</p><p>But getting more money flowing is only part of the equation. As climate finance increases, it is more important than ever to ensure that these investments are used effectively and actually achieve their intended objectives.</p><p>Part of the challenge is that climate finance is a complicated landscape, populated by a wide range of stakeholders with differing levels of power and influence. For those trying to access climate finance — or pushing for greater accountability in the space — it can be difficult to navigate. Yet there are clear steps that governments, donors and the private sector can take to help address these hurdles.</p><p>Open governance is key. To ensure the best outcomes, climate finance needs to be <strong>transparent</strong>, allowing stakeholders and civil society to see where funds are flowing; <strong>participatory</strong>, so that communities, especially those most impacted, have a say in the process; and <strong>accountable</strong>, so that there’s recourse when funds aren’t used as intended.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/transparency-participation-and-accountability-financing-climate-action\">new WRI report</a>, published as part of the <a href=\"https://www.greenaccountabilitynow.org/\">Green Accountability Platform,</a> takes stock of the current landscape of climate finance governance and examines how to improve transparency, participation and accountability across finance sources to ensure that funds are truly aligned with achieving the world’s climate goals.</p><h3>Transparency: Some Progress, but More to Be Done</h3><div class=\"report-teaser gold-borders-medium alignright\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1294\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1000\" />\n              <source height=\"1294\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1000\" />\n              <source height=\"1249\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"983\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"589\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cover image.\" height=\"589\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/transparency-participation-accountability-financing-climate-action-cover-image_0.png?VersionId=O4CrODd2bZ8MRUaxSzfN76wR1o5l_elc&itok=If5WSpIP\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"text-wrapper\"><div class=\"h4 topic-tag\">Transparency, Participation and Accountability in Financing Climate Action</div><p>This paper examines how sources of climate finance are integrating open governance principles of transparency, participation and accountability into their processes and pinpoints areas for improvement.</p><p><a class=\"button small\" href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/transparency-participation-and-accountability-financing-climate-action\">Download</a></p></div></div><p>Transparency is critical to ensuring that funds destined for climate action reach the intended projects. It helps build trust among stakeholders when all involved can clearly see where finance is flowing. And it is a starting point for pinpointing issues and holding institutions accountable for their policies and performance.</p><p>There are ongoing efforts to make climate finance flows more transparent. Some national governments, like in <a href=\"https://apps5.mineco.gob.pe/cambioclimatico2023/Navegador/default.aspx\">Peru</a> and <a href=\"https://finanzasdelclima.dnp.gov.co/movilizacionrecursos/generacion-conocimiento/Paginas/sistema-mrv-de-financiamiento-climatico.aspx\">Colombia</a>, are implementing climate‐budget tagging and systems that track funding from various sources. International organizations are also spearheading transparency efforts, including the OECD’s climate finance reporting and the UNFCCC’s Biennial Transparency Reports. And civil society initiatives continue to push for more granular disclosure of public budget information and government decision making. For example, <a href=\"https://senegal.budgit.org/\">BudgIT Foundation Senegal</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gflac.org/\">Climate Finance Group for Latin American and the Caribbean (GFLAC)</a> use budget data and financial tracking to reveal inconsistencies in climate spending and push for funding designs with stronger climate and social benefits.</p><p>Yet, without stronger mechanisms to ensure transparency, climate finance risks falling short of its transformative potential — particularly in vulnerable countries where accountability and equitable distribution are most critical.</p><p>Our report offers recommendations to strengthen transparency not only in financial flows, but throughout the entire project cycle. This includes making project‐level climate finance data accessible to the public and ensuring that communities are actively involved in project design, implementation, and outcome‐focused consultations led by the project developer. Establishing open governance mechanisms — such as national committees, multi‐stakeholder roundtables, and regional or local commissions that formally include civil society organizations — can significantly increase transparency across the project cycle.  </p><h3>Participation: Needs to Increase at All Levels</h3><p>Many of the most consequential decisions about how climate finance is planned, allocated and used are still made through closed-door negotiations between governments and funders, with limited opportunities for public input. Our research found that while high-level strategies and reporting are often public, the point of project selection, when funding decisions are made, frequently remains opaque. And consultations can be on paper rather than practice. Communities near these projects are often consulted only after key choices have already been set in motion.</p><p>When participation comes later, projects start on weaker footing. Without local input, investments can overlook community priorities or underestimate social and environmental risks, leading to delays and other complications. In many countries, for example, infrastructure or renewable energy projects approved without early consultation have faced <a href=\"https://swedwatch.org/themes/report-human-rights-defenders-at-risk-in-the-renewable-energy-transition/\">land-use disputes</a>. This can force construction to pause and plans to be revised, turning preventable issues into costly setbacks for funders, communities and the climate.</p><p>These project-level gaps rarely arise in isolation. They are often the impact of limited participation in earlier policy and planning processes. Civil society organizations often struggle to engage in policymaking. Public entities may lack a legal mandate or proper outreach mechanisms to do so, and policy information is often prohibitively technical or inaccessible. This is an opportunity for governments to create clear consultation processes and present information in user‐friendly formats to ensure meaningful public participation.</p><p>Early and intentional engagement can lead to better results, too. WaterAid Bangladesh shows what this can look like in practice: In some low-income communities in the country, residents face unreliable access to potable water and seasonal flooding. When technical solutions are developed without proper consultation, they can be poorly sited, unaffordable to maintain or underused. By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.wateraid.org/bd/\">WaterAid Bangladesh</a> has demonstrated how involving communities throughout the project cycle, from needs assessment through to design, construction and monitoring, can lead to water and sanitation investments that better reflect local priorities and reach the most vulnerable households.</p><p>Expanding participation across the climate finance system, from international funds to national planning and project implementation, can help ensure that climate investments drive positive impact. When communities have a voice in how resources are prioritized and delivered, investments are more likely to address real risks, avoid unintended harms and be sustained after funding ends. This means providing dedicated resources for participation, embedding engagement at policy and project levels, and supporting community-level outreach throughout the project cycle.</p><h3>Accountability: Currently Low, but with Opportunities to Build on Existing Systems</h3><p>Transparency and participation are key pillars of good open governance — but they only work well when paired with accountability mechanisms. To drive real change in climate finance systems, civil society organizations and other stakeholders need viable pathways to ensure that projects are carried out as planned and achieve the intended results.</p><p>Most existing mechanisms to hold governments accountable were not designed specifically for climate finance, limiting their application and posing a challenge to good open governance in this field. Yet there is no need to reinvent the wheel: Climate finance can build on and expand the use of established mechanisms to strengthen oversight and complete the cycle — from transparency and participation to accountability.</p><p>Some accountability tools stem from broader regulatory and institutional frameworks that, while not specifically tailored for climate change, have significant potential to strengthen oversight for climate finance.</p><p>Supreme audit institutions, for example, can scrutinize the use of public funds and assess whether climate-related expenditures align with stated objectives. The <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/webpub/eca/special-reports/sustainable-finance-22-2021/en/index.html\">European Court of Auditors</a> evaluated the 2018 EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan to determine whether it was implemented effectively and directing capital toward sustainable investments. It found that, while the action plan established important tools, such as the EU taxonomy and new disclosure requirements, its implementation was uneven and insufficient to spur change. As a result, the European Court of Auditors recommended stronger oversight. The findings helped strengthen accountability for the plan.</p><p>Similarly, court systems provide a legal avenue to challenge mismanagement, enforce compliance, and uphold commitments made by governments or private entities. In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Corruption-and-integrity-risks-in-climate-solutions.pdf.\">Taiwan</a> faced a corruption investigation involving several Yunlin County council members and local officials accused of taking bribes connected to a major wind energy development project. Those facing charges were ultimately convicted and given jail terms.</p><p>Finally, as always, understanding the informal norms, relationships and incentives that shape who exercises power — the political economy — is key. Scholarship on <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17565529.2022.2027741#abstract\">adaptation projects</a> in Bangladesh has demonstrated that corruption in local adaptation projects was reduced when influential households found it was in their interest to monitor public officials and contractors.</p><p>By leveraging these existing mechanisms, climate finance can benefit from established traditions of accountability, ensuring that diverse sources of finance — public, private, domestic and international — are held to consistent standards.</p><h3>Climate Finance Governance as a Catalyst for Impact</h3><p>As global climate investments reach unprecedented levels, the world cannot afford for these resources to fall short of their potential. Evidence from the Green Accountability Platform shows a simple truth: Climate finance is only as strong as the governance behind it. Transparency builds trust, participation ensures local relevance, and accountability keeps climate action on track. When any of these pillars is weak, funding risks being misdirected or misaligned with community and climate needs.</p><p>Fortunately, meaningful progress is within reach. Governments, international funders and private‐sector actors can continue to strengthen transparency through better disclosure, create space for early and continuous public participation, and leverage established accountability systems to monitor whether climate commitments translate into real outcomes on the ground. These improvements are not just good governance practices — they are essential conditions for delivering resilient communities, equitable transitions and genuine emissions reductions.</p><p>As climate finance continues to grow, so must our commitment to stewarding it responsibly.</p><p><em>To learn more about these recommendations and the path forward, </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/transparency-participation-and-accountability-financing-climate-action\"><em>read WRI’s new report</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

It was updated on Feb. 19 to reflect the latest information.</em></p><p>The United States is <a href=\"https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2025#:~:text=countries%20%2D%202025%20report-,Main%20findings,increased%20by%2074.9%25%20since%201990.\">one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters</a>. Regulating those emissions is critical to <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-mitigation-reducing-emissions\">slow climate change</a> and protect Americans from <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/air-pollution#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20major%20threat,over%20the%20past%20two%20decades.\">deadly air pollution</a>.</p><p>Yet on Feb. 12, 2026, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made regulating greenhouse gas emissions much harder. The agency finalized a rule <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">overturning its own “endangerment finding”</a> — established after years of scientific analysis — that concluded that greenhouse gas pollution endangers human health and requires regulation. At the same time, the EPA repealed emissions standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p>This matters because under <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act\">the Clean Air Act</a>, one of the U.S.’ foundational environmental laws, the EPA is legally required to regulate pollutants once it determines they endanger public health and the environment. By repealing the endangerment finding, the EPA removes the scientific and legal basis that requires federal regulation of greenhouse gases, weakening protections for people, the environment and the economy.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><table class=\"table table-style-align-center\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding: 0; width: 75px;\"><img alt=\"Profile photo.\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/2025-08/david-widawsky_0.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 100%; display: inline; width: 75px;\" /></td><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/david-widawsky\"><em><strong>David Widawsky</strong></em></a><em>, Director, WRI's U.S. Program</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/david-widawsky\"><strong>WRI U.S. Director and climate expert David Widawsky</strong></a> breaks down what is at stake for U.S. households, why this deregulation could increase legal risks for businesses and what comes next.</p><h4>What is the EPA's endangerment finding?</h4><p>Let’s break down what the endangerment finding is and why it matters. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">In 2009</a>, after years of extensive scientific review, EPA officially determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. This “endangerment finding,” as it’s known, was based on overwhelming evidence from EPA’s own experts, the <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/national-academies-publish-new-report-reviewing-evidence-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-u-s-climate-health-and-welfare\">U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine</a>, and the scientific community that shows that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from extracting and burning fossil fuels <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/epa-endangerment-finding-fs.pdf\">drive global climate change</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">harm people</a>.</p><p>The finding was legally critical. Under the U.S. Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to regulate substances that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7408#:~:text=and%20control%20techniques-,U.S.%20Code,(C)\">“cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”</a> Once the EPA made that determination for greenhouse gases, the agency was legally obligated to act. The finding became the legal foundation for federal climate policy, including regulating vehicle, industrial and power plant emissions and treating climate change as a public health issue under the EPA’s authority.</p><h4>What does the repeal of the endangerment finding mean? </h4><p>After 16 years, spanning multiple U.S. administrations and Congresses, the EPA has now issued <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-07/420d25003.pdf\">a rule saying that the scientific evidence and legal interpretation</a> behind the endangerment finding were wrong and must be rescinded. This doesn’t eliminate all regulation of air pollution. The <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/naaqs/ozone-o3-air-quality-standards\">EPA still regulates pollutants such nitrous oxide and ozone</a>. But the repeal specifically targets the <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/massachusetts-v-epa\">legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases from extracting and burning fossil fuels</a>.</p><p>The impact is sweeping. The endangerment finding underpinned regulations across multiple sectors, including emissions limits for consumer vehicles, commercial vehicles and heavy-duty trucks, standards for <a href=\"https://woods.stanford.edu/news/epa-endangerment-finding-explained-5-facts-about-science-and-health-risks\">coal-fired and natural gas power plants</a>, and federal sustainability requirements that <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way\">shape government procurement and broader market behavior</a>.</p><p>It also served as a justification for grant programs aimed at reducing emissions, many of which were already <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-green-bank-zeldin-climate-trump-5168d11b7f63aeaf72001b50221c3c19\">eliminated in last year’s congressional</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-house-targets-big-climate-clean-energy-rollbacks-budget-proposal-2025-05-12/\">reconciliation bill</a>. In practical terms, without the endangerment finding, regulating greenhouse gas emissions is no longer a legal requirement. The science hasn’t changed, but the obligation to act on it has been removed. </p><h4>What are the implications for people and livelihoods?  </h4><p>Without federal action to curb emissions, the impacts of climate change will only intensify, and American families will bear the financial and health burden. The impacts are both immediate and long-term. Many are already happening.</p><p>For example, climate change-related impacts are already <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings\">increasing food costs</a>. Beef prices are <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings#:~:text=Farm-level%20cattle%20prices%20were,egg%20production%20continues%20to%20recover.\">rising to record highs</a> as <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/08/14/human-emissions-drove-megadrought-western-us#:~:text=Greenhouse%20gas%20and%20aerosol%20emissions,lead%20author%20of%20the%20study.\">droughts</a> in western states, <a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/news/new-research-finds-rising-heat-driving-western-us-droughts-2024-11-08\">intensified by rising temperatures</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/sector-at-a-glance\">drastically reduced usable grazing land and cattle herds</a>. Thousands of acres of <a href=\"https://www.farmprogress.com/vegetables/florida-vegetable-crops-hit-by-arctic-air-mass\">vegetables in Florida</a> and the Southeast have likely been destroyed by extreme cold snaps. <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/economic-impact-climate-change-northwest-farms\">Climate change is affecting food production</a> by altering growing conditions and increasing the frequency of extreme weather, such as drought, heat or extreme cold. This can have <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/economic-impact-climate-change-northwest-farms#:~:text=As%20the%20impacts%20of%20climate,rising%20temperatures%20and%20declining%20snowpack.\">negative economic effects</a> on both farmers and consumers.</p><p>Families may <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/reduce-heat-islands\">face higher energy bills</a>, <a href=\"https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/study-finds-emergency-room-visits-rise-sharply-hotter-days-california\">increased emergency room visits</a> in some regions and rising health care costs associated with heat waves and poorer air quality. <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2791\">Insurance premiums will likely rise</a> as climate disasters become more frequent and severe. In some areas, <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2791\">coverage is becoming harder to obtain or afford</a>, which can affect <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/future-proofing-real-estate-investment_2dd12063-en/full-report/from-climate-related-shocks-to-financial-risks_d85d5492.html\">mortage affordability and depress home values</a>, which, in turn, reduces <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2024/12/climate-risks-present-a-significant-threat-to-the-u-s-insurance-and-housing-markets\">local tax revenue</a> and funding for schools, police and other amenities.</p><p>At the community level, increasing floods, fires and droughts <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/water\">will strain water and energy systems</a>. Some places <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/09/climate-disasters-displaced-250-million-people-in-past-10-years-un-report-finds\">may even become unlivable</a> from being too expensive, too unstable or simply too dangerous to stay. The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01721\">costs compound</a> from <a href=\"https://www.germanwatch.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Climate%20Risk%20Index%202025.pdf\">infrastructure repairs</a>, emergency response and displacement. </p><h4>What are the implications for businesses? </h4><p><a href=\"https://riskybusiness.org/uploads/files/RiskyBusiness_PrintedReport_FINAL_WEB_OPTIMIZED.pdf\">Businesses may face higher costs</a> due to rising <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/whats-driving-us-electricity-prices\">electricity prices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/climate-risk-for-insurers\">rising insurance costs</a> to cover climate disaster recovery. </p><p>In addition, the repeal could potentially create unexpected legal risks for some businesses. The endangerment finding has provided certain legal protections for companies, as the existence of federal climate regulation has been <a href=\"https://www.climatecasechart.com/collections/american-electric-power-co-v-connecticut_45acf3\">a factor when dismissing some lawsuits</a>. Its removal may change this legal landscape for businesses, possibly exposing power plant operators and other companies <a href=\"https://www.businessinsurance.com/trumps-repeal-of-climate-rule-opens-new-pathway-for-litigation/\">to litigation</a>. </p><h4>Why are vehicle emissions being repealed alongside the endangerment finding? </h4><p>The endangerment finding <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep549/usrep549497/usrep549497.pdf\">originated </a>from a specific section of the Clean Air Act that deals with vehicle emissions. This <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a\">section </a>required the EPA to determine whether pollution from vehicles endangers health and welfare. </p><p>Once the EPA made that <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2009/12/15/E9-29537/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-for-greenhouse-gases-under-section-202a-of-the-clean\">determination</a> for greenhouse gases from vehicles in 2009, the agency <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/document/events-leading-to-regulation-of-greenhouse-gases-under-the-clean-air-act/#:~:text=With%20the%20endangerment%20finding%20released%2C%20EPA%20was,Section%20202(a)%20of%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act.\">used the same finding</a> as the legal foundation for regulating emissions from other sources like <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/23/2015-22837/standards-of-performance-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-new-modified-and-reconstructed-stationary\">power plants, buildings</a> and other forms of <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/11/2020-28882/control-of-air-pollution-from-airplanes-and-airplane-engines-ghg-emission-standards-and-test\">transport</a>. So, the vehicles were ground zero but the implications spread far beyond cars and trucks.</p><p>By repealing vehicle emissions standards first, the EPA is targeting the most direct application of the endangerment finding. But it sets up a domino effect. If the finding doesn’t apply to vehicles, where it originated, it <a href=\"https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EPAs-Proposal-to-Eliminate-the-Endangerment-Finding-and-Motor-Vehicle-Greenhouse-Gas-Regulations.pdf\">undermines the legal basis</a> for greenhouse gas regulations across all sectors. That’s why the two repeals are linked. </p><h4>Can the repeal be challenged?</h4><p>A number of entities already <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/media/edf-ucs-file-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-secret-convening-climate-skeptics-use-their\">filed lawsuits in 2025</a> challenging the EPA’s initial steps to repeal the endangerment finding. With publication of the final rule, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/18/trump-epa-environment-climate-lawsuit\">whole slew of new legal actions</a> challenging the endangerment revocation were quickly filed by public health, scientific and environmental organizations. More lawsuits are sure to follow. Clearly, something this important, in place for 16 years, won’t go without a fight.  </p><h4>What does the endangerment finding repeal mean for US leadership in the world? </h4><p>By <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/\">withdrawing</a> from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in early 2026, the U.S. became the only nation refusing to participate in climate change discussions and negotiations. Other countries are not following the U.S. in abandoning climate targets, and some have <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/trumps-words-arent-stopping-many-countries-from-setting-higher-climate-goals/\">reaffirmed or even raised their climate goals</a> despite U.S. pressure.</p><p>However, the rest of the world takes notice when the U.S. turns its back on rock-solid science and tries to convince people to not believe their own eyes — and wallets. The U.S. <a href=\"https://theloop.ecpr.eu/us-withdrawal-from-major-environmental-international-organisations-weakens-its-credibility/\">risks losing trust</a> among friends and allies that its policy decisions are grounded in facts and science and that it’s a reliable partner. Other nations, like <a href=\"https://eccoclimate.org/what-are-the-challenges-facing-europe-and-the-world-in-2026/\">China</a>, will position themselves as reliable partners and economic leaders just as the U.S. pulls back.</p><p>Moving away from science doesn’t just weaken U.S. environmental and public health policies. It threatens U.S. leadership on every issue where credibility matters, from <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/step-back-from-climate-cooperation-will-hurt-us-economy-statement-from-un-climate-chief-on-us\">trade and finance</a> to <a href=\"https://www.policycenter.ma/publications/turning-back-clock-industrial-economic-and-diplomatic-fallout-us-climate-policy#:~:text=The%20second%20Trump%20administration's%20reversal,%2C%20and%20renewable%2Denergy%20manufacturing.\">industry competitiveness</a> to national <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/17/us-military-has-cared-about-climate-change-dawn-of-cold-war-good-reason.html\">security</a>.  </p><p> </p><p><em>Correction, 02/13/2025: A previous version of this article stated that droughts have drastically reduced \"grazing land\".

      "description": "<p>Early on a weekday morning in Atlanta, a familiar choreography unfolds along a landscaped path: High school students stream north to class; middle schoolers head south, backpacks bouncing as they bike; electric scooters zip past joggers and dog walkers, while parents stroll with coffee in hand. Just a generation ago, these scenes didn’t exist.</p><p>Once an abandoned freight rail, the Atlanta Beltline — which opened its first section in 2012 — is now a 22-mile loop that’s become a vibrant network of trails, parks, affordable housing and local businesses.</p><p>\"Before the Beltline, Atlanta was not the kind of place you wanted to be on a bicycle,\" said Ryan Gravel, an urban planner whose graduate thesis sparked the Beltline’s creation. Now, things are different. \"If it were earlier in the morning, we'd see my son riding his bike to school. It's crazy that you can do that,\" he said.</p><p>For a fast-growing city long defined by traffic and sprawl, the question of how Atlanta develops has outsized stakes. But the Beltline is showing how rapid urban growth can be healthy, climate-friendly and joyful.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Throngs of people walk and ride bikes on a tree-lined pathway along the Atlanta Beltline.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-eastside-trail-spring_0.jpg?VersionId=6xtlWRfHHDg5SQhQ7Dx_x_PmYQFfuAV.&h=a504c449&itok=mZxQU8Ib\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Pedestrians and cyclists share a shaded stretch of the Atlanta Beltline, designed to support safe, active movement through the city.  Photo by Erin Sintos.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>‘Your Favorite Place of Joy’</h3><p>Each year, more than 2 million people experience the Beltline, a connective spine linking 45 previously fragmented neighborhoods. For decades, highways and rail lines sliced through the city, often isolating historically Black communities. As sprawl and car dependence accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s, families found themselves disconnected from jobs, nature and essential services. What started as an ambitious vision to repurpose defunct rail lines has grown into a far-reaching effort to heal historic divides, restore public space and chart a healthier city.</p><p>“If you’ve never been to Atlanta, just think about your favorite place of joy,” said Clyde Higgs, president and CEO of Atlanta Beltline, Inc. (ABI), the quasi-public organization that leads the project. “All the things you care about as a person, the Beltline provides that for you. It connects everything you love without having to get into a personal vehicle.”</p><p>Higgs described the Beltline as “the people’s project” — an initiative shaped by community input and designed to support healthy living, bringing green infrastructure, affordable housing, economic opportunity and transit together along a shared corridor.  </p><p>“The days of developing green space in isolation are gone,” he said. “This is a truly comprehensive redevelopment project.”</p><div class=\"bullets border-small\"><div class=\"h4 bottom-border-tiny-black\">In this Series: WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities Finalists </div>\n\n      \n\n\n\n<div class=\"embedded-entity embed--block-type--in-this-series\">\n  \n  \n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-featured-items field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/cities\" hreflang=\"en\">Cities</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/loja-ecuador-urban-nature-healthy-city\" hreflang=\"en\">This Hillside City in South America Rebuilt Itself Around Nature — and Got Healthier</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  Insights\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            February 3, 2026\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"A group of people rollerblade on a pathway in Loja, Ecuador.\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2026-02/loja-parquezamora-rollerblading_0.jpg?VersionId=FpbdROR9ufIyefVkcp_1_RyqObkkidB6&h=b278459c&itok=nzIssW_G\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <div class=\"teaser-item\">\n      <div class=\"tags topic-tag margin-top-xs\">\n      \n  <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/cities\" hreflang=\"en\">Cities</a>\n\n      \n    </div>\n      <div class=\"teaser__inner-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"left-section margin-bottom-xs\">\n              <h3 class=\"teaser-title margin-top-xs\">\n          \n    <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-wri-ross-center-prize-cities-names-five-finalists-transforming-health-and-daily-life\" hreflang=\"en\">RELEASE: WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities Names Five Finalists Transforming Health and Daily Life in Cities</a>\n\n\n        </h3>\n                    <span class=\"content-type-region bundle\">\n          \n  News\n\n        </span>\n                    <span class=\"date-region date\">\n              \n            January 28, 2026\n      \n  \n\n\n        </span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"right-section margin-top-xs margin-bottom-xs\">\n                  \n    <img alt=\"Bike rider on a green urban bike lane\" class=\"image-style-_25x95\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/125x95/s3/2026-01/istock-1404165598-1000px_0.jpg?VersionId=OfDXx2543geVl2HvkTa52tN6hGLKBhnt&h=82f92a78&itok=lQwS5Ssx\" width=\"125\" />\n\n\n\n\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div><h3>Making Health the Heart of the Beltline</h3><p>Health is central to the Beltline’s success. By design, it encourages walking, running and cycling as part of daily life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the corridor became a lifeline for many city residents, one of the few places where people could move, connect and breathe freely.</p><p>“One of the unsung heroes of the Beltline is health,” Higgs said. “And we’re talking about the whole spectrum of that word.”</p><p>The Beltline hosts the largest free fitness program in the southeastern U.S., offering residents a range of classes, from yoga to Zumba, held in public parks and along the trail. Health fairs bring mobile clinics and screening vans directly onto the Beltline through partnerships with the American Heart Association and local health departments. Programs support mental well-being and social connections, too.</p><p>“We get to see folks lose weight through our programs,” said Tamia Goodman, associate director of Engage Programs for ABI and an Atlanta native. “We connect people to health resources, allowing them to get screened for the first time for chronic issues they didn’t realize they had.” Walking, she added, is more than exercise — it’s a tool for mindfulness and community connection.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1051\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"644\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"304\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two people reach for a bucket while planting trees along the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum.\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-arboreum.jpg?VersionId=5Nes86WmJyy0thBjdsY9ytfcScWs4Miy&itok=uBKNcrRU\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Volunteers with Trees Atlanta care for plantings along the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum through hands-on stewardship and maintenance.

Through a long-standing partnership with Trees Atlanta, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the city’s urban forest, more than 7,000 trees have been planted, transforming former industrial land into a vibrant ecosystem. Once completed, it's projected to be the world's longest linear arboretum.</p><p>“The corridor was once a place of dumping and <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/indiana/stories-in-indiana/kudzu-invasive-species/\">invasive plants like kudzu</a>,” said Greg Levine, executive director of Trees Atlanta, who lives along the Eastside Trail. “Now it’s becoming a healing ribbon through the city.”</p><p>To date, the Beltline has cleaned up more than 73 acres of contaminated former industrial land and created 470 acres of new green space, bringing shade, stormwater retention and safe recreation to neighborhoods that long lacked them.</p><h3>Learning from the Past</h3><p>The Beltline’s success has not come without cost. As neighborhoods grew more desirable, real estate prices went up, putting affordability pressures on longtime residents and small businesses — impacts not fully anticipated at the project’s start.</p><p>“Affordable housing was always a goal,” said Dennis Richards, vice president of housing policy and development for ABI. “But folks didn’t understand how to get there.”</p><p>In some areas, rapid appreciation fueled displacement, especially in historically Black communities. Acknowledging this, Atlanta sharpened its policy response, requiring affordable homes in new developments. To date, more than 6,300 affordable units have been created or preserved along the Beltline corridor. Organizations were also set up to help finance new homes and provide property tax relief to longtime residents.</p><p>Developments like Madison Reynoldstown, a 116-unit affordable apartment building along the Beltline’s Southeast Trail, serve as an example of what’s possible.</p><p>“With the affordable housing, they’re bringing people who built the community back into the community,” said community manager Najah Eskridge. “People who once had to move away can come back home.”</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Community Manager Najah Eskridge stands on the steps in front of the Madison Reynoldstown housing development.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-housing_0.jpg?VersionId=q_cC82dwIhYJpZAJro82QvKCHCbyTHnr&h=0a8b6f8b&itok=_yEjuBSh\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Najah Eskridge, community manager at Madison Reynoldstown, an affordable housing development along the Atlanta Beltline.

Guided by City Council Resolution 06-R-1576, the Beltline is required to hold quarterly briefings, host project-specific and neighborhood-based check-ins and provide regular public reporting. Residents serve on advisory bodies for housing, finance and implementation, ensuring community voices inform every major decision.</p><p>“We don’t chew gum without having a conversation with the community,” Higgs said.</p><p>This commitment goes beyond rhetoric. At Murphy Crossing, a 20-acre mixed-use redevelopment project along the Southwest Trail, ABI has built trust, accountability and partnership by working closely with community members since 2025 to co-create a vision for the site that reflects both local priorities and market realities.</p><p>This inclusive approach extends to the Beltline’s focus on shared prosperity. Through its land acquisition strategy and programs like the Atlanta Beltline Marketplace, a small business incubator, the project helps local entrepreneurs and women- and minority-owned businesses secure commercial space and remain rooted in their communities.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"644\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People stand among the colorful buildings in Atlanta Beltline's marketplace.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-marketplace_0.jpg?VersionId=bY5l1TGwQZV02lO9J65Cf5NWN7BjJ5.k&itok=vI5SzQJ8\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Customers eat and socialize outside Good As Burgers, a restaurant operating through the Atlanta Beltline Marketplace program.

Robey is the founder of Happy Black Parent, a small business offering programming for children and families, much of it outdoors.</p><p>“We have a minuscule marketing budget,” she said. “Being near the Beltline means people can find us just by being out here. That’s been crucial to keeping our business alive.”</p><p>That experience reflects a broader pattern the Beltline has enabled along the corridor.</p><p>“Businesses want to be on the Beltline because that’s where the people are,” said Natalie Jones, project manager for ABI’s Business Solutions Office.</p><p>The results are visible: More than 29,000 jobs are now located within a half mile of the corridor, reflecting how the Beltline has become an economic engine as well as a thriving civic space.</p><p>“You have no city without small businesses,” said Sarah Pierre, a Beltline resident and owner of 3 Parks Wine Shop, which has two locations along the trail. “The energy of the city is small businesses.”</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Sarah Pierre holds a wine bottle while speaking with a customer in her wine shot along the Atlanta Beltline.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-3parks-wine_0.jpg?VersionId=4RePBT9R3qMho90VINeCeKu3_6ENqiC3&h=ac778ff2&itok=DAIsg4fI\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Sarah Pierre, owner of 3 Parks Wine Shop, talks with customers inside her store along the Atlanta Beltline.

City leaders, planners and delegations from across the U.S. and around the world come to walk the trail, looking for lessons in how to reimagine neglected infrastructure, combat sprawl and build livable cities around people, not cars.</p><p>“The Beltline is a different way of growing,” said Jill Johnson, vice president of government affairs for ABI. “It was a project that came about when people of Atlanta spoke up and really latched onto the idea that we could grow differently, that barriers built up over decades could be knocked down.”</p><p>One reason the Beltline succeeded where others have stalled is its unique governance model. ABI was created in 2006 as a quasi-public agency whose sole mandate is to plan, coordinate and deliver the project. That dedicated structure and singular focus has given the Beltline the momentum and continuity that most city departments struggle to sustain.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People walk along the Atlanta Beltline, a pathway between trees, apartment homes and businesses.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-eastside.jpg?VersionId=wIaWGa.LToqGduDyUccqZ0Gp_.Z8O4N9&itok=wZC-sAcg\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>People walk along the Atlanta Beltline amid new development and restored green space. Photo by Erin Sintos.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>But even a strong organization needs secure, long-term funding. The Beltline’s financial engine combines a Tax Allocation District, which captures growth in property tax revenue to fund public improvements, with a Special Service District, a levy on commercial and multi-family properties established in 2021 that has generated over $100 million to help complete the trail by 2030. Together, these tools ensure steady investment insulated from elections, while requiring transparency and ongoing community buy-in.</p><p>As a result, more than $9 billion in private investment along the corridor is fueling new businesses, homes and public spaces.</p><p>Yet the Beltline’s spirit is measured not just in dollars, but in how the project brings people together. Arts and culture have animated the corridor from the start. The annual Atlanta Beltline Lantern Parade, which began as a grassroots art project, now attracts more than 70,000 people each year.</p><p>“We used to wonder if anyone would use the trail, if Atlantans would ever get out of their cars and go for a walk together,” said Chantelle Rytter, founder of the Lantern Parade and a Beltline resident. “That seems crazy now.”</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"At night, people hold up a large colorful illuminated lantern shaped like a bird with large wings.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/atlanta-beltline-lantern-parade-westside-trail.jpg?VersionId=C48ybytDAQ8y0PjUXDZXM3eSb4ww4u67&h=c6980913&itok=BcvqOP8_\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Participants carry illuminated lanterns during the Atlanta Beltline Lantern Parade, attended by tens of thousands each year.

Street-level rail transit — central to the original vision — still lies ahead, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/business/atlanta-beltline-success-displacement.html\">affordability challenges persist</a>. But the project’s durability, shaped by institutionalized community engagement, dedicated governance and secure funding, gives many Atlantans reason for optimism.</p><p>“Even in its unfinished condition,” Gravel said, “the Beltline gives people confidence that Atlanta is going to grow into the kind of place they want to be.”</p><p>For cities around the world, the lesson is not to copy the Beltline, but to emulate its values and approach.</p><p>“We tell cities all the time that you don’t have to mimic exactly what we did,” Higgs said. “But you should mimic our principles: being comprehensive in community development and making sure that every part of your community can see themselves in the project.”</p><p>Along a corridor that once divided Atlanta, these values are visible from morning to night — in the steady, hopeful rhythm of people moving through a city that is learning to grow better, together.</p><p><em>The Atlanta Beltline was selected as </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-wri-ross-center-prize-cities-names-five-finalists-transforming-health-and-daily-life\"><em>one of five finalists</em></a><em> for the </em><a href=\"https://prizeforcities.org/\"><em>2025-2026 WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities</em></a>, <em>which celebrates projects and initiatives catalyzing healthy cities.

      "description": "<p>AI tools like ChatGPT, navigation apps and streaming platforms feel effortless, drawing information seemingly from thin air. Yet the infrastructure behind them is anything but invisible.</p><p>Across the country, a surge of new data centers is reshaping local energy grids, water systems and land use. This rapid expansion is often happening with limited public information about the long-term impacts — or benefits — new data centers could bring.</p><p>Rising power bills and rampant water use tend to be top of mind. Yet it’s increasingly clear that data centers will have impacts far beyond this, with real implications for communities’ well-being.</p><p>While the rise in data centers is all but inevitable, the <em>way</em> it happens is not. Data centers power modern life and can bring both investment and jobs. Clear rules on energy procurement, water use, land siting, community engagement and cost recovery will determine whether this growth strengthens local economies and infrastructure — or shifts risks to residents.</p><h3>The US Data Center Boom</h3><p>Data centers are the physical infrastructure of the internet. They house the servers, networking equipment and supporting systems — such as cooling, power backup, fire suppression and security — that keep digital services running reliably.</p><p>Data centers first emerged in the mid-20th century and proliferated during the 1990s alongside the rise of the internet. But today’s expansion is unfolding at a much larger scale and faster pace than ever before. It’s fueled by billions of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\">private investment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.naiop.org/research-and-publications/magazine/2024/Winter-2024-2025/development-ownership/an-overview-of-state-data-center-related-tax-incentives/\">state tax incentives</a>, and federal directives aimed at <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\">fast-tracking permitting</a>. These policies are prioritizing large, AI-related facilities in a bid to strengthen <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\">U.S. competitiveness</a>.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27513048/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These facilities can take many forms, ranging from small server rooms inside of office buildings to massive, stand-alone <a>campuses</a> the size of hundreds of football fields. This last category, often known as “hyperscale” data centers, has drawn particular attention thanks to their size, rapid growth and substantial impacts on local communities.</p><p>There were just over <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/\">3,900</a> data centers across the United States as of late January<sup>1</sup> — nearly 37% of the world’s total.

These areas function as national hubs for cloud and AI infrastructure, hosting a disproportionate share of large-scale facilities relative to their size.</p><p>Virginia, often described as “<a href=\"https://www.governing.com/infrastructure/the-data-center-capital-of-the-world-is-in-virginia#:~:text=Northern%20Virginia%20is%20the%20world%27s%20top%20data,cable%20and%20energy%20infrastructure%20by%20America%20Online**\">the data center capital of the world</a>,” hosts the largest number of facilities, followed by Texas and California.

We examined seven ways this growth is reshaping local conditions ― and looked at emerging governance practices that can help manage trade-offs.</p><h4>1) Managing soaring energy demand</h4><p>As technology advances and computing demand grows, data centers are becoming <a>increasingly energy</a> hungry. A single modern AI data center can use as much power as <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/executive-summary\">100,000 homes</a>; many of the larger ones now being built are expected to consume up to 20 times that amount.</p><p>Estimates of total future power demand from data centers <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-data-centers-electricity-demand\">vary</a> significantly. One study from the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.71468/P1WC7Q\">Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> found that data centers could represent up to 12% of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. Another analysis, by <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies-National-Load-Growth-Report-2025.pdf\">Grid Strategies</a>, says that up to 90 gigawatts (GW) worth of data centers could come online by 2030. That’s about 9 times New York City’s peak summer demand joining the grid in less than five years.</p><p>This adds to concerns about rising power bills across the United States. 2025 saw <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/electric-and-natural-gas-utility-rate-hikes-tracker/\">over $60 billion</a> worth of rate increases countrywide, with Americans paying almost 10% more for electricity on average compared to 2024. The reasons for these rate hikes are complex and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=michelle+levinson+elecgricity+prices&oq=michelle+levinson+&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIAhBFGDsyCggAEEUYFhgeGDsyCwgBEOkHGPQHGM0IMgYIAhBFGDsyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyCAgGEAAYFhgeMggIBxAAGBYYHjIGCAgQRRg8MggICRDpBxjyBzIICAoQ6QcY8gcyCAgLEOkHGPIHMggIDBDpBxj8VdIBCDUxMzJqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">variable</a>. However, there’s evidence that the need to <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/data-centers-pjm-capacity-auction/808951/\">procure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-data-center-transmission-costs-ratepayers/761579/\">build</a> new energy infrastructure for data centers contributed to price increases in at least one region (the Mid-Atlantic). Other regions could see the same if safeguards aren’t put in place.</p><p>Many states and utilities are exploring ways to ensure that data centers can come online without shifting costs to other ratepayers. Last year, utility <a href=\"https://www.aep.com/news/stories/view/10327/\">AEP Ohio</a> introduced a new rate schedule for data centers requiring them to pay for at least 85% of the energy they are subscribed for, regardless of how much they actually use. Other states, like <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/06/05/oregon-data-centers-cryptocurrency-business-environment-power-electricity/\">Oregon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/94/2025/1/HF/16/versions/0/\">Minnesota</a> and <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/25info/bts_web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=66\">Missouri</a>, have required utilities to create new billing classes and rate structures for large energy users so that their costs aren’t shared by households and businesses.</p><h4>2) Protecting local water supplies</h4><p>Data centers require huge amounts of water to keep servers cool enough to function. Mid-sized facilities can use up to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119938708/data-centers-backbone-of-the-digital-economy-face-water-scarcity-and-climate-ris\">300,000 gallons</a> of water a day, while large facilities can consume as much as <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption\">5 million gallons</a> daily — comparable to what a small town uses. Recent <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2026/01/11/americas-ai-boom-is-running-into-an-unplanned-water-problem/\">estimates</a> project that by 2028, AI-related data centers in the U.S. could require up to 32 <em>billion</em> gallons of water annually. This is enough to support roughly 360,000 households’ indoor water use.</p><p>This massive demand is a pressing problem for communities already facing drought or depleting water supplies. <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ai-data-center-growth-deepens-water-security-concerns-in-high-stress-states-report/\">Two-thirds</a> of all data centers built or in development since 2022 are located in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-data-centers-are-deepening-the-water-crisis-2025-6\">water-stressed areas</a> like southern Arizona, the Colorado River Basin and Texas.</p><p>This has prompted public concern and <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/google-agrees-to-limit-groundwater-use-from-s-c-aquifer/\">governance action</a> in some communities. In <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/google-agrees-to-limit-groundwater-use-from-s-c-aquifer/\">South Carolina</a>, for example, residents near an overdrawn aquifer sought limits on data center ground water withdrawals. Others are asserting greater oversight through water-use monitoring, drought contingency planning, and site-specific water risk assessments that evaluate impacts on local water supplies. Some data centers are using cooling approaches that reduce water demand, such as traditional <a href=\"https://www.iceotope.com/learning-hub/insights/an-introduction-to-data-center-cooling/\">air cooling or liquid immersion</a>. Others are leveraging <a href=\"https://esgnews.com/aws-expands-recycled-water-use-to-over-120-data-centers-across-the-u-s/#:~:text=Recycled%20Water%20and%20Data%20Infrastructure,model%20of%20circular%20resource%20use.\">reclaimed wastewater</a> from utilities instead of drawing from local supplies.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1044\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"835\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"640\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"504\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"302\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A large data center under construction.\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/mesa-data-center_0.jpg?VersionId=tp6ubmpk58HEpjiuqIY_NFIvtayS.dpC&itok=gWlBQiV-\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Mesa Data Center near Phoenix, Ariz.

Many facilities rely on gas-fired generation for routine operations alongside diesel generators for emergency backup. Both come with climate and health risks.</p><p>Some data centers house gas power on-site for day-to-day operations, creating continuous air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most visible examples is unfolding in Memphis, Tennessee, where more than 30 natural gas turbines intended for daily use are being installed at xAI’s new Colossus data center. Local residents and the NAACP filed a notice with <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/naacp-launches-lawsuit-over-pollution-from-musks-xai/\">intent to sue</a> under the Clean Air Act, arguing that the project could <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/elon-musks-xai-facility-is-polluting-south-memphis/\">worsen already dangerous air quality </a>in a city that faces high asthma rates and longstanding environmental health disparities.</p><p>Diesel-fueled backup generators also release harmful air pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), linked to respiratory disease, heart disease, asthma and other serious health risks. Although these generators are <a href=\"https://www.sidley.com/en/insights/newsupdates/2025/05/us-epa-issues-new-guidance-on-data-center-emergency-generator-operations\">only used during emergencies</a>, they can have outsized health impacts, emitting <a href=\"https://www.aqmd.gov/home/permits/emergency-generators\">200 to 600 times</a> more nitrogen oxides than natural gas plants. One analysis in Virginia estimated that even limited backup generator use could already be associated with nearly <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2412.06288v2#A1.SS1\">$300 million in annual public health</a> costs and 14,000 asthma-related health impacts across multiple states.</p><p>Some facilities are beginning to adopt cleaner on-site power alternatives. <a href=\"https://dcpulse.com/article/battery-energy-storage-data-centers#:~:text=Most%20BESS%20use%20lithium%2Dion,no%20emissions%20when%20in%20use.\">Battery energy storage systems</a> can replace diesel generators during outages, avoiding their high pollution. Pairing hybrid <a href=\"https://www.7x24exchange.org/a-transformative-approach-to-bridging-the-data-center-power-gap/\">microgrids</a> with renewables is another alternative that supports community resilience without increasing emissions. Local and state officials can help by integrating clean power and emissions considerations into permitting and comprehensive planning; requiring companies to disclose on-site power strategies; and evaluating cleaner alternatives during permitting review.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Aerial view of a large data center campus with power generation on site.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/skybox-power-campus_0.jpg?VersionId=eqNI.P3t4tN8TKEJIn9JmiP5mMs_CMOp&h=ce783091&itok=4qQ74zBP\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Some data center campuses, like the Skybox Power Campus near Austin, Texas, are being built with power infrastructure onsite. Photo by Steve Heap/Shutterstock</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>4) Mitigating noise</h4><p>Data center construction, rooftop cooling systems and backup generators can be disruptively noisy. Smaller diesel generators reportedly <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Understanding-the-impact-of-data-center-noise-pollution#:~:text=Noise%20emission%20depends%20on%20the,Cooling%20systems\">reach 85 decibels</a>, levels that can harm hearing. Larger industrial units can approach 100 decibels — equivalent to a motorcycle or jackhammer.</p><p>This noise can last for hours or days at a time. Residents in Loudon County, Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/data-center-noise-disruptions-loudoun-county-virginia-2023-11?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=insider-Virginia-sub-post\">reported</a> disruptions in sleep, headaches and even lower quality of life because of a nearby data center, experiences that were echoed during a recent <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/the_data_center_next_door_the_hidden_costs_of_ai_and_crypto.pdf\">congressional roundtable</a>.</p><p>To address this, some data center developers and local governments are beginning to use measures such as natural acoustic <a href=\"https://future-bridge.us/noise-control-in-data-centers-key-design-strategies/\">barriers</a>, greater setbacks from homes and improved insulation for backup generators. Emerging technologies, including liquid cooling and improved airflow design, can also lower fan and HVAC noise. In places where <a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/data-centers\">zoning codes</a> include noise protections, local governments can use the permitting processes to require projected decibel levels, noise mitigation plans and ongoing monitoring commitments.</p><h4>5) Addressing competition for land</h4><p>Massive data centers are reshaping how land is used in many communities. In 2024, the <a href=\"https://cushwake.cld.bz/Data-Center-Development-Cost-Guide-2025/2-3/\">average data center site</a> covered about 224 acres or 0.35 square miles — roughly the size of 450 football fields. This represents a 144% increase since 2022. Developers are increasingly seeking large parcels for multi-building campuses that allow for phased construction and future expansion. Hyperscale facilities require even more land, with the largest campuses exceeding 1,000 acres, or about 1.6 square miles, according to a recent report from the <a href=\"https://wfbf.com/policy/current-issues/data-center-impacts-on-agriculture/\">Wisconsin Farm Bureau</a>.</p><p>This often intersects with agricultural and rural land uses. In Wisconsin, where about 50 data centers are located, <a href=\"https://www.wdtn.com/news/300-acres-of-farmland-could-be-rezoned-for-new-data-center-near-i-70/\">residents have concerns</a> that rezoning for data center development could accelerate the loss of productive farmland, which is already declining due to development pressures, land consolidation and competition. Similar tensions have surfaced across rural communities in Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.inkfreenews.com/2025/05/05/data-center-wave-stalls-as-indiana-communities-push-back/?ref=ambrook\">Indiana </a>and <a href=\"https://appvoices.org/2025/07/09/community-defeats-gas-plant-and-data-center-proposal/\">Virginia</a>. In Ohio, a proposal to rezone 300 acres of farmland to support data center development sparked such widespread opposition that the landowners ultimately <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/application-for-data-center-in-preble-county-ohio-withdrawn/\">withdrew their application</a>.</p><p>Some local governments are exploring policies to treat data centers as a distinct land use, steer development away from prime farmland and apply additional reviews to large-scale projects. These approaches can include strengthened agricultural zoning and implementing performance standards to address buffering, traffic, noise and long-term site management.</p><h4>6) Reducing pressure on marginalized communities</h4><p>Emerging analyses suggest that some data center siting patterns could compound long-standing environmental and economic challenges. A national <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/environmental-justice-us-data-centers-key-insights-equitable-kmetz-326vf/\">review </a>of roughly 700 data centers across the country found that nearly half are in census tracts with above-median environmental burdens, such as air pollution, park access and water pollution, as measured by the Center for Disease Control’s Environmental Justice Index. Many were located in areas with social vulnerability indicators, such as poverty and lower education levels.</p><p>State level assessments show similar concerns. In <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/data-center-boom-risks-health-of-already-vulnerable-communities/\">California</a>, existing and planned data centers appear more frequently in areas of high air pollution. In <a href=\"https://capitalbnews.org/ai-data-centers-south-carolina-black-communities/\">South Carolina</a>, new facilities and the fossil-fuel generation built to power them are often sited near Black and low-income communities.</p><p>More research is needed to fully understand these trends. Yet preliminary findings underscore the importance of ensuring that new data center development does not reinforce existing inequities.</p><p>Several practices can help communities and local governments navigate the trade-offs of data center siting. The <a href=\"https://naacp.org/resources/frontline-framework-community-guiding-principles\">NAACP’s Frontline Framework Community Guiding Principles</a>, offers practical strategies to ensure data centers are planned and built in ways that protect health and equity. In addition, <a href=\"https://naacp.org/sites/default/files/documents/NAACP%20CBA%20Template%202026.pdf\">NAACP's Community Benefits Agreement template</a> helps communities and decision-makers advance transparency, accountability and shared governance in data center development.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Construction of data center near a neighborhood.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/data-center-construction-georgia_0.jpg?VersionId=QGL1n5k2fKgQ3DBiomWc5H3DpdCKYVLh&itok=aWYpvGes\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Construction of a data center near homes in Atlanta, Ga. Developers and governments need to plan data centers with care to ensure they do not put pressure on communities, especially those already facing environmental and social disparities.

Their construction generates hundreds of well-paying — though temporary — jobs for technicians, electricians and other local building trade workers. There are also good-paying opportunities for full-time staff, like technicians, security staff and facility managers. At Google’s data center in central Ohio, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-promised-jobs-cities-160333397.html\">salaries range from</a> about $74,000 for a data center technician to more than $160,000 for an operations manager. Yet these positions are fairly limited. A <a href=\"https://goodjobsfirst.org/big-tech-promised-jobs-cities-gave-millions-where-are-the-workers/\">review</a> of more than 1,200 U.S. data centers found that even the largest employ fewer than 150 permanent workers, and sometimes as few as 25.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Summary of Governance Tools to Mitigate Data Center Impacts on Communities</strong></p><p><strong>Energy</strong></p><ul><li>Dedicated rate classes for large energy users.</li><li>Cost-recovery safeguards.</li></ul><p><strong>Water Protection</strong></p><ul><li>Water-use monitoring and public disclosure.</li><li>Drought contingency planning.</li><li>Reclaimed wastewater use.</li></ul><p><strong>Air</strong></p><ul><li>Replacing diesel with battery storage.</li><li>Emissions review during permitting.</li><li>On-site clean power requirements.</li></ul><p><strong>Land-Use Planning</strong></p><ul><li>Agricultural zoning protections.</li><li>Performance standards for noise, traffic and buffering.</li></ul><p><strong>Equity and Community Voice</strong></p><ul><li>Community benefits agreements.</li><li>Transparent siting criteria.</li><li>Limiting use of NDAs.</li><li>Public disclosure of resource demands.</li></ul></div><p>Data centers also generate revenue for local or state governments through property, sales and use taxes. A recent <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63a4849eab1c756a1d3e97b1/t/67b38f78e9cf125daf756112/1739820925392/Data+Center+Economic+Contribution+Study+2025_Final.pdf\">national</a> estimate found that total government revenues associated with the data center sector increased from $66 billion in 2017 to more than $162 billion in 2023. However, many states and cities offer sizable tax incentives to attract data centers, meaning the actual gain can be far smaller than projected.</p><p>These benefits must be weighed against long-term public costs, including investments in water systems, electrical substations, transmission lines, roads and emergency services. Water and electric infrastructure often remains in place for around 30 years. If a data center downsizes or relocates before these costs are recovered, communities may be left paying for infrastructure sized for a facility that no longer exists.</p><p>Communities and local governments can call for stronger financial analysis, clear rules for cost recovery, and more transparency about infrastructure demands to help ensure that both host communities and companies see economic benefits from new data centers.</p><h3>Done Right, Data Centers Don’t Have to Be Harmful</h3><p>As data centers proliferate, local concerns are mounting. More than $64 billion in projects were delayed or canceled between May 2024 and March 2025 due to organized <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\">opposition</a>.</p><p>Threats to communities are not an inevitable outcome of data center development; they’re the result of decisions made by developers, local governments and other stakeholders. Yet even as community involvement grows, major governance gaps persist.</p><p>Many developers enter non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with local officials, which can limit public access to information about project scale, resource needs and potential impacts. A <a href=\"https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/30/data-centers-non-disclosure-agreements-and-democracy/\">review</a> of 31 Virginia municipalities with existing or proposed data centers found that 25 (80%) had NDAs in place. At the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/\">federal level</a>, new permitting policies have accelerated approvals for large data center projects, shortening environmental review timelines and reducing opportunities for local input.</p><p>In response, some local governments are beginning to develop stronger tools to support negotiations with developers. Some local governments, like <a href=\"https://www.wosu.org/politics-government/2025-09-09/jerome-township-puts-pause-on-new-data-center-development-for-nine-months\">Jerome Township</a>, Ohio, have imposed temporary moratoria, pausing approvals for new data centers to reassess siting criteria and community safeguards. Prince George’s County, Md., created a <a href=\"https://pgccouncil.us/DocumentCenter/View/12947/Council-Resolution-16-2025\">data center task force</a> to study siting criteria and procedural protections. In Lancaster, Pa., city leaders approved a <a href=\"https://ecode360.com/LA1674/document/753204358.pdf\">community benefits agreement</a> which directs the developer to use clean energy to power the facility; mitigate noise; support local employment programs; and deliver $10 million each for economic development and advancing Lancaster climate and community goals.</p><p>Together, these efforts reflect an emerging understanding: <strong>How data centers are governed will determine whether communities benefit from the digital economy — or bear the brunt of its risks.</strong> Ultimately, whether data centers deliver shared prosperity or reinforce existing inequities will hinge on policies and processes that fully include community priorities alongside government and developer decision-making.</p><p><em>Research support for this article was provided by Jada Turner, a Park Scholar and Honors student at North Carolina State University.</em></p><p> </p><p><sup>1 Total U.S. data center count as of Jan. 21, 2026.

      "description": "<p>Emissions from land used to grow crops for food, animal feed, fiber, fuel and more, known as croplands, are often overlooked. But they are far from insignificant. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-026-02558-4\">New maps of crop emissions</a> from a global collaboration of universities and international research institutions, led by Cornell University and <a href=\"https://landcarbonlab.org/\">Land & Carbon Lab</a>, reveal that in 2020 alone, croplands emitted nearly 5% of global net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by human activity. That may sound small, but these emissions surpass those from <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modernizing-ports-major-untapped-opportunity-healthier-planet\">global shipping</a> and are on par with annual GHG emissions from <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">tropical primary forest loss</a>.</p><p>Just four crops — rice, maize (corn), wheat and oil palm — account for the majority (67%) of these emissions, even though hundreds of crops are grown worldwide. Emissions from these top-emitting crops come from the large areas of land they occupy and the way that land is managed, including the use of fertilizers, manure, burning leftover crops, and other cultivation techniques.</p><p>Clearly, these crops are essential to nourish a rising global population —  projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.unonline.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">nearly 10 billion people by 2050</a> —  as well as for the rapid increase in animal feed demand and for creating industrial products used in our everyday lives. At the same time, there is an opportunity to shape a more climate-smart, resource-efficient global food system, where farming plays a more significant role in addressing climate change.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A man rides a plow on farmland surrounded by white birds.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/rice-farmer-plow-sri-lanka_0.jpg?VersionId=12Pg0d7r06ZDeVi_Ou3AVp3WeTVrXMef&h=b2d9f031&itok=K06wYsKj\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>After harvest on a Sri Lanka rice field, a man plows the field. Farming practices, like plowing leftover crops back into soil can release climate-harming emissions.

When these soils dry out, the presence of oxygen triggers microbial activity that breaks down the organic matter, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide. In contrast, flooded rice fields release methane because waterlogged soils lack oxygen, creating ideal conditions for methane-producing microbes to break down organic matter.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Degraded peatlands after they've been cleared for agricultural production.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/degraded-peatlands-clearing_0.jpg?VersionId=lLQyXqUrC3UyYJQrjnn2nvZMT5E2u4Fg&itok=AcobW9kg\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>As peatlands are cleared and drained for agricultural production, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide.

Two farmers growing the same crop in the same region can have different emission footprints simply because they make different choices about fertilizer, water and soil management. This variation shows that one-size-fits-all climate solutions are unlikely to be effective. Instead, reducing emissions from agriculture requires targeted, context-specific approaches that reflect local crops, conditions and farming practices.</p><div class=\"callout aligncenter\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Data: A Clearer Map for Climate-Smart Agriculture</strong></p><p>To map global cropland emissions, a consortium of leading research institutions led by Cornell University along with Colorado State University, University of Minnesota, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and others combined a wide range of ground-based and modeled data sources to harmonize crop and livestock production systems.</p><p>Croplands are defined according to FAO as land used to grow temporary (crops with a growing cycle of less than one year that need to be replanted after harvest) and permanent (long-lived) crops and exclude temporary grazing lands and fallow lands (previously cropped fields left unseeded for one or more seasons to let the soil recover).</p><p>To map which crops are grown where, how much is harvested and how many calories are produced, the team used the <a href=\"https://www.mapspam.info/\">Spatial Production Allocation Model</a>. Then, they layered in spatially detailed information about how crops are typically managed, drawing from FAO, national reports and scientific literature.</p><p>Peatland extent was defined using a hybrid map adjusted to align with cropland totals on drained peatlands as reported in the <a href=\"https://globalpeatlands.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/peatland_assessment.pdf\">Global Peatland Assessment</a>. Then, emissions were mapped using methods from <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html\">IPCC’s 2019 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</a>.</p><p>Note that maps of crop emissions do not account for changes in agricultural soil carbon beyond carbon dioxide emissions from crops growing on drained peatlands. The maps also exclude carbon dioxide temporarily stored and released from the crops themselves.</p></div><h3>The 4 Crops Driving 67% of Emissions</h3><p>The biggest opportunity for cutting emissions lies in focusing on how rice, maize, wheat and oil palm are grown. These crops are essential to feed and nourish the world, yet it will be just as essential to rethink how these crops are grown to cut climate pollution and ensure farmers can still earn a living.</p><p>Rice accounts for 43% of all cropland emissions globally. This is due primarily to methane emissions from flooded rice fields, a process central to traditional rice farming in much of Asia.</p><p>Maize and wheat, though less emissions-intensive than rice per hectare, cover vast areas of the globe and rely heavily on nitrogen fertilizers to grow quickly and sustain high yields, leading to high total nitrous oxide emissions.</p><p>Oil palm, though planted on just 2% of cropland, packs a huge climate punch because it’s often grown on carbon-rich peatlands in Southeast Asia.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26907727/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>6 Countries Account for 61% of all Crop Emissions</h3><p>The six highest-emitting countries — China, Indonesia, India, United States, Thailand and Brazil — together account for 61% of global crop emissions.

Indonesia stands out for its high emissions from planting crops on drained peatlands</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26905117/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Where different crops are grown around the world today often reflect more than just climate or soil conditions — it’s also the result of deep-rooted historical legacies. Colonial trade routes, government subsidies, dietary preferences and infrastructure investments have all shaped agricultural landscapes over time. For example, oil palm dominates parts of Southeast Asia not only because it grows well there, but also due to decades of <a href=\"https://www.un-redd.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/INDONESIA%20FISCAL%20POLICIES%20OIL%20PALM%20V6%20WEB.pdf\">government incentives</a>, <a href=\"https://gfw.global/xHJbi7\">processing infrastructure</a> and <a href=\"https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Indonesia_Palm_Oil_Fact_Sheet_20190130.pdf\">export demand</a>. Likewise, wheat and maize that grow in temperate countries reflects <a href=\"https://aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/World-Agricultural-Crop-Production-over-the-Past-Six-Decades.pdf\">public and private investment</a> in breeding higher-yielding seeds, expanding <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2024-05-20_R48071_c6388b51e55f3414934d8f621905bd952ed19937.pdf\">rural extension programs</a> and building <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/corn-is-everywhere/\">commodity markets</a> and trade networks. These patterns persist, even when more climate-smart or resource-efficient alternatives may be available. Understanding these legacies is key to recognizing both the constraints and opportunities for shifting to lower emission, more sustainable cropping systems.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Smoke from burning crop residues in agricultural farmland lifts into the air.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/burning-crop-residues_0.jpg?VersionId=pyu03GM4gCAsI0GE403Z_UvHdYjgCTTh&h=5a62e6c6&itok=DcmpY_fy\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The practice of burning crop residues after harvest releases harmful climate emissions including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide into the air.

Here, calories refer to the energy contained in harvested crops, a standard way to compare very different crops on equal footing, whether they’re used for food, animal feed, biofuels or other products. Together, these metrics help us understand not just how much we are emitting, but also how many emissions arise per unit of energy contained in those crops. It’s a bit like looking at how much pollution your car produces overall and how much it emits for every mile you drive. Just as understanding fuel efficiency helps set smarter standards for cars and trucks, this level of detail helps design smarter, more targeted climate solutions for agriculture.   </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26902867/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>High emissions don’t always mean a system is inefficient. Some of the most productive farming regions in the world also have the highest emissions. Asia, for example, has the highest emissions per hectare of cropland, but also produces a large share of the world’s calories. Regions like Sub-Saharan Africa have much lower emissions per hectare, mainly because farmers use fewer fertilizers and other inputs and get lower yields. Each hectare emits less, but it also produces fewer calories. As a result, emissions per hectare look small, yet emissions per calorie aren’t proportionally low, since more land is needed to produce the same amount of food. The same pattern shows up when evaluating individual crops: Rice produces nearly half of all crop emissions globally but also delivers 28% of Asia’s calories. Oil palm, another top emitter, is also one of the most land-efficient crops in terms of calorie production.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26903653/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>This points to a core challenge in climate-smart agriculture: High emitting regions are often critical to food security. That doesn’t mean high emissions are justified, but it does mean that simply targeting the biggest emitters and setting blanket emission reduction targets could backfire. Instead, efforts should focus on reducing emissions per unit of crop calorie produced, getting the same (or more) output from each hectare while generating fewer emissions.</p><h3>Emissions Are Increasing in Key Crop-Producing Regions</h3><p>Emissions from crop production are not static — they are shaped by decades of decisions about where and how we grow food for human consumption, feed for livestock, fiber for industrial materials and biofuel for energy. Understanding these patterns is essential for designing effective, region-specific strategies to mitigate emissions.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2020, crop production increased 50% globally, corresponding to a 17% increase in emissions from croplands across major agricultural zones, especially in parts of Asia and South America. These changes reflect a combination of factors, including rising demand as well as shifts in how and where crops are cultivated — such as expanding crops into new areas, more intensive use of fertilizer and changing crop choices over time.</p><p>Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer and manure application together increased by 35%, with prominent increases in southern China, India, Indonesia and southern Brazil driven by intensified fertilizer use, increasing cropping intensity and the expansion of fertilizer-dependent crops into new areas.</p><p>Methane emissions from rice paddies remained relatively stable overall, but with regional shifts of declining emissions in some areas offset by increasing emissions in others, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. Emissions from crops planted on drained peatlands increased slightly in Southeast Asia, reflecting continued expansion of drainage infrastructure for cultivation of crops like oil palm. However, trends in other regions remain uncertain due to large differences in peatland and drained peatland estimates across datasets.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3576417/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>How to Feed a Growing Population While Reducing Emissions</h3><p>The issue boils down to one key question: How do we feed a projected 10 billion people by 2050 without driving up emissions?</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Using Research for Climate-Smart Food Systems</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">A full accounting of a company’s contribution to global land pressure includes metrics such as land use change emissions and land occupation (i.e., the amount of the land required to produce a crop). By combining Land & Carbon Lab’s spatially explicit data on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/companies-can-address-land-use-change-emissions-meet-climate-goals\">land use change emissions</a> and land occupation with these new maps of crop management emissions — with spatially detailed <a href=\"https://landcarbonlab.org/data/land-based-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sequestration/\">livestock emissions maps</a> coming later in 2026 — policymakers, producers and supply chain actors gain a far more complete and detailed picture of agriculture’s climate footprint. This integrated view enables more targeted, effective interventions to build a climate-smart, resource-efficient global food system that would simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and the pressure on the land itself.</p></div><p>This shouldn’t be a trade-off with climate action. The challenge is navigating the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore\">land squeeze</a>, where food production, industrial resources, biodiversity and carbon storage all compete for the same amount of land. The broad solution is to protect natural ecosystems, produce more food on existing agricultural land, reduce emissions and restore degraded land.</p><p>Simply swapping out high-emitting crops like rice isn’t the answer. Staple crops are deeply rooted in cultural, culinary, and agricultural traditions that can’t and shouldn’t be easily replaced; longstanding rice farming systems have sustained food security and livelihoods for centuries. Instead, the solution lies in <em>how </em>we grow crops.</p><p>Major sources of emissions from lands used to grow crops each need tailored strategies that farmers can implement, in some cases supported by incentives or pressures from governments and companies:</p><ul><li>For rice, climate impacts can be slashed through smarter water and residue management, like switching from constant flooding to alternate wetting and drying. Instead of burning or tilling leftover rice stalks, they can be used as animal bedding or feed or be composted after harvest. These methods can cut methane emissions nearly in half. However, adoption challenges may persist, like demand for human labor needed to weed intermittently flooded paddies and manually remove straw where mechanization is limited.</li><li>Fertilizer-related emissions can be lowered using the “4R” <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01076-w\">approach</a>, which refers to applying the right fertilizer source, at the right rate, at the right time, and in the right place. This means matching fertilizer type to crop needs (e.g., slow-release vs. fast-acting), avoiding over-application, timing application to when crops can actually absorb nutrients — typically during early to mid-growth stages when plants are rapidly growing — and placing fertilizer close to roots instead of broadcasting it across the field to improve uptake. These practices reduce the amount of excess nitrogen left in the soil, which microbes would otherwise convert into nitrous oxide emissions. Field trials show that good 4R management can cut nitrous oxide emissions by 20% to 50%.</li><li>For crops cultivated on peatlands, raising the water table even partway can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions. Rewetting peatlands — even partially — keeps more carbon in the ground by slowing decomposition without necessarily halting crop production.</li></ul><p>The future of agriculture will depend on how quickly we align past agricultural land use legacies with today’s planetary constraints.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>February 12, 2026 (Washington, DC)</strong> — Today the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a rule that will make it harder for EPA and future administrations to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Greenhouse gas emissions result from extracting and burning fossil fuels and contribute to a warming planet and dangerous impacts of climate change.</p><p>This new rule overturns the agency’s own scientific finding established after years of scientific and economic analysis, which concluded that greenhouse gas pollution endangers human health, thus requiring regulation and oversight to protect people and the environment.</p><p>In addition, EPA repealed greenhouse gas emissions standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles.<br /><br /><strong>Following is a statement from World Resources Institute (WRI) U.S. Director David Widawsky:</strong></p><p>“Every person and business in America should be alarmed that the U.S. government is walking away from its responsibility to protect their health and their wallets.</p><p>“Most people have never heard of this safeguard — the “endangerment” finding — but repealing it sends a clear message: this government doesn’t care. It doesn’t care that hotter summers are driving up energy bills and sending people to emergency rooms. It doesn’t care that extreme weather is raising homeowner insurance, pricing families out of mortgages and homes. It doesn’t care that many businesses will now no longer be protected from lawsuits over climate effects. It doesn’t care that farmers are losing crops and livestock, raising the price of groceries. The bottom line is that repealing these protections will make everyday life more expensive, more risky and more uncertain for Americans.</p><p>“EPA’s own settled science shows that managing greenhouse gases is fundamental to protecting Americans. Rolling back these safeguards is a dangerous breach of responsibility to protect people, the environment, and our economy, benefitting polluters at the expense of all people.”</p>",

As the world warms, there is an urgent need for a multitude of workers to shore up the resilience of our crops and fisheries, revive biodiversity hotspots, and restore our terrestrial and wetland ecosystems. Similarly, there is growing demand for technicians to retrofit our buildings into energy-efficient shields against extreme heat and other climate threats.</p><p>Like any great economic shift, some sectors will benefit more than others. Agriculture and land use could be one of the largest sources of employment, with regenerative agriculture and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\">nature-based solutions</a> generating 195 million new jobs — equivalent to about 17% of the sector’s current workforce. Construction could see the largest percentage growth, adding 175 million jobs. That’s roughly 70% of today’s construction workforce. </p><p>This is a significant opportunity — but one that’s not guaranteed. </p><p>Securing hundreds of millions of good jobs requires governments and businesses to invest now in workforce development. This means equipping workers with the skills they need to install wind turbines and solar panels, retrofit buildings to reduce energy use, shift from conventional to sustainable farming, and more. It means re-skilling people whose jobs may disappear, such as fossil fuel workers, while creating new opportunities for the labor force of the future. It means developing entrepreneurship to enable job growth. And it means righting some of the wrongs of the past, like expanding roles for women and others historically boxed out of job markets.</p><p>Prioritizing people and their livelihoods can deliver so much more than job growth — it makes the transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy politically durable. If we get this transition right, it can ultimately create stronger economies, improve social cohesion as well as curb climate change.</p><p>While the low-carbon transition is likely to generate net job gains, it will involve substantial job churn. A total of 630 million workers will potentially be affected by job transitions. This is particularly evident in the energy space. While the sector will ultimately add 20 million jobs in electrification, renewable energy development, and power grid expansion, there will be less demand for jobs focused on fossil fuel extraction. </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive-diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27296283/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>That’s why investing in workforce development and re-skilling is so essential. Opportunities and risks will need to be managed as jobs will be gained and lost across sectors and geographies. The transition can’t leave anyone behind — and with the promise of so many new jobs, it doesn’t have to. </p><p>But countries that potentially have the most to gain in terms of job creation are also the least equipped to seize the opportunity due to their labor market structure and lack of skills readiness and social protection measures. This includes many low-income countries in Africa.</p><p>Against this backdrop, closing the widening skills gaps in foundational, technical and transversal skills must become a much greater priority. The scale of the challenge is staggering: More than 760 million adults aged 15 and older do not possess basic numeracy and literacy skills; meanwhile, and 70% of children in low or middle-income countries cannot read by age 10. And while data on skills are relatively weak, estimates show that nearly three-quarters of youth aged 15-24 are off track in acquiring employment-relevant skills. </p><p>While these foundational skills are lagging, demand for green skills grew at a rate of 12% from 2023 to 2024 — twice the rate of supply. </p><p>Unless we take action to prepare now, the world will be hurtling toward a massive \"talent crunch\" that threatens to hold the global economy back and put a safe and sustainable future out of reach. </p><p>For example, a projected 14% shortfall in the number of renewable energy workers needed by 2030 could significantly slow the deployment of low-carbon technologies and delay emissions reductions. Over time, such delays would translate into higher cumulative emissions and increase the risk of additional warming, estimated at up to 0.7 degrees C. Every tenth of a degree of warming matters, increasing the risk of floods, droughts, wildfires and other dangerous impacts.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People restore mangroves in Indonesia\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/mangrove-restoration-project_0.jpg?VersionId=DVrNtm6tihDXVWKYoodJCM.6x24wMbbH&itok=mSIVt078\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Restoring mangrove trees in Tangerang, Indonesia. Research shows that building resilience to the impacts of climate change can create hundreds of millions of jobs.

They’ll need to improve labor market data and analysis and mobilize a better funded and more integrated policy response. This isn’t yet happening widely. Only half of countries’ <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">national climate plans, or “NDCs,”</a> reference workforce development strategies; only 1% offer concrete means of financing them. Corporate strategies are similarly scant on green skill-building.</p><p>The Philippines offers a model for others to follow. The country made green jobs a legislative priority, enshrined in policies like the Green Jobs Act, the Philippine Development Plan and the Labor and Employment Plan. It has also brought federal agencies together through the Inter-agency Committee on Green Jobs, led by the Department of Labor, to align education, environment, trade and finance around a shared goal: prioritizing green workforce development and skill-building.  This is the sort of coordinated planning and policymaking that can integrate low-carbon jobs across all parts of the economy.</p><p><strong>Innovation </strong>is also key. Governments and businesses need to test, identify and scale a new generation of workforce development programs that are fit for purpose, flexible and modular, often working with delivery and implementation partners to translate policy objectives into effective programs. This should include building smart accreditation and job matching platforms that offer pathways to jobs and livelihoods. Programs should prepare people for new and emerging low-carbon, climate-resilient jobs, as well as re-skill existing workers whose jobs are evolving. They should also include those typically left out of workforce development programs, like informal workers, women and rural communities.</p><p>In Pakistan, energy utility company K-Electric’s Roshni Baji program is one example of innovative workforce development. The program helps women from low-income areas become certified electricians, a historically male-dominated field. Alongside technical skills, women receive education in motorbike riding, self-defense, communication and stress management. It has already trained 200 women with electrical skills that are easily transferable to solar installation, microgrid maintenance, energy audits and other activities essential for greening the energy system. This is the type of innovation that can ensure the low-carbon transition benefits everyone.</p><p>And finally, none of this will happen without sustained <strong>investment. </strong>Workforce development and education are chronically underfunded, often treated as an expense rather than a high-return investment. Lower-income countries spend less than 0.1% of GDP on labor market programs. While high-income countries spend more, the percentage share has been declining over the past 2 decades. Governments and corporations alike must work together to align fiscal policy with employment goals and create the right incentives for businesses to invest in the capabilities of their workers. There’s a role for financial institutions like the multilateral development banks, too, in embedding workforce investments into climate and development finance.</p><p>Kenya’s plans show promise in this area. The country’s draft Green Fiscal Incentives Policy Framework seeks to mobilize private investments for a low-emissions, resilient economy — particularly in agriculture, which supports nearly 25% of Kenya’s GDP and is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The framework proposes tools to attract and de-risk private finance. They include: a Green Investment Bank and Credit Guarantee Scheme to unlock loans for agribusinesses and green small- and medium-sized enterprises; a Green Bonds framework to channel capital market investments; and capacity-building to equip the workforce with relevant green skills. If effectively implemented, these mechanisms could stimulate job creation across sustainable farming, renewable energy for irrigation, and agricultural processing — sectors that are vital for both climate resilience and rural employment. This is the type of finance that can create multiple benefits at once.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Maintenance workers service a giant wind turbine\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/wind-turbine-maintenance_0.jpg?VersionId=u9peczomrlUxKFS7qLgsRbweWqBzjDDj&itok=igkKfJig\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Maintenance workers service a giant wind turbine.

And if we seize this enormous opportunity, we can also deliver well-paid jobs, stronger local economies, and a more secure future for workers and their communities.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Twenty years ago, the forested slopes above Alpine Acres — a small community at the source of the Weber River in Summit County, Utah — were overgrown with dry brush and primed for wildfire. With only one road in and out, residents feared their community could be engulfed by the next catastrophic blaze — the same deadly trap people found themselves in during the <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.2252.pdf\">Paradise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/nist-updates-critical-wildfire-evacuation-and-sheltering-guidance\">Lahaina</a> wildfires.</p><p>But today, the landscape looks markedly different.  </p><p>The dense stands of trees and bushes have been replaced by a more open forest with meadows and cleared strips of land, known as fuel breaks, designed to slow or stop wildfires. By removing excess vegetation that serves as fuel for fire along the access road and around private properties, state officials have improved evacuation safety and reduced the risk of homes burning.  </p><p>“We’re one of the very first <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/firewise-usa\">Firewise</a> communities in the state of Utah,” said Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres. “Firewise means you’re aware of how fire could start on your property and in the whole community. When we first built houses up here, people weren’t thinking about that and some even had wooden shingle roofs. But gradually, people started to change how they build and maintain their land.” </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres, speaks in front of an aspen grove on his property.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/jim-w-in-alpine-acres.JPG?VersionId=.jc9tKvMQAo42qxHekBWrLkxvj5L_cwf&itok=MWSTWL7I\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Jim Warburton, a longtime resident of Alpine Acres, speaks in front of an aspen grove on his property.

Crucially, this sort of work can happen faster and on a greater scale than before thanks to a new funding model, the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/project/the-utah-resilience-fund/\">Utah Resilience Fund</a> (URF). Invented and deployed by a coalition of partners including Summit County, World Resources Institute, the U.S. Forest Service and others, the fund is reshaping how Utah manages wildfire risk and water security.</p><h3>A Fund to Address Catastrophic Wildfire Risk at Scale </h3><p>For decades, wildfire funding in the U.S. has typically been reactive, mobilizing resources only after fires ignite. In Utah alone, fire suppression <a href=\"https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2024/08/23/utah-spend-almost-12-million-fighting-wildfires/\">topped $28 million in 2024</a> with the state shouldering about a quarter of that cost. Yet states could actually <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800924001411\">save money in the long run</a> by investing upfront in forest restoration. This investment can avoid the devastating economic and human toll of catastrophic fires while also creating more jobs, recreation and water security.  </p><p>That’s where the Utah Resilience Fund comes in. Founded in 2020, it brings together public, private and philanthropic partners to take proactive steps, before disaster strikes. So far, the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/story/utah-resilience-fund/\">URF has raised more than $8.4 million</a> for faster, more flexible funding for restoration on both public and private lands, ensuring forest and watershed health treatments complement each other across boundaries. Beyond meeting urgent short-term needs, it also sets some funds aside in an <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0131.html\">income-generating endowment</a> to help sustain this work over the long term.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"823\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"658\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"504\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"397\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"238\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The Utah Resilience Fund Model\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/the-utah-resilience-fund-model.png?VersionId=PXl.JBcyL3H5DitG4.DrHqjHexvVBAX6&itok=DgsAEKAf\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>“The way we look at it now is to get ahead of the potential wildfire that we know is coming,” said Dano Jauregui, district ranger for the Heber-Kamas Ranger District of the U.S. Forest Service. “It costs far less to prepare the landscape upfront than to try to control or suppress a large fire later.” </p><h3>From the Weber Headwaters to the Great Salt Lake </h3><p>Improved wildfire resilience does not just protect homes from flames. It also safeguards Utah’s most precious resource — water. Catastrophic wildfire can send ash, sediment and chemical contaminants into the reservoirs, reducing storage capacity and threatening drinking water supplies. Overly dense and fire-prone forests can also draw down groundwater levels, leading to reduced water availability. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The upper Weber River flows through the community of Alpine Acres.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/upper-weber-river.JPG?VersionId=HvozpJTn31nLggpV8qH9iLtyzRpLaKxV&h=b39c5fef&itok=J22AH7Nl\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The upper Weber River flows through the community of Alpine Acres.

Decades of <a href=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/\">fire suppression</a> (putting out fires immediately), combined with <a href=\"https://naturalresources.utah.gov/dnr-newsfeed/drought-in-utah-more-than-a-water-supply-issue/\">higher temperatures and prolonged drought</a>, have disrupted this natural cycle. Forests are now overgrown with dense vegetation and dead trees, creating fuel for high-intensity wildfire. These types of wildfires <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2006/11/23/hayman-fire-still-mucking-up-water/\">scorch and damage soil</a>, send sediment downstream and ultimately degrade water quality.</p><p>To restore balance, land managers use forest thinning (selectively removing smaller and unhealthy trees), prescribed burns (carefully applying fire to a landscape), and other techniques to reduce accumulated fuel, lower wildfire risk and protect the watersheds that provide clean water downstream. Innovative financial mechanisms such as the Utah Resilience Fund and the <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/project/forest-resilience-bond/\">Forest Resilience Bond</a> help to pay for this work upfront, enabling faster, larger-scale restoration.   </p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-Utah-Forest-Management.pdf\">Forest Management FAQ</a> and <a href=\"https://cities4forests.com/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-Utah-Resilience-Fund.pdf\">URF FAQ</a>.</p></div><p>This is especially true in Utah, <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8476/\">the second driest state in the country</a>, where many forested headwaters lie in high wildfire risk zones. A core area where the URF is accelerating wildfire risk reduction is across the Weber River watershed. Originating in the snow-fed headwaters of the Uinta Mountains, the Weber flows through a mosaic of public and private lands, before draining into the Great Salt Lake, a region of immense economic and ecological importance.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\">A <strong>watershed</strong> (also called a drainage basin or catchment) is an area of land where rain and snowmelt flow from higher ground to join into streams and rivers, and eventually drain into a larger water body, such as a reservoir or ocean. </p></div><p>The river provides drinking water to over 700,000 Utahns in Summit, Morgan, Weber and Davis counties through the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (WBWCD), the primary water supplier for much of northern Utah.

Over the next decade, the USFS plans to treat 14,000 acres in the upper Weber watershed. This work will include creating a network of fuel breaks and thinning projects to reduce fire intensity and improve ecological health.</p><p>But treating federal lands alone isn’t enough. Fire doesn’t respect administrative boundaries, and real wildfire risk reduction requires cross boundary treatments that include restoring the surrounding private lands. The URF helps make this possible through funding adjacent fuel reduction projects in communities such as Alpine Acres, and further downstream, the <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4adda37668974b6b8eae31e90707ecfb\">910 Ranch</a>.  </p><p>Once a working sheep ranch established in the late 1800s, this 8,500-acre property straddles the source of East Canyon Creek, a key tributary of the Weber River, and is one of the last contiguous mountain ranches in the Park City area. Through the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/private-land/forest-legacy\">Forest Legacy Program</a>, a federal grant program to protect lands from development, Summit County and partners recently <a href=\"https://www.parkrecord.com/2026/01/27/summit-county-has-officially-closed-on-the-910-cattle-ranch/\">secured the land’s permanent protection</a>. This ensures this tract of land will continue to preserve the forests and meadows that safeguard water supplies. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The historic Jeremy cabin sits on the 910 Cattle Ranch in front of rolling hills.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2026-02/the-historic-jeremy-cabin.JPG?VersionId=Jq0BAh6NDglMqYEduL1AZGA9VjTNF0Mp&h=0d27ee61&itok=vsiPfFjJ\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The historic Jeremy cabin sits on the 910 Cattle Ranch in front of rolling hills.

In forested areas, crews have thinned dense conifer stands across 73 acres to reduce fuel loads and create a mosaic of openings that function as natural fire breaks. All these piles of conifers will be burned this winter, and debris along road corridors has already been chipped to improve safe access for emergency personnel.   </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"886\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"709\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"543\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Stacked piles of trees and brush\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2026-02/stacked-piles-of-trees-and-brush.JPG?VersionId=LztTDJGpJTNcM1PLPWnmDlwNLEn8nTLo&itok=Au--1NVY\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Stacked piles of trees and brush that have been thinned during a fuel reduction project on 910 Ranch to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health.

In the valley of the 910 Ranch, additional work is restoring the riverbanks to improve fish habitat and downstream water quality. “We’ve started replanting vegetation along East Canyon Creek, building cattle exclusion fences and putting in beaver dam analogs to restore the natural water flow and rebuild the streambanks,” said Kirby.  </p><p>Partners such as Trout Unlimited and local volunteers, with funding from Summit County and the Caterpillar Foundation, have planted <a href=\"https://ut-summitcounty.civicplus.com/2507/Outreach-Engagement\">over 700 willows</a> and dozens of cottonwood trees. This has helped stabilize eroding banks and provide shade for stretches of East Canyon Creek that had been grazed for more than a century. The team is also testing the reintroduction of <a href=\"https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/why-beaver-dam-analogs-work-low-tech-process-based-restoration-explained\">beaver-inspired habitat systems</a> to hold more water in the soil and extend flows through dry summer months.</p><p>For Kirby, the project is deeply personal. Having lost her home in Colorado’s 2001 Hayman Fire, she views the 910 Ranch as a generational investment in stewardship.</p><p>“This ranch is a legacy piece,” she said. “With the help of partnerships, this is going to be the biggest thing I’ll do in my career. It connects nearly 55,000 acres of protected land from Park City into Morgan County. When my grandkids come here someday, they’re going to say, ‘Look what Grandma helped do.’” </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jae-H_I0B_w\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch Utah Pioneers a New Model for Wildfire Resilience\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Video: \"Utah Pioneers a New Model for Wildfire Resilience\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>The Path Forward: Building a Model for the West</h3><p>The URF shows that proactive investment in wildfire resilience can protect forests and communities upstream, while benefiting those downstream.
