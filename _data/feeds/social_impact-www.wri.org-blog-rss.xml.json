      "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>YAOUNDÉ  (July 11, 2025) </strong>– Yesterday, eight African nations — Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria — adopted the Yaoundé Declaration, committing to sustainably manage 100% of ocean areas under their national jurisdiction by 2030. The commitment was made at the International Conference on the Blue Economy in the Gulf of Guinea, held in Yaoundé, Cameroon. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Through the regional declaration, the eight countries have pledged to develop and implement Sustainable Ocean Plans (SOPs) that will guide the sustainable use, protection, and restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems. Other commitments will seek to tackle Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU) and strengthen marine security. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Following is a statement from Wanjira Mathai, Director of WRI Africa:</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">“The ocean is one interconnected system that spans beyond national borders, and governments must manage it that way. The Yaoundé Declaration is a powerful signal of regional leadership, showing that countries across the Gulf of Guinea are not just willing, but determined to build a sustainable, inclusive blue economy together.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">“With the Our Ocean Conference coming to Kenya next year, this commitment sets the tone for African leadership on the global stage. Transboundary cooperation like this also helps shift African wisdom, solutions and priorities to the forefront, steering ambitious, homegrown answers to ocean challenges.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Following is a statement from Cynthia Barzuna, Deputy Director of WRI’s Ocean Program:</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">“The Gulf of Guinea is one of the world’s richest marine ecosystems — a lifeline for millions who rely on it for food and jobs. But it’s under siege from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. The Sustainable Ocean Plans these countries will develop offer a clear, actionable blueprint to manage 100% of their waters, balancing protection, prosperity and resilience.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">“This commitment positions the Gulf of Guinea as a driving force in a global wave for ocean sustainability. It directly aligns with the goal of Ocean Panel, a coalition of 18 countries working towards 100% sustainable management of national waters. The Panel pioneered the concept of Sustainable Ocean Plans and, through the 100% Alliance, is urging all coastal and ocean states to follow suit.”</span> <br /> <br /><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Editor’s note: WRI serves as Secretariat of the </span></em><a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy</span></em></a><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> — a group of 18 heads of state and government from countries committed to sustainably managing 100% of their national waters by 2030 — and coordinates the </span></em><a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">100% Alliance</span></em></a><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, a global initiative co-led by Chile and France that encourages all other coastal and island countries to make that same commitment.</span></em></p>",

      "description": "<p>More companies are assessing water risks, either voluntarily or in response to regulatory requirements. However, navigating the complex and diverse water challenges across global portfolios while under pressure from external stakeholders is complex. Global-level data is useful for a broad view, yet assessing water risks effectively also requires local insights.</p><p>Companies rely on tools like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/water-risk-atlas/#/?advanced=false&basemap=hydro&indicator=w_awr_def_tot_cat&lat=30&lng=-80&mapMode=view&month=1&opacity=0.5&ponderation=DEF&predefined=false&projection=absolute&scenario=optimistic&scope=baseline&threshold&timeScale=annual&year=baseline&zoom=3\">Aqueduct’s Water Risk Atlas</a> to identify which parts of their operations and value chain face significant water risks. Aqueduct’s indicators are based on peer-reviewed, open-source, globally consistent data and methods, allowing for global benchmarking and screening. Water risks in Chicago can be directly compared to water risks in Cape Town and Cairo, all at the click of a button.</p><p>However, it’s important to recognize that Aqueduct presents a high-level view, not a ground truth assessment of water risks. Once global data is collected, companies should validate the results internally through staff conversations and externally through outreach as they finalize their priorities.</p><p>WRI partnered with Unilever to share a few real-world examples of how Unilever enhanced its water stewardship prioritization exercise by complementing the global Aqueduct results with targeted local feedback and insights.</p><h3>Bridging the Global-to-Local Gap</h3><p>A prioritization exercise is an essential part of the water stewardship journey. It helps companies make informed decisions on where to act, given that water is local and companies cannot act everywhere.</p><p>In Unilever’s case, the company must assess more than 300 production sites, offices and warehouses across 100 countries. It’d be nearly impossible for Unilever to run a water risk assessment of this scale using only local data. It could lead to data quality issues, data definition discrepancies and even data scarcity. By using Aqueduct’s global indicators, Unilever can spend fewer resources assessing water risks and more resources on taking action.</p><p>After this first step, Unilever contacts facility managers whose sites fall within a high-risk sub-basin, giving them the opportunity to provide feedback. If a manager disputes the water stress status — for example, if the Aqueduct data doesn’t reflect the reality on the ground — Unilever often brings in expert consultants to investigate the location using local data, such as details on the facility’s water source, provider and key water infrastructure.</p><h3>When Global and Local Data Align</h3><p>Using Aqueduct’s Baseline Water Stress (BWS) indicator, which measures the competition over water resources, Unilever found that the global results resonated with local understanding the vast majority of the time. This holds true across different geographies and levels of water stress.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24015725/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Unilever found that on sites exposed to Aqueduct’s most extreme water stress — where water demand outpaces natural replenishment — facility managers felt the challenge on the ground.</p><p>For example, in Konya, Turkey, Aqueduct showed extremely high levels of water stress, and local staff confirmed this challenge.</p><p>Turkey is a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/highest-water-stressed-countries\">highly water-stressed</a> country. It’s been plagued by recurring droughts in recent years that have impacted both <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-istanbul-water-residents-urged-save-catastrophic-drought\">people</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/thousands-flamingos-die-drought-central-turkey-2021-07-15/\">nature</a>. In Konya, competition over water resources is extremely high. Agriculture uses around 90%, leaving very little for domestic and industrial demand. According to Aqueduct, water demand exceeds the renewable, available water supply for three months of the year.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24015814/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Unilever found through ground truthing that the region faces major water challenges, including sharply declining groundwater tables, erosion and even sinkholes in the landscape. This kind of corroborating local feedback, and alignment between global and on-the-ground data, reinforces the site’s priority status and creates momentum for action internally throughout the company, from the management team to the local facility team.</p><h3>When Global and Local Data Mismatch</h3><p>Despite its utility, a global model will never replace local knowledge. Aqueduct’s indicators are built using global assumptions, resulting in unique limitations that users must consider when evaluating the data. Specifically, Aqueduct is limited in its ability to model the local management of water.</p><p>Unilever found through its validation process with site managers that for a few facilities, the lived experience is different from what Aqueduct’s Baseline Water Stress indicator reported.</p><h4>Reporting water stress in freshwater-abundant areas</h4><p>Aqueduct reported high water stress in a few sub-basins next to the Great Lakes in North America — a region with abundant freshwater. How is this possible? This mismatch is due to how Aqueduct allocates water supply from Lake Michigan, routing water through natural discharge points rather than the human-made intake points.</p><p>To begin with, water demand is extremely high in the region. Illinois ranks as the fourth largest industrial water user in the world.</p><p>However, high water demand does not necessarily mean high water stress. In the case of the Great Lakes, human engineering enables water users to access its supply from <a href=\"https://graphics.chicagotribune.com/news/lake-michigan-drinking-water-rates/lake-map.html\">multiple intake locations</a> across the shoreline — a dynamic that no global hydrological model can capture because there is no <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/mapping-public-water-management-harmonizing-and-sharing-corporate-water-risk-information\">global dataset</a> on the human transfer and management of water.</p><p>Instead, Aqueduct models the outflow from Lake Michigan through the drainage network based on elevation data. In Unilever’s case, we found that Aqueduct models the outflow from Lake Michigan through the sub-basin adjacent to where it operates.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24015947/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Because Aqueduct only uses a sub-basin's internal water supply to calculate its risk, agnostic to what neighboring basins have, Unilever’s resulting water stress score is high. Based on feedback from the local facility manager and consultations with the Aqueduct team, Unilever removed the facility from their prioritization exercise but kept it on the list for regulatory disclosures for consistency.   </p><h4>Reporting water abundance in areas of high stress</h4><p>In a sub-basin near São Paulo in Brazil, Unilever encountered a different kind of discrepancy. This time, the local facility managers disagreed with Aqueduct’s low water stress result. They reported to Unilever’s sustainability team that the facility experienced water shortages in the past and had even resorted to trucking in water at times.</p><p>Indeed, São Paulo and its surrounding area have faced many water challenges in recent years. In 2014, the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/help-sao-paulos-complex-water-woes-protect-and-restore-forests#:~:text=Managing%20alternating%20droughts%20and%20floods,trees%20in%20the%20right%20places.\">city nearly ran out of water</a>. A major driver of the region’s water stress is poor water quality, something not captured by Aqueduct’s indicator. If the water is too polluted to use, then there will be less water available to use than Aqueduct models suggest. As a result, local <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02007-0\">water stress will be intensified</a>.  </p><p>In this area, water quality issues are largely driven by land degradation. Forests, for example, help to filter out pollutants, reduce heat and stabilize rainfall and soil moisture. Unfortunately, over three-quarters of the forest in São Paulo’s headwaters have been lost.  </p><p>Compounding the water quality issue are large water transfers to the city of São Paulo, which are not modeled by Aqueduct.</p><p>Unilever understood that information shouldn’t only flow from the sustainability team to local facilities. Rather, the company took the local reports seriously and commissioned a regional analysis through external consultants to better understand the water challenges and potential solutions.  As a result, Unilever added this facility to its prioritization exercise.</p><h3>How to Reflect Local Realities in Water Risk Assessments</h3><p>Unilever’s case study shows that integrating local feedback into global risk assessments helps the company manage water risks more effectively by improving the prioritization process. Here are our key takeaways for companies to enhance their global water risk assessments with local feedback to ensure they reflect real-world conditions on the ground:</p><h4>1) Use global data as a starting point</h4><p>After using Aqueduct to run a water risk assessment, use the results to start conversations with your facility managers and other internal stakeholders. Allow information to flow in all directions. Create a list of locations to investigate for further analysis. These may include:</p><ul><li>Places with the highest levels of risk.</li><li>Places with high risk and high business materiality metrics, such as financial value or product volume.</li><li>Places where the Aqueduct result does not align with the local perception, whether it's an overestimation or underestimation of risk.</li></ul><h4>2) Document any global-local deviations</h4><p>Clearly document all conversations, sources and research used to supplement the Aqueduct indicator. This is especially important when reporting to regulatory disclosure frameworks.</p><h4>3) Review and revise often</h4><p>Water stewardship is an iterative process. Periodically check in on your priority sites (or potential priority sites) to assess whether any should be reclassified based on changing conditions. For example, a water risk assessment should be rerun when Aqueduct is updated every few years or when a company adds new facilities.</p><h4>4) Communicate and share internally and externally</h4><p>At its core, water stewardship must be a collaborative exercise. The more companies talk publicly and share experiences with global-to-local data integration, the faster the community can connect, learn from one another and work toward water-secure outcomes. Communication should happen both internally and externally. Internally, communicate with teams outside the sustainability department, such as procurement, to enhance corporation action. Externally, share lessons with peer organizations and others operating in priority locations to foster collective action.</p><h3>Using the Data for the Right Purpose</h3><p>The integration of global and local data can strengthen the prioritization exercise, enrich the narrative and generate buy-in, ultimately improving the company’s water stewardship interventions.</p><p>What’s important is understanding how to supplement global data with local knowledge and understanding, whether you are using Aqueduct or any other global data product. Global data is a good place to start, but real change on the ground cannot be achieved without ground truth data.</p>",

Its operators perform miracles every day, instantaneously connecting electricity supply from thousands of power plants with the demands of over 400 million people. Amazingly, this machine is 99.95% reliable; the average U.S. customer loses power <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/news/detail/program/2024/top-10-things-to-know-about-power-grid-reliability\">only twice a year for a total of five hours.</a></p><p>However, 70% of the grid is over 50 years old, and it’s being tested in unprecedented ways.

By deploying advanced transmission technologies, the U.S. can expand and modernize the power grid. Photo by B. Christopher / Alamy Stock Photo.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>What Are Advanced Transmission Technologies?</h3><p>Advanced transmission technologies are a promising set of tools that can be used to quickly and cheaply expand the capacity and improve the operation of the existing grid. The category includes both <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/events/2024/3/getting-most-out-existing-new-infrastructure-advanced-transmission-technologies\">grid enhancing technologies</a> that can be installed on top of the existing grid, as well as <a href=\"https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002030547\">advanced conductors</a> that can replace and increase the capacity of existing lines. These technologies are well-tested and have already been widely deployed across the world.</p><p>Despite their “advanced” label, many advanced transmission technologies are surprisingly simple in concept. Take <a href=\"https://watt-transmission.org/what-are-grid-enhancing-technologies/\">improvements to the line ratings</a> for example: To limit the risk of overheating, transmission lines have historically been rated “statically,” meaning they only transmit power up to a threshold, conservatively set to be safe under the hottest conditions (when lines are unable to carry as much power as when it's cooler).</p><p>However, colder temperatures and higher winds actively cool transmission lines and therefore allow them to safely carry more power than their static line rating would suggest. This means that almost all statically-rated lines could be transmitting <a href=\"https://watt-transmission.org/about-dynamic-line-ratings/\">at least 10% more capacity 90% of the time</a>. When simple sensors are installed, new “dynamic” line ratings (DLRs) can be adjusted in real time as wind and temperature shifts, allowing around 30% to 50% more power to be transmitted in favorable climates.</p><p>Other advanced transmission technologies use complex technologies to improve grid efficiency. For example, advanced power flow control devices (APFCs) allow grid operators to control how power is flowing across the grid by changing the resistances of different power pathways. Electricity, like water, flows along the path of least resistance. Building on this analogy, <a href=\"https://watt-transmission.org/about-advanced-power-flow-control/\">The WATT Coalition</a> describes APFCs as “partial dams” which can be used to redirect “water” (power) across different channels, ensuring that more of the grid is used efficiently. APFCs boost overall system capacity and reduce congestion costs.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"2250\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1800\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"1378\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"1086\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"650\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Examples of advanced transmission technologies.\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/25-6-18-advanced-transmission-technology-insights-2.png?VersionId=Tk1USovPA0QiOVhSqIhXInYtmOj8YZf.&itok=svDhty8K\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>What Are the Benefits to Scaling Advanced Transmission Technologies?</h3><p>Perhaps the greatest advantage of advanced transmission technologies is that they can be deployed in a fraction of the time it takes to build new transmission lines. On the shorter end, DLR projects take an average of only <a href=\"https://www.2035report.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GridLab_2035-Reconductoring-Technical-Report.pdf\">three months</a> to complete. Even more ambitious projects, like converting a line so that it transports direct current power instead of alternating current power, can triple the capacity of an existing line in half the time it takes to build a new line.</p><p>Secondly, advanced transmission technologies are cheaper to build than new transmission lines and unlock far more economic benefits than costs. Upgrading transmission lines with new, higher capacity advanced conductors can provide similar gains in capacity compared with building new transmission lines, yet they can be anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.2035report.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GridLab_2035-Reconductoring-Technical-Report.pdf\">five to 10 times cheaper</a> per-mile. Grid enhancing technologies like DLR can provide an even greater cost-benefit return. In 2018, the Midwestern utility <a href=\"https://inl.gov/content/uploads/2023/03/A-Guide-to-Case-Studies-for-Grid-Enhancing-Technologies.pdf\">AEP spent $500,000 to install DLR on 25 miles</a> of its lines. In only 10 months of monitoring, the system saved more than $15 million in congestion costs, providing a whopping 30 to 1 benefit-cost ratio in less than a year of operation.</p><p>Finally, advanced transmission technologies can improve reliability and public safety by reducing the likelihood of grid failures and wildfires. Take DLR, for example: On our warming planet, temperatures may sometimes be hotter than the ones used to conservatively set static line ratings. Whereas static lines will maintain line current even in high heat, lines with DLR will sense the extreme weather and lower current, reducing the risk of the line sagging into vegetation and igniting a fire. Advanced conductors also mitigate wildfire risk by reducing sag, while APFC systems can help quickly deenergize parts of the grid when needed.</p><p>Though the study of advanced transmission technologies for wildfire mitigation is an emerging field, governments are already recognizing their potential. For example, Utah’s recently passed <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0212.html\">HB 212</a> directs utilities to study advanced transmission technologies for their wildfire mitigation potential as part of the utilities’ integrated resource plans. </p><h3>What Progress Is Being Made to Implement Advanced Transmission Technologies?</h3><p>Hundreds of utilities have already deployed advanced transmission technologies successfully in the U.S. Survey studies compiled by the Idaho National Laboratory for <a href=\"https://inl.gov/content/uploads/2023/03/A-Guide-to-Case-Studies-for-Grid-Enhancing-Technologies.pdf\">grid enhancing technologies</a> and <a href=\"https://inl.gov/content/uploads/2024/02/23-50856_R4a_-Use-Case-Studies.pdf\">advanced conductors</a> attest to their high benefit-cost ratios, ease of implementation and quick payback periods. To date, most of the advanced transmission technology projects undertaken by U.S. utilities have been voluntary and limited in scope. However, there are hopeful signs that U.S. policymakers are beginning to recognize the potential of advanced transmission technologies to meet our grid challenges quickly and cost-effectively and will enact legislation to make them more widespread.</p><p>Policy activity on advanced transmission technologies has been particularly <a href=\"https://www.ncelenviro.org/articles/increasing-transmission-and-grid-enhancing-technologies-gets/\">robust at the state level</a>. Since 2023, more than 10 states governed by both Republicans and Democrats have adopted advanced transmission technology legislation. Proving momentum, in 2025 alone, <a href=\"https://watt-transmission.org/state-policy-momentum-builds-for-grid-enhancing-technologies-in-2025/\">17 states</a> saw the introduction of related bills. These bills primarily work by requiring utilities and other transmission owners to study advanced transmission technologies as alternatives to building new lines. For example, South Carolina’s recently passed <a href=\"https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess126_2025-2026/bills/3309.htm\">H 3309</a> requires utilities to assess advanced transmission technologies as solutions for transmission needs within their integrated resource planning process.</p><p>Activity at the national level is happening as well. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued <a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/presentation-e-1-implementation-dynamic-line-ratings\">an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking</a> (ANOPR) last June that included a framework for requiring DLR on transmission lines. This has received broad support in comments from consumer advocate groups, utilities and grid operators. <a href=\"https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/docinfo?accession_number=20241112-5349&sid=2abb364d-81e7-43a7-a3a5-0ebf79a34ee5\">Supporters of a DLR requirement argue</a> that such a regulation is necessary to secure “just and reasonable” electricity rates — core to FERC’s mandate — because of the cost savings that DLR unlocks for consumers.</p><h3>What Are the Major Barriers to Deployment and How Can We Overcome Them?</h3><p>Advanced transmission technologies have not been widely deployed in the U.S., and many utilities, regulators, policymakers and consumers remain unaware of their benefits. Requirements to study advanced transmission technologies in utility proceedings such as integrated resource plans and (including those recently passed by <a href=\"https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/422/details\">Indiana</a> and <a href=\"https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/hb15\">Ohio</a>) will help to raise awareness of their benefits while giving advocates greater leverage to push for their adoption. and <a href=\"https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/hb15\">Ohio</a>) will help to raise awareness of their benefits while giving advocates greater leverage to push for their adoption.</p><p>Governors can also work to <a href=\"https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_Advanced_Grid_Technologies.pdf\">encourage adoption</a>. In 2023, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey convened a working group to study advanced transmission technologies and make recommendations for their adoption in New England. Governors can also include them in their budget requests, as New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham did in the 2026 budget by <a href=\"https://www.nmdfa.state.nm.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Executive-Budget-FY26-Digital.pdf\">calling for a $1 million grid modernization</a> grant program. </p><p>Ironically, the low costs of advanced transmission technologies, which make them such promising tools to quickly meet grid challenges, are also a barrier to their implementation. Simply put, they don’t make utilities as much money. Under traditional <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/jc-kibbey/utility-accountability-101-how-do-utilities-make-money\">“cost of service”</a> business models, regulated utilities are allowed to recover their capital costs plus an allowed rate of return through electricity prices.</p><p>As several advocates <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/jc-kibbey/utility-accountability-101-how-do-utilities-make-money\">have pointed out,</a> this incentive structure means that utilities can make more money by pursuing capital-intensive projects like new transmission lines over cheaper advanced transmission technology projects. Furthermore, these projects are not yet eligible for cost recovery in some states, meaning utilities aren’t able to profit from deploying advanced transmission technologies. Things are slowly changing, however; recent bills passed in <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/MT/bill/HB729/2023\">Montana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&legType=B&legNo=93&year=25\">New Mexico,</a> <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0212.html\">Utah</a> and <a href=\"https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/422/details\">Indiana</a> have authorized cost recovery for these technologies.</p><p>Reforming outdated business models should be considered to spur adoption. One such proposal called “<a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/shared-savings-approach-to-transmission-incentives-finds-support-concern-a/606474/\">shared savings”</a> would allow utilities to recoup some of the savings that result from projects in their electricity rates. Another policy idea, called <a href=\"https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/PBR_Deck_final.pdf\">performance-based ratemaking</a>, would tie utility profits to meeting certain performance targets that incentivize advanced transmission technologies — for example, a target to increase the amount of power a utility can carry on its existing system. Finally, shifting from incentivizing to explicitly requiring utilities to deploy advanced transmission technologies in the public interest, as FERC did with the DLR ANOPR, is another way to deploy these technologies at scale.</p><h3>A Critical Investment</h3><p>At a time when customers face <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/rising-gas-electric-bills-survey\">rising energy bills</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/average-lead-times-to-build-new-electricity-grid-assets-in-europe-and-the-united-states-2010-2021\">terawatts of clean energy languish</a> in queues to interconnect to the grid because of a lack of grid capacity, advanced transmission technologies represent our best hope for quickly and cost-effectively reducing the pressure on our grid. These technologies are essential complements to new lines and must at least be considered by utilities and regulators when they review proposals to increase transmission capacity.</p><p>In the U.S., momentum is growing to deploy advanced transmission technologies at scale, and an abundance of evidence shows that these technologies are safe, effective and affordable. Let us build on this momentum to secure the prosperous clean energy future we all deserve.</p><p><em>WRI's </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/profile/ian-goldsmith\"><em>Ian Goldsmith</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>Since the start of 2025, a quiet yet profound shift has begun to reshape global finance. In January, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/blk-commentary-engagement-on-natural-capital.pdf\">publicly acknowledged</a> that \"nature capital\" — including biodiversity, water, soil and geology — plays a vital role in sustaining long-term corporate performance. For the first time at this scale, natural capital is being treated not as an externality but as a core asset class.</p><p>BlackRock isn't the only one. In early March, Goldman Sachs Asset Management introduced its <a href=\"https://www.theglobaltreasurer.com/2025/03/03/goldman-sachs-launches-biodiversity-bond-fund-to-strengthen-sustainable-investing/\">Biodiversity Bond Fund</a>: a groundbreaking fixed-income instrument dedicated to financing biodiversity protection and restoration.</p><p>Just weeks later, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, which manages $1.6 trillion in assets, released an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/why-valuing-nature-people-is-just-important-financials-2025-03-19/\">assessment of nature-related risks</a> across approximately 90% of its portfolio, examining how investee companies both depend on and impact ecosystems.</p><p>These developments reflect a growing consensus among financial institutions: <strong>The current finance system must be reshaped to account for the foundational role of nature.</strong></p><h3>Putting Nature on the Balance Sheet</h3><p>Nature is disappearing at a staggering rate. The latest <a href=\"https://wwflpr.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/2024-living-planet-report-a-system-in-peril.pdf\">Living Planet Report</a> revealed that wildlife populations plummeted by more than 70% on average over the last 50 years. <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\">Forests</a>, the ocean and other critical ecosystems are in peril due to human-driven destruction and climate change. This collapse of natural systems can have <a href=\"https://livingplanet.panda.org/nature-loss-impacts/\">devastating consequences</a> both locally and globally, from the disappearance of fisheries and loss of coastal livelihoods to large-scale food system disruptions, natural disasters and economic instability.</p><p>Yet despite these growing risks, much of the financial system still prioritizes short-term returns, often at the expense of long-term environmental and economic resilience. As a result, capital continues to flow toward activities that overtax and degrade ecosystems (think: overfishing, unsustainable logging or razing rainforests for agriculture). In 2022, the private sector invested at least $5 trillion in activities that directly harm nature. This was 140 times <em>more </em>than it spent on nature-positive activities, according to the <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/global-annual-finance-flows-7-trillion-fueling-climate-biodiversity\">UN Environment Programme</a>.</p><p>Even sustainable finance largely passes over nature. While green bonds are a growing asset class, the majority of proceeds are directed toward climate-related projects, with <a href=\"https://www.sustainablefitch.com/corporate-finance/biodiversity-in-esg-state-of-sustainable-finance-market-09-10-2023\">relatively few</a> allocated to biodiversity.</p><p>But this status quo cannot hold in the face of ongoing ecosystem decline. With <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2020/01/half-of-world-s-gdp-moderately-or-highly-dependent-on-nature-says-new-report/\">over half of global GDP</a> highly dependent on nature, the risks are not just environmental — they are financial.</p><p>From a long-term investment standpoint, failing to account for nature degradation exposes portfolios to escalating material risks and jeopardizes future growth and revenue. One recent study finds that a collapse in key ecosystem services like wild pollination, marine fisheries and timber provision could result in annual economic losses of <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/07/01/protecting-nature-could-avert-global-economic-losses-of-usd2-7-trillion-per-year\">$2.7 trillion</a> (2.3% of global GDP) by 2030. Another found that physical nature risks could reduce the valuations of seven major U.K. banks <a href=\"https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GFI-GREENING-FINANCE-FOR-NATURE-FINAL-FULL-REPORT-RDS4.pdf\">by 4%-5%</a> over the next decade.</p><p>Financial institutions are also under mounting scrutiny thanks to emerging regulations — such as the EU <a href=\"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance/disclosures/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en\">Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation</a> (SFDR) and <a href=\"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance/tools-and-standards/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en\">EU Taxonomy</a> — that mandate the disclosure of nature- and climate-related risks. The cost and consequences of noncompliance are rising and are becoming financially material.</p><p>As the financial sector begins to reckon with these risks, growing recognition of nature's value by influential players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs signals that the tide is turning. Now, mainstream financial institutions must build on this momentum — leveraging their roles as lenders, investors, insurers and advisers to actively steer capital away from nature-destructive activities. A critical first step is to begin accounting for nature on the balance sheet.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A bee on a flower.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/bee_0.jpg?VersionId=arrS6tPLS3x5dA4meOpZ_TMwIMNYIdGd&itok=oN4vAdhx\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Ecosystem services like pollination, healthy soils and water regulation underpin much of the global economy. Photo by Lakshmi Narasimha/Unsplash</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Nature-Based Solutions: A Strategic Response to Growing Nature Risks</h3><p>There are two powerful ways that banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial actors can drive meaningful change for nature.</p><p>For one, financial institutions can act as direct drivers of sustainable finance by allocating capital to initiatives that protect, enhance or restore ecosystems. This includes direct investments in nature-based initiatives through dedicated funds (like Mirova's <a href=\"https://www.mirova.com/en/invest/natural-capital\">Natural Capital Fund</a>) or investing in companies that embed nature-positive practices (such as regenerative agriculture) into their operations and supply chains.</p><p>Second, financial institutions can help enable broader, system-level change through their financing decisions. For instance, banks could divest from companies that fail to comply with regulations such as the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/explain-eu-deforestation-regulation\">EU Deforestation Regulation</a> (EUDR). Or they could deploy financing structures that reward nature-friendly business models — from sustainability-linked loans to performance-based finance. In doing so, financial institutions can help reshape markets and realign incentives to favor long-term ecological and economic resilience.</p><p><strong>In this context, \"</strong><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\"><strong>nature-based solutions</strong></a><strong>\" offer a powerful tool for the finance sector. </strong>Nature-based solutions are actions that leverage healthy ecosystems to address some of today's most pressing issues, such as climate change and disaster risk, while also benefitting people and nature. This could include restoring upstream forests to support climate regulation and improve water flows for hydropower; adopting sustainable farming practices to boost soil health and productivity; installing green infrastructure in cities to manage heat and flooding; or deploying biotech innovations, such as algae for wastewater treatment.</p><p><strong>These are real, emerging investment opportunities that can deliver substantial returns </strong><em><strong>and </strong></em><strong>long-term benefits for nature. </strong>Take Natura & Co., a global beauty brand that integrates biodiversity-based sourcing from the Amazon into its core business. By investing in supplier communities and nature-positive practices, Natura has not only mitigated supply chain risk, but also <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-022-09890-y\">tripled its stock price</a> between 2015 and 2020. This surge in market valuation reflects stronger financial returns as well as growing investor and consumer confidence in a nature-positive business model.</p><p>Similarly, the AXA WF ACT Biodiversity fund invests in companies contributing to ecosystem preservation and restoration. With reported returns of <a href=\"https://carbon-pulse.com/267890/\">approximately 10%</a>, it demonstrates the financial viability of such investment approaches.</p><p>Investing in solutions like these offers financial institutions an opportunity to align impact with returns and position themselves at the forefront of a rapidly evolving market landscape. Meanwhile, it can help them mitigate nature-related risks, enhance portfolio resilience, and stay ahead of tightening regulatory and sustainability standards.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Boats on a river in a lush green forest.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/indonesia-river_0.jpg?VersionId=rhcgn_C8zSOZzSD7.oPxs_FVqeDezi0c&itok=ILpznZ7i\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Investing in businesses and activities the protect, restore or sustainably use ecosystems can offer long-term financial returns.

Many institutions struggle with internal capacity constraints, including limited expertise to evaluate, structure and manage nature-based assets effectively. This can make it hard to identify investable opportunities or appropriately assess nature-related risks and returns.</p><p>In addition, the investment landscape for nature-based solutions is still immature. There is a limited pipeline of high-integrity, scalable projects. Many are small in size, requiring aggregation or blended finance to be viable, which often comes with high transaction costs. Long time horizons (10-30+ years), uncertain return profiles and limited liquidity present further barriers — particularly when compared to traditional assets, such as equities, real estate or bonds, that offer more immediate financial returns.</p><p>But there are ways forward.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/financial-sector-guidebook-nature-based-solutions-investment\">New WRI research</a> offers a comprehensive framework to help mainstream investors understand, invest in and leverage nature-based solutions effectively. It shows how financial institutions can leverage existing tools — such as sustainability-linked loans, blended finance structures and high-quality impact measurement frameworks — to begin integrating nature-based solutions into core investment processes today. In doing so, financial institutions can go beyond isolated project-level investments and begin catalyzing broader system change by influencing investee companies to shift entire value chains toward nature-positive outcomes.</p><h3>Financing Nature Is Financing the Future</h3><p>Progress this year signals a growing recognition of nature-related risks and opportunities among major financial actors. But this is only the start. To truly turn the tide, we need a systemic shift within the financial sector — one that prioritizes long-term impacts over short-term gains and fully integrates nature-related risks into financial decision-making and balance sheets. It is time to act now, moving from inspiration to operation to prevent ecosystems from passing irreversible tipping points.</p><p>For institutions looking to future-proof their portfolios, respond to evolving regulations and stay competitive in a sustainability-driven market, investing in nature-based solutions offers both an opportunity and an advantage. By embedding these solutions into their strategies, financial institutions can send powerful market signals to companies across their portfolios, encouraging nature-positive practices and further investment in ecosystem protection and restoration.</p><p>Ultimately, investing in nature is not just about doing good for the planet — it's a smart strategy to secure long-term value in an era of mounting ecological and financial volatility.</p><p><em>To learn more, read WRI's new </em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/financial-sector-guidebook-nature-based-solutions-investment\"><em>Financial Sector Guidebook on Nature-Based Solutions Investment</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Proven solutions exist, and it is well understood where and how to effectively apply them. In collaboration with the World Bank, WRI has developed the <a href=\"https://www.globalroadsafetyfacility.org/publications/guide-safe-speeds-managing-traffic-speeds-save-lives-and-improve-livability\">Guide for Safe Speeds: Managing Traffic Speeds to Save Lives and Improve Livability.</a> This guide presents strong evidence to support informed decision-making and addresses common misconceptions about speed management.</p><h3>Why Speed Management Matters Beyond Safety </h3><p>Managing speed isn’t just about safety — it’s also a powerful tool for improving quality of life, especially in urban areas. Slower traffic speeds reduce air and noise pollution, create safer spaces for walking and cycling and even help alleviate urban congestion, despite common misconceptions. These improvements encourage active mobility and support public health by reducing exposure to harmful pollutants and promoting physical activity. </p><h3><strong>Adopting a New Approach to Speed Limits</strong> </h3><p>Instead of reacting to crashes after they occur, the guide promotes a forward-looking, systemic strategy grounded in the <a href=\"https://toolkit.irap.org/management/safe-system-approach/\">Safe System approach</a>. This model recognizes that while human error is inevitable, both road fatalities and serious injuries are preventable and unacceptable.  </p><p>Central to the guide is the Roads-for-Life (R4L) framework — a practical, research-backed methodology for setting and evaluating speed limits. It follows four principles to ensure all speeds limits are safe and credible. <strong>Safety for all users</strong> is recognized as the guiding principle with <strong>community wellbeing</strong>, <strong>predictability</strong> and <strong>network availability</strong> as supporting principles to ensure equity, practicality, consistency and compliance.  </p><p>R4L not only helps determine safe speeds for existing roads but also assesses the safety implications of design speeds for new road projects. By aligning speed limits with road design and supporting them with the appropriate infrastructure, the framework enhances safety for all users within livable communities.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1500\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"919\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"433\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"The Roads-for-Life Framework (R4L).\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/the-roads-for-life-framework_0.png?VersionId=MC7qNUg7jJFLaOBBypSIXNET6Yg63ejI&itok=Q18itp3x\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p><strong>The Roads-for-Life Framework approach guides speed management implementation to achieve safer, more livable streets.</strong></p><p>While our transportation and traffic systems have historically prioritized vehicle movement over the safety of other users, this guide offers tools to help shift toward systems that create a safer environment for everyone. </p><p>In many countries, speed limits are still determined based on the “desired” speeds of drivers. However, this approach overlooks a critical reality — the speeds drivers choose are not inherently safe, particularly for vulnerable road users (VRUs). The R4L framework provides a more context-sensitive approach, using a road hierarchy to set speed limits, in urban and rural roads, based on the specific road environment, the type of infrastructure and the mix of users present. </p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1500\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"919\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"433\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Roads-for-Life framework for selecting safe speed limits for rural roads or road sections.\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/roads-for-life-framework-for-selecting-safe-speed-limits-for-rural-roads-or-road-sections_0.png?VersionId=ttM5M6daF7.8XEwJDD.lguoQowle84t0&itok=58fi_2Au\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p><strong>The Roads-for-Life Framework matrix helps select safe speed limits based on road type, function and presence of vulnerable road users in urban areas.  </strong></p><p>Building on this framework, the guide provides tools for decision makers and infrastructure engineers to implement effective speed management strategies and action plans. Once a city identifies a road for speed reduction interventions, it should classify the road type based on its capacity to move people and goods and the presence of vulnerable road users. Then, using the matrix, it can identify the safe speed limit. For example, an urban road with single lane roads in each direction, lined with coffee shops and small businesses where people frequently cross the street, would be classified as an “urban human activity road.” The safe speed limit for this road is a maximum of 30 kph (about 20 mph).  </p><h3><strong>Making Safe Speeds a Reality</strong> </h3><p>The guide provides a step-by-step approach to developing, implementing and monitoring speed management at a national, regional or local level. It also offers solutions for specific locations — such as busy arterial roads shared by vehicles and VRUs — outlining effective local policies, interventions, processes and enabling conditions for supporting safe speed limits. </p><p>Using case studies and emphasizing evidence-based interventions, the Guide for Safe Speeds serves as a key resource for policymakers seeking to make the case for safe speeds, secure political commitment and gain community support. By embracing these strategies, they can create safer, more livable environments for everyone on the road.  </p><p>The Guide for Safe Speeds was published with funding support from Bloomberg Philanthropies and UK Aid. </p>",

This is also where the majority of the 2024 fires took place, where most forest conversion to agriculture and cattle ranching has occurred, and where <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622816304568\">most people in the Amazon live</a>. But it is not the only part of the Amazon that’s threatened.</p><p>The twin cities of Leticia, Colombia and Tabatinga, Brazil lie at the heart of the thinly governed <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/investigations/beneath-surface-timber-trafficking-peru-colombia-brazil-border/\">tri-border area</a> of the northwestern Amazon, where Brazil, Colombia and Peru meet. A metropolitan area with a population of 110,000 lying just across the Amazon River from Peru, the two cities are <a href=\"https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/illicit-frontiers-criminal-governance-in-the-amazons-tri-border-region/\">the commercial center for a criminal economy</a> that has boomed over the past 25 years.

The coca plant (<em>Erythroxylum coca</em>) has traditionally been <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4838786/\">cultivated</a> in the Peruvian Andes for thousands of years. More recently, coca cultivation has spread in the lowland Amazon to supply the illicit drug trade. The <a href=\"https://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/cocaine/Global_cocaine_report_2023.pdf\">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> reported in 2023 that cocaine’s use worldwide was at an all-time high.</p><p>Seizing on this insatiable global demand, <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/south-america/brazil-colombia-peru/b51-three-border-problem\">a shifting constellation of Brazilian, Peruvian and Colombian organized crime enterprises</a> have, over the past 25 years, systematically expanded coca cultivation and cocaine production in the tri-border area, including the critical transport route to Manaus about 1,000 kilometers downriver and onward to urban Brazil, Europe and elsewhere. A <a href=\"https://ojo-publico.com/5581/narco-territory-70-amazonian-borders\">2025 report</a> by investigative journalism outlet Ojo Público determined that criminal organizations dominating the cocaine trade in the tri-border region were present in 54 of 75 border towns. While the razing of the rainforest for coca production in the tri-border area is not on the scale of clearing for agriculture and cattle in other parts of the Amazon, it is locally significant — particularly in the Peruvian border Province of <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/investigations/expanding-drug-trafficking-peru-colombia-brazil-border/\">Mariscal Ramon Castilla</a> and in the neighboring Department of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66784678\">Putumayo</a> in Colombia.</p><p>But moreover, cocaine development leads to other nature crimes that also fuel deforestation. In the tri-border area, Ojo Público found, for example, that drug trafficking is linked with the illegal timber trade — a sort of criminal “economy of scale.” Government suppression of airborne smuggling routes has also increasingly <a href=\"https://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/docs.iza.org/dp17425.pdf\">displaced drug trafficking</a> and associated violence to the river routes, and hence to the Amazon border area.</p><p>Here, the criminal infrastructure built principally for cocaine is increasingly <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/south-america/brazil-colombia-peru/b51-three-border-problem\">facilitating illegal deforestation, timber trafficking and illegal gold mining,</a> via control of transport routes, corruption and intimidation of local authorities and communities, as well as the fear of violence.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24031610/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Tree cover loss has steadily increased in the tri-border area, often driven by illegal activities. Data from Global Forest Watch.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The convergence between nature crimes and drug trafficking in the Amazon is also greatly facilitated by the “<a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/06/environmental-crimes-are-often-hidden-by-flying-money-laundering-schemes-commentary/\">flying money</a>” rackets run by Chinese organized crime groups. Essentially, this is a combined barter-and-money-laundering system where precursor chemicals from China for the manufacture of fentanyl and other illicit drugs in Latin America are traded off the books for Amazonian wildlife, gold and other products of forest crime, thus serving as both a payment system and a method of laundering illicit funds.</p><p>Among those most impacted by this crime wave are Indigenous Peoples. The Amazon is home to some <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151921/indigenous-communities-protect-the-amazon\">1.5 million Indigenous People</a>, whose ancestral territories are some of the most <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-and-local-community-land-rights-protect-biodiversity\">effective forest conservation areas</a>. However, many Indigenous territories in the Amazon are not effectively protected by law or government authorities. This, in combination with their relative abundance of valuable timber, wildlife and gold, makes these areas attractive targets for <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/brazil-yanomami-mining-malaria-malnutrition-lula\">illegal mining</a> and <a href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/illegal-logging-threatens-lives-and-culture-of-indigenous-people-in-the-maranhao-amazon-in\">logging</a>.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Illegal gold mining in the Brazilian Amazon\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/illegal-gold-mining-brazil_0.jpeg?VersionId=bSbxrv2rdeNGYfEbFaYfOqMnYd5J7j0O&itok=8GpuHaai\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Aerial view of an illegal gold mining operation.

Gold mining is a massive part of the illegal economy in the Amazon’s tri-border area and beyond, generating <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cartels-are-making-more-money-from-gold-than-drugs-thanks-to-legal-loopholes-experts-say/ar-AA1D6aVB\">greater profits than cocaine</a>. While some mining directly clears forests, other mining is river-based.

Given the Amazon’s <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2022/07/overexploitation-threatens-amazon-fisheries-with-collapse-study-warns/\">rich fisheries</a>, it is not surprising that a booming illicit trade in high-value fish such as the protected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/03/poaching-brazil-amazon-fishing-pirarucu-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira\">pirarucu</a> (<em>Arapaima gigas</em>) has become yet another <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/the-battle-to-save-brazils-freshwater-giant-the-arapaima/\">criminal profit center</a> in the Brazilian Amazon. The world’s largest freshwater fish is taken for its meat, scales and for the aquarium trade. It was pirarucu traffickers who in 2022 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/11/world/americas/amazon-murder-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira.html\">murdered</a> British journalist Dom Phillips<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/#footnotes\"><sup>2</sup></a> and Bruno Pereira, a member of Brazil’s Indigenous protection agency FUNAI, to thwart their investigation into illegal activities in the isolated Javari Valley on the Peruvian border.

The Ecuadorian Amazon was largely spared the scourge of natural resource-related crime until recently. This <a href=\"https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/the-road-to-chaos-ecuador/\">changed dramatically in the past five years</a>; there are thought to be at least 22 organized “narco-terrorist” groups operating in the country as of 2024. As in neighboring countries, narco-trafficking gangs in Ecuador have rapidly expanded into <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2024/05/ecuadors-los-lobos-narcotrafficking-gang-muscles-in-on-illegal-gold-mining/\">illegal logging and gold mining</a>, often in <a href=\"https://www.amazonconservation.org/maap-update-illegal-mining-expands-in-the-ecuadorian-amazon/\">national parks and Indigenous territories</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/05/how-wind-energy-is-reshaping-the-future-of-global-power-and-politics/#:~:text=Wind%20energy%20is%20quickly%20becoming,so%20does%20its%20political%20importance.\">global wind energy boom</a> has also fueled organized crime in Ecuador, which holds large stocks of <a href=\"https://earthjournalism.net/stories/balsa-fever-brought-hope-and-havoc-in-the-amazon-what-happened-next\">balsa</a> (<em>Ochroma pyramidale</em>), the preferred timber for wind turbine blades. Ecuador produces over 90% of the world’s balsa, but booming Chinese demand over the past decade has decimated the country’s stock and spurred <a href=\"https://eia.org/report/ill-wind/\">a wave of illegal logging</a> that’s spilled into Peru.</p><h3>Strategies for Reducing Nature Crime in the Amazon</h3><p>In such a vast, resource-rich and thinly governed region, natural resource crime cannot realistically be eradicated, particularly given the entrenched durability of the trade in cocaine and other illicit drugs. But governments can reduce crime if they work together on deterrence and protect Indigenous People’s territories and rights.</p><h4>Strengthening Cooperation on Nature Crime Among Amazon Nations</h4><p> Nature crime thrives in thinly governed border regions where criminals take advantage of countries’ siloed jurisdictions by border-hopping to conceal crimes and evade capture. States need to cooperate more effectively than they do today to change this situation, particularly in the vulnerable borderlands.</p><p>An August 2023 summit of the heads of state of eight members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) issued the <a href=\"https://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/otca.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Declaration-of-Belem.pdf\">Declaration of Belem</a>, committing signatories to “promote the exchange of information and policy and intelligence cooperation to combat illegal activities and environmental crimes affecting the Amazon region.” Brazil followed up in 2024 by establishing an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-share-intel-technology-with-amazon-nations-manaus-police-hub-2024-01-22/\">international policing and security center </a> in Manaus that will eventually host officers from all ACTO member countries.</p><p>To make good on this commitment, countries need to strengthen and harmonize their laws pertinent to forest crime; increase information-sharing in real time among intelligence agencies, including remote-sensing information; and organize cross-border operations on trafficking in narcotics, timber, gold and wildlife. Cooperation among national financial intelligence units to detect and sanction <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/amazon-countries-are-stepping-up-measures-to-counter-illicit-financing-of-nature-crime-236043\">money laundering and other financial crimes</a> is also critical.</p><p>Brazil has already shown some success in thwarting illegal gold mining in the Yanomami Indigenous Territory that straddles the Venezuelan border. The country launched more than 4,000 suppression operations since 2024, which reduced illegal mining in the territory by <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/secom/en/latest-news/2025/03/government-house-marks-one-year-historic-drop-in-illegal-mining-at-yanomami-indigenous-land\">more than 90% </a> by early 2025.</p><p>Countries also need to strengthen their national legal frameworks. In April 2025, Brazil’s Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-amazon-pantanal-deforestation-supreme-court-3cec1105fefe6a33e097e6c5f575c739\">ordered</a> the federal government to seize private properties where owners cause illegal deforestation or wildfires. Although likely to face appeal, the ruling is a major step towards blocking “regularization,” the process by which illegally cleared and acquired public land in the Amazon becomes legal, a main driver of deforestation. Unfortunately, that same month lawmakers in the Amazon state of Rondônia passed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cattle-deforestation-amazon-rondonia-law-f4e0395c2b1d943bb03da6ad9ee68df9\">legislation granting amnesty</a> to hundreds of cattle ranchers who had illegally cleared rainforest, in direct opposition to the Supreme Court ruling.</p><h4>Effectively Protect Indigenous Rights and Territories</h4><p>Approximately 163.8 million hectares — nearly 20% of the Amazon basin — consists of officially recognized <a href=\"https://www.maapprogram.org/protected-indigenous-amazon/\">Indigenous territories</a>, home to an estimated <a href=\"https://amazonaid.org/resources/about-the-amazon/peoples-of-the-amazon/\">1.5 million people</a> from more than 350 ethnic groups. These areas are comparatively <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151921/indigenous-communities-protect-the-amazon\">better conserved</a> than the rest of the Amazon and are also <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">major carbon sinks</a>. But legal recognition, by itself, is no talisman against invasion. Effective protection requires the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-indigenous-territories-expulsion-lands-amazon-removal-8f4ee1bd8c1b87a90303182c6547500a\">removal — by force if necessary</a> — of non-Indigenous gold miners, loggers, traffickers and other outsiders. Only the state has the legitimate authority to do this. And historically, the state has often come down on <a href=\"https://cimi.org.br/2022/08/cimi-violence-against-indigenous-peoples-report-2021/\">the side of the invaders</a>.</p><p>With valuable resources in the sights of organized criminal gangs, territorial control will remain a struggle, with Indigenous Peoples often on the front lines. Allies can support Indigenous communities in monitoring their territories against incursions and securely reporting intelligence to trusted national and regional enforcement authorities.</p><p>Civil society organizations in Peru have made progress in this area by equipping Indigenous communities with geospatial monitoring tools and training, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015171118\">dramatic decrease in deforestation</a>. Unfortunately, this promising approach was recently undermined by the Peruvian government itself, which <a href=\"https://eia.org/report/carving-up-the-amazon/\">effectively legalized deforestation</a> in the name of “economic development.”</p><p>A more hopeful example comes from <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/03/colombia-creates-landmark-territory-to-protect-uncontacted-indigenous-groups/\">Colombia</a>, which in early 2025 created a one-million-hectare territory to protect isolated Indigenous groups and the pristine forests they inhabit. This follows on a wider process to formally recognize 25 territories of more than 45 Indigenous Peoples as <a href=\"https://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/gaiaamazonas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pager-ETIs-ENG-V1.pdf\">Indigenous Territorial Entities</a>, together covering 36% of the Colombian Amazon.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Blue and gold macaw parrots\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/macaws_0.jpg?VersionId=yeR1Jxn2TN75MCTKyd817cCq.XSPGEJB&itok=-z-CwywO\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Blue and gold macaws are one of many species that call the Amazon rainforest home.

She will play a critical role at the upcoming UN climate summit (COP30) in Belem, Brazil and is a champion of Amazon conservation.</p><p>Then there is <a href=\"https://sumauma.com/en/a-nova-vida-velha-do-homem-que-confessou-ter-matado-chico-mendes/\">Darci Alves Pereira</a>, the man who confessed to murdering Chico Mendes on the orders of his father, a violent land-grabber in the Amazon state of Acre. Father and son were sentenced in 1990 to 19 years in prison, but “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/world/brazilian-sequel-a-jailbreak-a-bitter-widow.html\">escaped</a>” a few years later and, when recaptured, received <a href=\"https://www.americasquarterly.org/blog/marina-silva-and-the-uncertain-legacy-of-chico-mendes/\">early release</a>. By 2024, Alves had changed his name, become an Evangelical preacher, and briefly served as <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-03-06/how-a-small-city-in-the-amazon-reveals-the-strength-of-the-far-right-in-brazil.html\">local head of the political party of Jair Bolsonaro</a>, Brazil’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341507/bolsonaro-brazil-trial-coup-attempt\">former far-right president</a> well-known for his opposition to Amazon conservation and hostility to Indigenous Peoples.</p><p id=\"footnotes\">Many brave souls continue to defend the people and forests championed by Chico Mendes, Marina Silva, Dom Phillips and their compatriots. But the much more organized and powerful criminal successors of the Alves family are still very much with us, creating roadblocks at a time when momentum for forest conservation is needed more than ever. We ignore them at our peril.</p><p class=\"secondary\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\"><sup>1</sup> Under drought conditions, a fire deliberately set to clear one area easily expands to adjacent areas.  “Arson” may intentionally target a certain area, but spread to a much larger territory.

      "description": "<p>Between 2001 and 2024, the world <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/forest-loss-drivers-data-trends\" target=\"_blank\">lost 177 million hectares of tree cover</a> that is likely permanent. Most of this loss was the result of clearing for farms, pastures and tree crop plantations. This daunting number is a wake-up call, underscoring the urgent need for stronger action to curb deforestation for farming and forest degradation from wood production.</p><p>As a major buyer of commodities largely responsible for fueling deforestation — such as palm oil, cocoa, coffee, soy, cattle and timber — the EU has both a responsibility and an opportunity to help shift global markets toward more sustainable supply chains. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), adopted in 2023, requires businesses to demonstrate that the products they sell or export to the EU do not originate from land that was recently deforested or degraded. It is a key step in responding to today’s deforestation and supporting countries in achieving their national policies on protecting forests, such as moratoria on farms or concessions in primary forests or on peat.</p><p>Yet despite its promise, the regulation has faced delays and pushback, threatening its timely implementation. At a time when forests are increasingly under threat, it’s more urgent than ever to understand the regulation and ensure its full and rapid implementation.</p><h3>What Is the EUDR?</h3><p>The EUDR is a landmark law that came into force in June 2023. Its goal is to ensure that certain products sold in or exported to the EU do not come from land that was deforested or degraded after Dec. 31, 2020. The regulation is designed to prevent EU consumer demand from driving further forest loss or damage, while also reducing the region’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity decline.</p><p>The EUDR covers timber and six key agricultural commodities: cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soy, as well as products made from them such as beef, furniture and chocolate. To be sold in or exported from the EU market, these products must meet the following <strong>three conditions</strong>:</p><ol><li>They are <strong>deforestation-free</strong>.</li><li>They have been <strong>produced in compliance with the relevant laws of the country of origin</strong>.</li><li>They are <strong>covered by a due diligence statement</strong>, showing that the company has checked the origin and ensured the products meet EUDR requirements.</li></ol><p>This means businesses must demonstrate that any EUDR-covered commodities were not produced on land <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data/satellite-data-eu-regulation-deforestation-free-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">that was deforested</a> nor did they <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/monitoring-forest-degradation-eudr/\" target=\"_blank\">contribute to forest degradation</a> after the Dec. 31, 2020 cutoff date. Although the regulation is legally in place, companies are not yet required to comply yet. The rules will apply starting from Dec. 30, 2025, for large enterprises and June 30, 2026, for small and medium-sized businesses.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1026\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"821\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"629\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"495\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A graphic that shows the key EUDR development milestones from 2003 to 2026\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/25-7-7-eudr-timeline-v3_0.png?VersionId=yjL36gY4ley7L3GRiiF4CpKNCc0xcqdN&itok=XmopERpJ\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p> </p><h3>Why Is the EUDR important?</h3><p>The EUDR offers a major opportunity for the EU to reduce its role in global deforestation and biodiversity loss, as well as help create deforestation-free supply chains.

In fact, out of 160 agricultural commodities imported by the EU, just six — beef, palm oil, soy, cocoa, coffee and rubber, as covered by the EUDR — made up 58% of the estimated forest loss tied to EU imports.</p><p>By reducing the EU’s forest-loss footprint and tackling deforestation risks in its supply chains, the EUDR could help reverse deforestation worldwide. In 2024, a record 6.7 million hectares of <a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\" target=\"_blank\">primary tropical forests</a> were lost — nearly double the 2023 rate and equivalent of losing 18 soccer fields of forest every minute. While wildfires captured global attention, some of the increase was due to agricultural conversion and logging.</p><h3>What Challenges and Setbacks Has the EUDR Faced?</h3><p>In December 2024, <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/3234/oj/eng\" target=\"_blank\">the EU postponed the start of EUDR </a>compliance by 12 months to give companies more time to prepare to meet the regulation’s requirements. The rules will apply from Dec. 30, 2025, for large enterprises and June 30, 2026, for small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p>In May 2025, the European Commission published the regulation’s <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-implementing-regulation-laying-down-rules-application-deforestation-regulation_en\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarking classification</a> system, which ranks countries as low, standard and high risk based on indicators assessing the deforestation risk linked to commodity production in each country. The ranking system was designed to help businesses and enforcement authorities in the EU to conduct due diligence and enforce compliance. The risk levels indicate the percentage of checks on shipments, with greater scrutiny given to higher-risk countries. </p><p>Now, new proposals call on the EU Commission to revise the benchmarking classification system introduced in 2025. Some EU member state representatives have suggested adding a “no-risk” category to exempt certain countries from due diligence requirements; another suggestion proposed removing the system altogether. But <a href=\"https://www.fern.org/publications-insight/wto-implications-of-the-proposed-no-risk-amendment-to-the-eudr/\" target=\"_blank\">changes like these</a> could <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\">create loopholes and ultimately weaken</a> the regulation’s effectiveness. The European Parliament already <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-amendments-eu-deforestation-law-create-dangerous-loopholes-and-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\">rejected a similar idea in 2024</a> for that very reason.</p><p>The EUDR was agreed upon following a lengthy negotiation between EU institutions and member states, as well as impact assessments and extensive consultations. Derailing its implementation would penalize producer countries and companies that have already invested in compliance, and it would create confusion and uncertainty in the EU market. The regulation may not be perfect, but it’s a necessary step toward deforestation-free supply chains. <a href=\"https://www.cofcointernational.com/newsroom/first-cofco-soymeal-shipment-aligned-with-upcoming-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr-requirements-loads-in-argentina/\" target=\"_blank\">Many companies</a> have already shown that <a href=\"https://www.adm.com/en-us/news/news-releases/2024/7/as-eu-deforestation-regulation-approaches-adm-offers-fully-verified-segregated-traceable-soybean-meal-and-oil-to-european-customers/\" target=\"_blank\">EUDR</a> <a href=\"https://www.danzer.com/en/company/media-relations/danzer-blog/item/we-are-ready-for-the-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr\" target=\"_blank\">compliance</a> is possible, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neumann-kaffee-gruppe_neumannkaffeegruppe-nkg-greencoffee-activity-7341043266814902282-ZxzX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAE1-pABvCIe5Hj5bAjDVEQyxMlfXsVXU2U\" target=\"_blank\">several</a> have urged the EU to uphold the legal text and stick to <a href=\"https://www.tchibo.com/de/de/news/tchibo-fordert-umsetzung-eudr\" target=\"_blank\">implementation timeline</a>.</p><p>Since adoption, the EUDR has faced criticism from both inside and outside the EU. Most concerns focus on cost and complexity of compliance, as well as fairness, particularly for smallholder farmers. In response, the European Commission, EU member states and other development institutions have ramped up investment in <a href=\"https://green-forum.ec.europa.eu/nature-and-biodiversity/deforestation-regulation-implementation_en\" target=\"_blank\">EUDR preparedness</a> by issuing resources and guidance, with a particular emphasis on <a href=\"https://zerodeforestationhub.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">preventing smallholder exclusion from the EU market</a>.</p><h3>What Counts as Deforestation and Degradation Under the EUDR?</h3><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary\">The regulation's <strong>definition of a forest </strong>largely follows the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which defines it as land larger than 0.5 hectares with trees taller than 5 meters and a canopy cover of at least 10% that is not primarily used for farming or urban development.</p></div><p>Under the EUDR, <strong>deforestation</strong> refers to clearing forest to make way for agriculture. The key factor is the conversion of land that was forest in 2020 into farmland — such as pastures or soy plantations. It’s a complete land-use change: the forest is no longer a forest.</p><ul><li>If that forest is cleared — whether by people or natural events like fire — and then converted into farmland, such as pastures for raising cattle or fields for soy or palm oil, it is considered deforestation.</li><li>However, if a forest is cleared, for example by fire (whether from human activity or natural causes) and is <strong>not</strong> used to produce any of the six EUDR-covered agricultural commodities, it is <strong>not </strong>considered deforestation under the regulations.</li><li>Forests used for wood production are not considered deforestation unless they’re also used for agriculture, for example, cattle grazing under the tree canopy.</li></ul><p>The EUDR also covers <strong>degradation</strong>. Land that was forest in 2020 can be used for wood production and remain classified as a forest, even if it’s temporarily unstocked, according to EUDR definitions. A forest used for wood production is not considered degraded unless there's a specific structural change, such as:</p><ul><li>Converting primary forest (native, untouched forest) into other wooded land (trees have 5%-10% canopy cover) or into plantation or planted forest.</li><li>Converting naturally regenerating forest (which has largely grown back on its own) into other wooded land used or plantation forest.</li></ul><h3>Who Does the EUDR Affect?</h3><p>The EUDR affects any company that imports, produces or exports specific products, and their derivatives, to or from the EU market. This includes <strong>operators</strong> (those placing products on the market or exporting them from the market) and <strong>traders</strong> (those distributing and selling products).</p><p>It applies to companies based in the EU and internationally, and to businesses of all sizes, from micro and small enterprises to large corporations. However, larger businesses face stricter reporting requirements than smaller ones.</p><p>The EUDR spans multiple sectors, from food and beverage (such as companies sourcing cocoa and coffee) to fashion (leather goods, for example) to the healthcare industry (products such as latex gloves).</p><h3>How Are Countries and Companies Preparing for the EUDR?</h3><p>Under the EUDR, companies must prove that products linked to deforestation or degradation after Dec. 31, 2020, are not entering the EU market. This requires a due diligence process: collecting supply chain information (including geolocation), assessing the risk of deforestation and taking steps to eliminate any identified risk before the product can be put on the market.</p><h4>Country-level efforts</h4><p>Many producer countries are already taking concrete steps to prepare for the EUDR, from adopting national plans to developing traceability systems and improving data transparency. For example, Indonesia, Ghana and Vietnam are investing in government-led efforts to make information available to companies that must comply with the regulation. Delaying enforcement or altering the regulation’s scope could undermine these leading producer countries.</p><p>Vietnam stands out as a strong example of how the EUDR is reinforcing national policies to combat deforestation. As a top exporter of rubber and coffee, the country has shifted its focus from illegal logging to broader deforestation risks in agriculture since the regulation’s introduction.  In 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development adopted a <a href=\"https://www.4c-services.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/02.-Nguyen-Nhu-Cuong_Action-Plan-for-the-compliance-with-EUDR-of-Viet-Nam.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">national action plan</a> prioritizing sustainable agricultural transformation. The following year, it launched a traceability system for coffee farms, piloting geospatial verification (such as satellite images) in key producing provinces. Developed through <a href=\"https://idh.org/news/vietnams-coffee-sector-marks-a-landmark-step-towards-sustainability-launching-the-eudr-database-system-for-forest-and-coffee-growing-areas\" target=\"_blank\">public-private collaboration</a>, the system cross-references land-use maps and cadastral data to ensure EUDR compliance. Plans are also underway to expand it to rubber and cocoa.</p><p>Vietnam’s progress shows how the regulation can act as a catalyst for stronger policy alignment between global market demands and local sustainability goals. </p><p>EU member states are also preparing by using satellite and aerial earth observation data, such as forest maps from 2020 (the EUDR cutoff year) to detect deforestation, alongside other monitoring solutions and tools to support compliant imports. </p><h4>Private-sector efforts</h4><p>Companies across supply chains are ramping up EUDR preparations, sparking a wave of innovation in monitoring and traceability. Many are developing satellite-based systems to verify deforestation-free sourcing, training smallholder farmers to meet EUDR requirements and partnering with governments and NGOs to improve data sharing and risk assessment.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.meridia.land/case/unilevers-smallholder-hub-programme\" target=\"_blank\">Unilever and Meridia</a> are working together to map smallholder farmers in Indonesia, making it possible to trace palm oil from plantation to mill. <a href=\"https://sustainablenaturalrubber.org/annual-report-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">The Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR)</a> has created a system to help companies follow sustainability practices and demonstrate EUDR compliance. Open-source platforms like WRI’s Global Forest Watch are also <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/satellite-data-eu-regulation-deforestation-free-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">supporting companies in verifying supply chains</a>.</p><p>These efforts from governments, companies and EU countries show how the EUDR is already driving unprecedented action — transforming compliance from a burden into an opportunity to build more responsible and transparent supply chains. The challenge now is scaling these solutions across all commodities and regions.</p><h3>What's Next for the EUDR?</h3><p>The EUDR represents a major milestone in the fight against commodity-driven deforestation.</p><p>The EU must reject attempts to weaken the regulation’s core requirements. Its effectiveness depends on maintaining its ambition without dilution or delay. Backtracking at this stage would undermine the EUDR’s credibility and send the wrong signal to global markets. </p><p>At the same time, the EU should also step up efforts to provide clear guidance to businesses, along with practical training and support to help them develop the skills needed for compliance, especially for small businesses that may otherwise struggle to meet requirements.</p><p id=\"footnotes\">The European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States should stay the course and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-proposed-changes-threaten-effectiveness-eu-deforestation-regulation\" target=\"_blank\">deliver the EUDR as planned</a>. It is not only a necessary response to the crisis of forest loss, but also a vital tool to support and complement producer country efforts to halt deforestation by 2030.</p><p class=\"secondary\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\"><sup>1</sup>Timber and timber products are not included.</p>",

In October 2024, Tata Steel shut down the blast furnaces with a plan, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9rd54dk24o\">supported by a 500 million pound (approximately $660 million) government grant</a>, to replace them with a lower-polluting electric arc furnace installation.</p><p>However, this shift will result in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70zxjldqnxo\">2,800 layoffs</a> of workers with specialized knowledge and skills that are not easily transferable.

But shifting U.S. policy priorities and waning investment have since blurred the future for clean industrial projects like this one.</p><p>In 2024, Cleveland-Cliffs was selected to receive up to $500 million from the Department of Energy through its Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP). The funding would have been used to replace one of its coal-powered blast furnaces with a less emissions-intensive <a href=\"https://www.metallics.org/dri-production.html\">direct reduced iron plant</a>, which was expected to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 1 million tons per year, while also reducing toxic pollution to Middletown’s air and water.

Historically, fenceline communities — people who live near industrial facilities, which are often made up of residents from low-income backgrounds or communities of color — have long faced <a href=\"https://peri.umass.edu/publication/regional-variation-in-environmental-inequality-industrial-air-toxics-exposure-in-u-s-cities/\">disproportionate pollution exposure</a> and shouldered the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf4491\">public health burden</a> of these industries.</p><p>Many fenceline communities exist today because of intentional government policies and practices, such as <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c01012\">redlining</a> and racially discriminatory zoning and disinvestment, which forced economically marginalized and politically excluded groups to live in what’s become known as \"<a href=\"https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sacrifice-zones\">sacrifice zones</a>.\" This reflects patterns of historic underinvestment and environmental harm imposed on economically and socially marginalized populations.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1046\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"837\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"641\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"505\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"302\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Houses in front of a factory.\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/fenceline-communities_0.jpg?VersionId=KbABoMWlYZtwuOkaKp25I_CcZvP3Mbqm&itok=FKVzjn7F\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Fenceline communities are neighborhoods next to industrial facilities that experience direct exposure to its pollutants.

When communities are engaged meaningfully early on, policies and projects are more likely to earn public trust, avoid local opposition and secure the long-term support needed to sustain industrial transitions. Furthermore, such a shift can create economic <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25931/chapter/6\">benefits</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/health-equity-economic-impact.html\">reducing health care costs</a> from improved air quality and fostering public and worker support for decarbonization initiatives, which are essential for durably scaling these efforts.</p><p>The shift away from fossil fuels has often failed to fully consider the needs of affected workers and fenceline communities. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ca-oil-refineries-just-transition\">thousands of refinery workers could be left stranded</a> as California phases down its petroleum refining. Beyond a handful of refinery-specific initiatives, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-is-just-transition-tracking-progress\">just transition planning</a> across the broader industrial landscape — particularly in steel, cement and chemicals — remains scarce.</p><p>If today’s industrial modernization and decarbonization efforts ignore workers, communities and environmental impacts, they could repeat past mistakes of accelerating plant closures without offering alternative economic opportunities, concentrating environmental risks in fenceline communities, eroding community trust and potentially delaying or canceling projects.</p><h3>The Economic Case for a People-Centered Transition</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-economic-transformation-what-would-change-in-the-net-zero-transition\">Recent analysis from McKinsey & Company</a> estimates that an economy-wide net-zero transition by 2050 could lead to 200 million new direct and indirect jobs while also causing a loss of 185 million jobs — resulting in a net gain of 15 million jobs worldwide by 2050. Without a well-managed transition, industrial decarbonization could result in local job losses and economic disruption.</p><p>Beyond avoiding the <a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/the-cost-of-inaction/\">substantial economic risks and losses from climate change</a>, modernizing U.S. industry in a way that prioritizes workers and communities <a href=\"https://businesswest.com/blog/sublime-systems-advances-manufacturing-tradition-in-holyoke/\">can help revive historic manufacturing regions</a>, attract investment and boost their economic prosperity. And at the same time, it would allow the U.S. to capitalize on deploying innovative new industrial technologies.</p><p>As the global economy shifts toward cleaner and more efficient manufacturing, innovative industrial production methods that utilize cleaner energy sources will become <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-next-frontier-in-american-industrial-policy-saving-the-steel-industry-by-decarbonizing-it/\">better positioned to compete globally</a><u>.</u> And as <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/tax/esg-tax/cbam-supply-chain-imperatives.html\">global markets</a> and <a href=\"https://rmi.org/press-release/major-corporations-come-together-to-advance-the-first-commercial-batch-of-sustainable-steel-in-the-us/\">private sector buyers</a> start prioritizing lower-carbon industrial products, U.S. government policies such as subsidies and technology demonstration grants are needed to proactively drive industrial innovation and ensure domestic industries don’t fall behind in a rapidly changing market.</p><p>At the same time, successful decarbonization projects will depend not only on market shifts and technological advancements, but also on how people are included. When the needs of workers, fenceline communities and local stakeholders are not addressed as part of transitions, companies risk encountering public opposition, costly legal challenges, project delays or cancellations, and increased costs associated with those risks, slowing progress.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/01/labour-warned-risks-losing-support-net-zero-costs-not-spread-fairly?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">some experts</a> have warned that if the financial and social burdens of the clean-industry shift — such as higher energy rates or job losses — fall disproportionately on lower-income households, workers or fenceline communities while benefits accrue elsewhere, public support for net-zero initiatives could erode, making it harder to pass and implement effective policies. And, while they recognize industry’s negative impact on air and water pollution, many members of fenceline communities rank <a href=\"https://ceepr.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-Roosevelt-Project-Iron-and-Steel-Decarbonization-by-2050.pdf\">economic considerations like job security as a far higher priority</a> than local environmental well-being in surveys.</p><p>Fortunately for both industrial communities and the broader economy, environmental well-being and economic well-being are not mutually exclusive. For example, in the U.S., <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/clean-investment-monitor-tallying-the-two-year-impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act/\"> past policies that directed clean energy investments toward historically marginalized communities</a> sought to support workforce transitions and strengthen declining local economies.</p><h3>Strategies for Inclusive and Resilient Industrial Decarbonization</h3><p>To support responsible and equitable industrial decarbonization that aligns with economic opportunity and long-term community resilience, policymakers and developers should consider several strategies:</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ca-oil-refineries-just-transition\">Create Industry Transition Roadmaps</a></td><td style=\"border-style: none;\">Industry roadmaps that combine modernization pathways with steps for workforce transition can help policymakers proactively create long-term reskilling and job placement strategies when retrofitting, replacing and retiring heavy-polluting industrial facilities.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-workforce-ready-energy-transition\">Invest in Workforce Training and Reskilling</a></td><td><p>Decarbonization should be paired with reskilling initiatives, wage protections, and local hiring mandates to minimize job displacement.<br /> </p><p>Targeted investments in vocational training, apprenticeship programs and STEM education can equip workers with the skills needed for new, clean industry jobs.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/community-benefits-frameworks-database-takeaways\">Prioritize Community Benefits</a></td><td><p>Community benefit plans or agreements, participatory planning processes and local advisory boards ensure fenceline communities have a key role in shaping industrial projects.<br /> </p><p>Developers and policymakers should engage communities early and consistently to increase transparency and trust in new decarbonization efforts.<br /> </p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/managing-energy-economic-and-environmental-transition-workshop-report\">Balance Environmental and Economic Priorities</a></td><td><p>Industrial decarbonization strategies should simultaneously advance local pollution reduction and environmental remediation, energy affordability and job creation.<br /> </p><p>Policies should avoid short-term economic disruptions by pairing emissions reductions measures with incentives for the use and reuse of recently closed or declining industrial sites for clean manufacturing, energy efficiency, and infrastructure investment.<br /> </p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/regulating-DAC-CCS-safety\">Ensure Environmental and Worker Safety in Industrial Shifts</a></td><td>Conduct cumulative impact assessments to ensure that decarbonization technologies (e.g., hydrogen, carbon capture and storage) do not introduce health or safety risks for workers and nearby communities.<br /><br />Strengthening worker safety regulations and health protections ensures that industrial shifts do not lead to new forms of harm.<br /> </td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://usddpp.org/community-engagement-the-key-to-successful-decarbonization/\">Embed Community Trust and Protective Safeguards</a></td><td>Require every project to offer two-way engagement forums (listening sessions, advisory boards, co-design workshops) that communities can join if they choose.<br /><br />Establish anti-displacement safeguards (e.g., property-tax relief, affordable-housing set-asides) to prevent gentrification as new projects raise land values.<br /> </td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Carrying Momentum Forward Amid Federal Rollbacks</h3><p>In recent years, the U.S. federal government made considerable progress toward a more equitable transition to a low-carbon economy. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-justice40-initiative\">Justice40 Initiative</a> sought to ensure that some of the economic gains and environmental benefits of climate investments flowed to economically marginalized and environmentally overburdened communities. Incentives like the <a href=\"https://energycommunities.gov/energy-community-tax-credit-bonus/\">Energy Community Tax Credit Bonus</a> were designed to help preserve jobs in regions historically dependent on fossil fuel industries.</p><p>However, many of these efforts at the federal level have been scaled back, weakened or eliminated in the first half of 2025. These rollbacks not only disadvantage communities and workers but could also create uncertainty for companies that may rely on stable incentives and local support.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Recent News: Nippon Steel Acquires U.S. Steel</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Federal regulators <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/06/18/steel-nippon-golden-share-trump/\">approved</a> Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel on June 18, 2025, contingent on a national security “golden share” that lets federal officials block plant closures and other moves. Community and labor advocates warn that, without binding, enforceable guarantees for worker protections, meaningful community participation, and a shift to low-carbon steelmaking, the deal could jeopardize union jobs and lock in coal-based production — along with the <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2025/05/nippon-steel-acquisition-us-steel-must-address-local-community-concerns\">$7 billion to $13 billion</a> in annual health costs it already imposes on frontline neighborhoods.</p></div><p>In the absence of strong federal direction, state and local governments and forward-looking companies will need to take the lead on responsible and fair decarbonization. <a href=\"https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/how-states-are-centering-workers-in-the-clean-energy-transition\">Several states</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CO-Just-Transition.pdf\">Colorado</a> and <a href=\"https://epa.illinois.gov/topics/ceja.html\">Illinois</a>, have implemented workforce transition funds, targeting clean industrial investments that prioritize job retention and local economic benefits. Industry leaders can also adopt voluntary commitments that strengthen public trust and reduce project risks, such as prioritizing U.S.-based supply chains to avoid <a href=\"https://clear.ucdavis.edu/news/what-carbon-leakage\">carbon leakage</a>, investing in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/electric-vehicle-training-programs-trends\">worker training</a>, and engaging with host communities early and consistently to develop <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/clean-energy-community-benefits-agreements\">community benefits frameworks</a>. These strategies go beyond good public relations — they also avoid delays, legal challenges and reputational damage.  </p><p>Industrial modernization and decarbonization are not merely about cutting emissions — they are about building a more resilient, competitive and inclusive economy that benefits both industry and the communities that sustain it. By implementing fair and responsible policies and practices that recognize the value of workers and communities, the U.S. manufacturing can position itself toward long-term success in a rapidly changing global economy.</p>",

      "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>RIO DE JANEIRO (July 7, 2025) </strong>— The 2025 BRICS Summit concluded today in Rio de Janeiro, bringing together representatives from countries including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa to advance a coordinated agenda on economic development, geopolitical cooperation and climate action. </span> </p><p><a href=\"https://brics.br/en/documents/presidency-documents/250705-brics-leaders-declaration-en.pdf/@@download/file\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><u>Among the outcomes</u></span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\"> were calls for strengthened climate finance, improved carbon accounting and the creation of a developing country–led platform to align trade with sustainability goals. The summit also highlighted the role of technology transfer and resilience-building as integral to a more equitable global economy. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Following is a statement from Mirela Sandrini, Interim Executive Director, WRI Brazil:</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“This year’s BRICS Summit sends the clearest signal yet that major emerging economies can step into a global leadership role to address the climate crisis. Spanning finance, trade, technology and resilience-building, the summit’s outcome underscores strong support for climate action from the countries gathered in Rio – even as the United States retreats.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“It is encouraging that BRICS nations called for more climate lending, deeper green bond markets and better carbon accounting – and created a new developing country-led platform to align trade with sustainability. Their commitment to protect tropical forests and scale up adaptation is a notable step towards safeguarding nature, building resilience and supporting human well-being. The specific mention of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility adds weight to that commitment. Crucially, they endorsed putting people and equity at the heart of a just transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“South-South collaboration of this scale and ambition can inject much-needed momentum into international climate diplomacy ahead of COP30. But a key test will be how BRICS countries implement climate commitments at home – from cutting emissions and building resilience, to supporting other developing nations through investment and lesson-sharing. Most importantly, the world will be watching for their new national climate commitments due by September, ahead of COP30. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Brazil deserves credit for bringing the BRICS together behind a more assertive vision for climate action. Brazil is deftly weaving climate diplomacy into the fabric of broader global agendas – from its G20 Presidency to BRICS and soon the COP30 summit.  This integrated approach helps reduce fragmentation across international fora and positions climate policy as a cornerstone of global economic and financial reform – driving the inclusive, green growth the world urgently needs.”</span> </p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>WASHINGTON D.C. (July 3, 2025)</strong> — Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R.1., the Republican budget bill, by a vote of 218 to 214 following the U.S. Senate’s 51 to 50 vote passage earlier this week. </p><p>The new law turns back the clock on America’s clean energy leadership, with provisions such as the rapid phaseout of critical wind and solar tax credits and introduction of onerous Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, rendering many clean energy investments unworkable or uncertain at best. Taken together, these provisions will raise Americans’ electricity bills, <a href=\"https://energyinnovation.org/report/one-big-beautiful-bill-act/\">eliminate </a>hundreds of thousands of jobs, <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/ways-and-means-brings-the-hammer-down-on-energy-credits/\">decimate </a>investments in U.S. manufacturing, and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-is-crushing-americas-electricity-system/\">undermine </a>the ability to meet rapidly growing demand for electricity.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Dr. David Widawsky, Director, WRI US:</strong></p><p>“While other countries are benefitting from accelerated investment in the clean energy economy, the U.S. is taking a step backwards.</p><p>“H.R.1. will undercut the Administration’s stated goal of ‘unleashing American energy’ and sends a chilling signal to families, businesses and investors alike. Abruptly phasing out clean energy tax credits will raise costs, slow innovation and jeopardize America’s energy security.</p><p>“Electricity demand is growing everywhere—and growing fast. The clean energy cuts in this bill will increase costs and constrain supply at a time when demand for electricity is surging. Working families, business owners and local governments will bear the brunt through higher electricity bills, fewer jobs, and reduced energy resilience to extreme weather. Billions of dollars of investment in infrastructure, manufacturing, energy savings will be lost; failure to keep pace with growing energy demand will make brownouts and blackouts more likely; air will become less breathable; and American economic growth will be at risk.</p><p>“Fossil fuels alone won’t meet the skyrocketing energy demand from manufacturing, AI, electrification, and increasingly frequent and intense heat waves that prompt more AC usage. But America can create a more flexible, agile, and resilient power system with renewables and grid upgrades. Clean energy sources are better positioned to come online quickly to meet growing electricity needs and spur economic growth. That’s exactly what companies, state and local governments, utilities and families have been counting on, planning for and investing in.</p><p>“Many Americans remain committed to a clean energy future—and we expect to see progress from the cities, states and businesses that have become labs for innovation in recent years. While this bill throws up many roadblocks to progress, these innovators can and must continue driving the country’s energy economy forward. Opportunities remain for them to do so through coalition building, providing innovative financing and policy solutions, and facilitating infrastructure development for critical projects that serve their communities.</p><p>We simply can’t afford to double down on outdated energy sources and policies. Despite this setback, we are not going to give up the race for the secure, affordable and innovative power system that Americans need – and deserve.”</p>",
