      "description": "<p>Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are the future of the automotive industry, both globally and in the United States. Approximately <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/us-passenger-ev-sales-and-model-availability-through-2024-apr25/\">1.56 million electric vehicles</a> (including BEVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles, with BEVs dominating sales) were sold in the U.S. in 2024, representing 10% of all light-duty vehicle sales. The U.S. has passed the BEV \"<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/electric-cars-pass-adoption-tipping-point-in-31-countries\">tipping point</a>,\" after which demand is expected to grow from niche market to broader adoption by consumers. Growth has continued even in this year's turbulent policy environment: Over <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/q3-2025-ev-sales-report-commentary/\">438,000 electric vehicles</a> were sold in the United States in the third quarter of 2025 as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring federal tax credit — a 41% increase over the previous quarter and a 30% increase year over year.</p><p>Driven by advancements in battery technology, expanding production volumes and a global shift toward electrification, BEVs are an increasingly attractive alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This shift is not just shaping the future of transportation; it also has profound implications for the workers manufacturing those vehicles.</p><p>Yet while there is growing awareness around how the transition from ICEVs to BEVs could impact automotive manufacturing workers, many questions remain: What are the vulnerable occupations in ICEV manufacturing, and how can those workers transition to new opportunities? What new occupations and skills in BEV manufacturing will be in demand? And how does the transition impact other workforce considerations, such as job quality, location, workforce inclusivity and diversity?</p><p>A <a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wri.org%2Fresearch%2Fus-automotive-manufacturing-workers-transition-battery-electric-vehicles-assessment-impact&data=05%7C02%7CMargaret.Overholt%40wri.org%7Cb2613ef9c55b4f8b4c3608de216ed101%7C476bac1f36b24ad98699cda6bad1f862%7C0%7C0%7C638984957037152277%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=kuoAPue2H8jTQkxzrG5833jJWIeaQm25OFKsHPbHEwE%3D&reserved=0\">new WRI report</a> answers these questions. It clarifies what policies and investments will be needed to develop a diverse and skilled BEV manufacturing workforce while ensuring the transition doesn't leave vulnerable ICEV manufacturing workers behind. The findings drew upon analysis of labor market data, a survey of automotive manufacturing employers, and stakeholder interviews. Here, we present the key findings from the report.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Survey of Automotive Manufacturing Employers</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">The survey referenced here was conducted between May and August 2024 to gather better understanding of industry perceptions, needs and priorities for the BEV transition. To qualify for this survey, respondents had to be involved with the manufacturing or design of finished or component goods for light-duty BEVs and EV battery packs or materials. The survey resulted in 330 complete responses.</p></div><h3>1) Workers in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing will face <em>significant disruption</em>. But even the most vulnerable workers in this field may have opportunities to transition into battery manufacturing and adjacent industries.</h3><p>Workers in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing represent 7% of workers in original equipment manufacturers (OEMs, which design, assemble and sell the final vehicles) and Tier 1 industries (companies that provide parts to OEMs). These workers manufacture components like pistons, crankshafts, cylinder heads and fuel injection systems that go into ICEV engines and are absent from BEV production.</p><p>An estimated 65% of workers in OEMs and Tier 1 automotive manufacturing will face moderate impacts due to differences in manufacturing processes for ICEVs and BEVs. For instance, the braking system and transmission of BEVs differ from ICEVs, and traditional automotive manufacturing workers will need to adapt their skills to work in the BEV industry. The remaining workers in OEMs and Tier 1 industries will face minimal disruption due to minor or no differences in manufacturing processes. For instance, the steering system is similar in both ICEVs and BEVs.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1306\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1045\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"800\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"630\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"377\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart representing the share of auto manufacturing workers at risk during the EV transition.\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/at-risk-auto-manufacturing-jobs-wri_0.png?VersionId=P6CVmI.wgzlpgMFq1BI4PjCjMg585OV4&itok=QF3dOhfz\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Focusing on the most vulnerable workers within gasoline engine manufacturing, our analysis finds that proactive reskilling efforts can enable those workers to transition to emerging roles within battery manufacturing and adjacent industries (such as electronics, software or data management) that require similar skillsets. Some occupations are common to both gasoline engine and battery manufacturing. These occupations share foundational, transferrable skills, though differences remain due to industry-specific knowledge and requirements. For instance, <em>team assemblers</em> assemble various gasoline engine components within gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing; in battery manufacturing, they assemble battery components according to specifications and ensure quality control. Similarly, computer numerically controlled (CNC) tool operators are needed in both types of manufacturing. In gasoline engine manufacturing, CNC operators make precise components like engine blocks, pistons and other parts, while in battery manufacturing, they produce critical pieces of machinery or components used in the assembly of batteries.</p><p>Our analysis finds that if retraining efforts are prioritized, some of the most vulnerable workers in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing could find employment in similar occupations within battery manufacturing. By 2032, for instance, new team assembler jobs in battery manufacturing could potentially offset 63% of those lost in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing.</p><h4>Transitioning vulnerable workers in gasoline engine manufacturing to similar occupations in battery manufacturing</h4><table class=\"table tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th><strong>Vulnerable workers in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing</strong></th><th><strong>Current employment in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing</strong> <strong>(Thousands)</strong></th><th><strong>Estimated battery jobs by 2032</strong> <strong>(Thousands)</strong></th><th><strong>Share of existing jobs met by new battery jobs (%)</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Team Assemblers</strong></td><td>12.4</td><td>7.8</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assemblers and Fabricators, All Other</strong></td><td>1.5</td><td>1.0</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cutting, Punching and Press Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic</strong></td><td>3.3</td><td>0.7</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Operators</strong></td><td>0.9</td><td>0.6</td><td>76</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong><sup>Note:</sup></strong><sup> Percentages in column 4 may seem off because employment numbers here are presented in thousands. </sup><strong><sup>Source: </sup></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/us-automotive-manufacturing-workers-transition-battery-electric-vehicles-assessment-impact\"><em><sup>US Automotive Manufacturing Workers in the Transition to Battery Electric Vehicles</sup></em></a></p><p>In addition, vulnerable ICEV manufacturing workers can potentially transition to new occupations in battery manufacturing and adjacent industries with similar knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs). Our analysis looked at differences in wages between the vulnerable occupations in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing, and occupations in battery manufacturing and adjacent industries with similar KSAs and that are expected to see employment growth. We found that the new occupations generally provide higher wages.</p><p>One contributing factor could be that these jobs require more specialized technical skills in comparison to the mechanically intensive production occupations within gasoline engine manufacturing. There is significant overlap in skills between team assemblers and electrical, electronic and electromechanical equipment assemblers. In particular, they share foundational assembly skills, including proficiency in the use of tools, manual dexterity and precision, and the ability to read technical drawings and blueprints. While this means that transitioning to these similar occupations is possible, it will require upskilling for greater technical expertise or machine operation skills.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"transitioning-vulnerable-workers-table\"><h4>Transitioning vulnerable workers in gasoline engine manufacturing to growth occupations in battery manufacturing and adjacent industries with similar KSAs</h4><table border=\"1\" class=\"table tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th rowspan=\"2\"><strong>Vulnerable occupations in gasoline engine and engine parts manufacturing</strong><sup>a</sup></th><th rowspan=\"2\"><strong>Occupations in battery manufacturing and adjacent industries with growth potential</strong><sup>b</sup></th><th rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>10-year projected economy-wide employment of growth occupations</strong></p><p><strong>(% change) </strong></p></th><th colspan=\"3\"><p><strong>Wage comparison between occupations in column 2 and occupations in column 1</strong></p><p> </p></th></tr><tr><th><strong>Average annual wage</strong></th><th><strong>Median wage</strong></th><th><strong>75th percentile wage</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong> Team Assemblers</strong></td><td rowspan=\"3\">Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical Equipment Assemblers, Except Coil Winders, Tapers, and Finishers</td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.6</p></td><td><strong>↑</strong></td><td><strong>↑</strong></td><td><strong>↑</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Engine and Other Machine Assemblers</strong></td><td><strong>↓</strong></td><td><strong>↓</strong></td><td><strong>↓</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assemblers and Fabricators, All Other</strong></td><td><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>↑</strong></p></td><td><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>↑</strong></p></td><td><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>↑</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cutting, Punching, and Press Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic</strong></td><td>Multiple Machine Tool Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic</td><td><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.2</p></td><td><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>=</strong></p></td><td><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>=</strong></p></td><td><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>↑</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Operators</strong></td><td>Welders, Cutters, Solderers, and Brazers</td><td><p> </p><p>2.4</p></td><td><strong>↑</strong></td><td><strong>↑</strong></td><td><strong>↑</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong><sup>Notes:</sup></strong><sup> KSA = knowledge, skills, and abilities. a.

The emphasis must be on providing support and retraining for dislocated workers, and developing upskilling programs that help workers address gaps in their knowledge and skills for new technologies associated with BEVs.</p><h3>2) There's a geographic mismatch between areas where ICEV manufacturing jobs are being lost and where new BEV manufacturing jobs are emerging. This requires proactive efforts to align ICEV workforce skills with evolving industry needs.</h3><p>BEV manufacturing is growing in traditional automotive manufacturing powerhouses, such as Michigan. It is also growing in states with newly developed automotive manufacturing clusters, such as Georgia. Transitioning workers from ICEV to BEV manufacturing within the same factory, county or even state may be relatively seamless, while workers in some states might face greater challenges due to geography. Even if there are new BEV manufacturing opportunities available for ICEV workers, those opportunities may require relocation alongside investments in reskilling efforts. Factors such as family and community ties, housing affordability and other preferences may lead to displaced or at-risk workers wanting to remain in their current locations. Studies on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41133-9\">other industry transitions</a> have shown a significant mismatch, where a vast majority of workers do not transition to new jobs in different locations, even when their skills theoretically align.</p><p>Proactive reskilling and geographically targeted initiatives will be critical to address these challenges. This can include tailoring transition support and policies to ICEV manufacturing workers most likely to be impacted by the transition. <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/leo/bureaus-agencies/economic-transition\">Michigan's Community & Worker Economic Transition Office</a>, for instance, is providing targeted transition support to Michiganders navigating shifts in the automotive and energy sectors.</p><p>State and local governments should also prioritize the creation of economic and workforce development initiatives to support new industries in regions that are most prone to displacement of ICEV manufacturing workers. In addition to battery manufacturing, states can strategically invest in broader transportation and advanced manufacturing industries — such as aerospace, robotics, automation, advanced materials and semiconductors — which significantly overlap with the skills, technologies and supply chain needs of BEV manufacturing. For instance, <a href=\"https://workforce.ohio.gov/initiatives/initiatives/aam-workforce/aam-landing-page\">Accelerating Ohio's Auto & Advanced Mobility Workforce Strategy</a> is built on attracting the broader automotive, aviation, aerospace and advanced mobility industries to Ohio. Significant investment in training programs will be required to bridge the specific skills gaps between ICEV manufacturing workers and other growth industries, which often include more digital technology-related skills, data management and automation knowledge.</p><h3>3) In addition to BEV-specific skills, workers in BEV manufacturing will require knowledge about managing automated processes.</h3><p>Automation is significantly impacting automotive manufacturing. Regardless of the pace of BEV adoption, upgrading workers' knowledge, as well as their ability to manage and troubleshoot more computerized or automated manufacturing processes, is a top priority for automotive manufacturers. At the same time, the BEV transition is accelerating automation to support new manufacturing processes, such as battery assembly and electric motor manufacturing. For instance, battery assembly entails high levels of accuracy and repeatability for placing individual cells, modules and other components, making it a highly attractive area for automation. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and big data are used to optimize battery design and predict maintenance needs, linking the need for automated systems knowledge with BEV-specific knowledge.</p><p>More than half of surveyed automotive manufacturing firms responded that new hires generally require <em>many </em>additional BEV-specific knowledge and skills, while 38% of respondents noted that new hires require <em>some</em> additional knowledge and skills. When asked what new knowledge or skills are required, 17% of respondents identified proficiency in the use of computer systems, AI and robotics as the most needed skill for workers in BEV manufacturing. Other skills in high demand are those related to knowledge of advanced manufacturing processes and safety procedures; mechanical and electrical systems; and battery technology.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1185\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"948\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"726\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"572\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Graphic showing the knowledge and skills required for EV manufacturing workers.\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/knowledge-skills-bev-manufacturing-wri_0.png?VersionId=BjYHY9VKox.DawiVeuE3q._VmQezd9xh&itok=5L_4DivU\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Training programs must adapt to these changes. This means offering compelling workforce programs that <em>1) </em>integrate hands-on robotics and AI training into BEV manufacturing curricula, and <em>2)</em> emphasize data literacy and technical skills. State agencies, educational institutions and training providers should work with employers and industry associations to reskill and upskill current automotive workers and attract new workers for roles that align with the specific needs of the BEV industry. Funding can be targeted toward short-term credentials and industry-focused programs that integrate these necessary skills. Providing sustained and strategic investment in employer-based apprenticeship programs that offer \"earn-and-learn\" opportunities can also support the automotive industry as it updates its manufacturing lines to expand into BEV production.</p><h3>4) There is a significant need to ramp up and spread training programs as the automotive industry transitions toward BEVs.</h3><p>Automotive manufacturing firms are already investing significantly in training programs to upskill and reskill incumbent workers as well as train prospective workers. But there is much room for improvement across the industry. Nearly 48% of automotive manufacturing firms that responded to the survey directly offer training programs for both incumbent and prospective workers. Among these firms, over half offer on-the-job training programs, and 17% offer internships, apprenticeships or boot camps.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1152\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"922\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"706\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"556\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"333\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart representing survey data that shows whether and how auto manufacturers are providing training to help workers transition to EV jobs.\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/auto-manufacturers-bev-workforce-training-wri_0.png?VersionId=2YDeNeI47Pino3yidsNrD2mWdgakHI1H&itok=4yak_pgl\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Only one in four firms have established formal partnerships with state agencies or local training or educational institutions to address their workforce training needs.

Many small and medium-sized (SME) firms, which constitute the majority of automotive manufacturing companies, face significant barriers that limit their investments in upskilling and reskilling workers. These challenges can include financial and resource constraints, inability to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, lack of awareness about the relationship between training investment and long-term business success, and lack of access to programs tailored to the unique needs of SMEs.</p><p>Moreover, existing economic and workforce development policies often fail to adequately support or provide incentives for SMEs to engage in training new or existing workers. This contributes to a growing skills gap in the U.S. automotive sector, which could hurt the industry's global competitiveness. Governments, along with other partners, can support SMEs through a combination of financial incentives, customized training programs, and reduced administrative burden associated with applying for and managing training funds. State economic development agencies can provide matching grants or job creation tax credits to reduce the cost of training for businesses.</p><p>While larger firms can more easily build a pipeline of workers through apprenticeship programs, SMEs may struggle to do the same due to limited resources. This could be addressed by directing state funds to create an apprenticeship program for a consortium of smaller companies with similar training needs. Intermediaries could handle the administration and logistics of establishing an apprenticeship program, as well as engage with educational providers on behalf of the consortium to create structured on-the-job training for apprentices at each company.</p><h3>5) The BEV transition is mostly seen as an opportunity by the automotive industry. Employers view the transition as a reallocation of workers and resources, rather than an outright displacement.</h3><p>This survey was conducted in 2024, before President Trump took office and his administration made significant rollbacks to U.S. federal clean energy policy. With that said, over half of the automotive manufacturers surveyed see the transition to BEVs as an opportunity. Only 1 in 10 identified the transition as a \"threat,\" and approximately 1 in 4 stated there would be trade-offs. The survey also revealed that automotive manufacturers which have not yet shifted to offering BEV products are more likely to feel threatened. Manufacturers only producing ICEV or hybrid vehicle products and subcomponents see the transition as a threat at a rate more than 2 times higher than manufacturers already producing BEV products and subcomponents.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1025\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"820\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"628\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"495\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"296\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Chart representing survey data that shows auto manufacturers' perception of the shift to EVs.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/auto-industry-perspectives-bev-transition-wri_0.png?VersionId=Vye.cC5LasJC5BM.LKsFrEaofCVZTQtE&itok=uuGo5z1f\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/business/automakers-ev-plans\">Recent news</a> indicates that automotive manufacturers remain optimistic about the long-term future of the transition in the United States, but with a more cautious approach in the short term. With the federal government backtracking, it is even more crucial for U.S. states to continue sending strong market signals to the industry — and to support consumer adoption where possible by building robust charging infrastructure and providing incentives and rebates. After the elimination of the federal $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of a qualifying new electric vehicle, some <a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/governor/news/polis-administration-announces-increased-incentives-electric-vehicles\">state</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sanjoseca.gov/Home/Components/News/News/6895/4699#:~:text=**Eligibility**%20*%20Vehicle%20must%20be%20priced%20under,have%20the%20opportunity%20to%20save%20even%20more\">local governments</a> are increasing consumer incentives for buying them. Strategies like this can help sustain a positive outlook for the U.S. BEV industry.</p><h3>Immediate and Proactive Workforce Planning Is Essential</h3><p>Any transition from one technology to another takes place over multiple years or decades. During this time, there are periods of acceleration and periods of slower growth due to shifting policy changes and other market forces.</p><p>The move toward BEVs is no exception. This transition is already underway and here to stay, making immediate and proactive workforce planning essential to navigate job shifts, address skills gaps and ensure an equitable transition for workers.</p><p>Although automotive manufacturers are primarily responsible for training their workforce, government agencies and educational and training institutions are pivotal partners in building a BEV-ready workforce.

Adaptation activities, such as building resilient infrastructure, are expected to be a major source of employment as well, generating an estimated <strong>280 million jobs</strong> worldwide.</p><p>Realizing the potential for new jobs will require unprecedented coordination among governments, business and international financial institutions. The new analysis sets out an Action Agenda across three key pillars:</p><ul><li><strong>Intentionality:</strong> Embed jobs and skills strategies in national climate and industrial plans, backed by data-driven workforce intelligence and local transition pacts.</li><li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Build modern, modular training systems and industry-led consortia to align skills with emerging green sectors.</li><li><strong>Investment:</strong> Treat spending on human capital as investment, not consumption, mobilizing domestic revenues, business incentives, and international finance for long-term workforce development.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/PUBLICATION2227-1\"><strong>Access the Leaders Summary and new research here.</strong></a></p><p>“The transition to a new economy is not a burden, but a historic opportunity to create jobs, empower youth and drive inclusive growth,” said <strong>Hon. Dr. Eng. Festus K. Ng’eno</strong>, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry, Kenya. “With over 40% of Kenyans employed in agriculture and a rapidly growing youth population, investing in our people’s skills for sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and transport is essential to building a more resilient, competitive and equitable economy for generations to come.”</p><p>“The data is clear — the skills needed for jobs are changing faster than ever,” said <strong>Allen Blue</strong>, Co-Founder of LinkedIn. “Our research shows demand for green talent continues to grow at twice the pace of skills in the workforce. Closing this gap will only happen with urgent, coordinated action to put green training at the core of every climate and business plan. Doing so not only accelerates progress, it connects people to economic opportunity.”</p><p>To deliver impact, the Initiative will work across different tracks to bring together knowledge and learning, help to establish country and industry action partnerships and build a movement. Early engagement is underway with countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, and partnerships are forming with leading development institutions and private-sector coalitions. As a foundation for further cooperation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH commissioned and published three country case studies (<a href=\"https://mia.giz.de/qlinkdb/cat/ID=253787000\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"https://mia.giz.de/qlinkdb/cat/ID=253785000\">Kenya</a><a href=\"https://mia.giz.de/esearcha/browse.tt.html\"> </a>and <a href=\"https://mia.giz.de/qlinkdb/cat/ID=253786000\">Pakistan</a>), while the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German government funded a case study on the <a href=\"https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/en/iki-media/publication/the-impacts-of-skills-shortages-on-global-power-sector-emissions-new68ee1f2ee1d93251521930/\">impact of skills shortages on global power emissions</a>.</p><p>Leaders supporting the new Initiative underscored how the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy will succeed only if it is powered by skilled, secure and supported workers. They called for a new compact between climate and development actors, positioning human capital as a central pillar of economic and climate transition strategies:</p><p>“A people-centered transition is both a moral imperative and an economic necessity,” said <strong>Jochen Flasbarth</strong>, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. “Social protection, opportunities for retraining and job transition policies are key to ensuring that climate ambition remains both politically and socially sustainable.”</p><p>“Business and industry have a crucial role to play in this transformation,” said <strong>Ricardo Mussa</strong>, Chair of Sustainable Business COP30 (SB COP). “Investing in green skills and workforce transformation is not just good for the planet — it’s good for business. By building the talent base for the low-carbon economy, companies can unlock new markets, strengthen supply chains, and deliver sustainable growth.”</p><p>“We need a coordinated, whole-of-economy approach with investments in skills and workforce development at the center,” said <strong>Dr. Liesbet Steer</strong>, Executive Director at Systemiq and lead author of the report. “Our report shows that a people-centered transition can deliver a powerful triple dividend — stronger economies, greater social cohesion, and faster environmental progress.” </p><p>“The transition to a low-carbon economy will only succeed if people are positioned to benefit from it and equipped to drive it forward,” said <strong>Ani Dasgupta</strong>, President & CEO of WRI. “By investing in people’s skills and potential, we turn the challenge of decarbonization into an engine for growth and shared prosperity.”</p><p>“Skills shortages put global climate goals at risk. There can be no climate transition without a skills transition,” said <strong>Ingrid-Gabriela Hoven</strong>, Managing Director at GIZ. “Accelerating green jobs and skills will yield a triple dividend: stronger and more resilient economies, more social cohesion, and faster progress to a low-carbon economy.”</p><p>“Philanthropy and private investors are key to unlocking the potential of the new economy,” said <strong>Michelle Armstrong</strong>, Managing Director at Ares Management and President of the Ares Charitable Foundation. “Catalytic investments in people’s skills, resilience and potential can help empower communities, expand access to good jobs, and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”</p><p>\"As countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the right tools and partnerships are essential to build capacity for climate innovation — unlocking the social and economic transformation these commitments aim to deliver,\" said <strong>Pablo Vieira</strong>, Global Director of the NDC Partnership. \"The Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy will play a key role in expanding this support, helping countries fast-track NDC implementation and investment for a green and just transition.”</p><p>To learn more about the new research, visit <a href=\"https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/PUBLICATION2227-1\">https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/PUBLICATION2227-1</a> </p><p>The new research was directed by Systemiq and World Resources Institute.

These plans are expected to reflect the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake/about-the-global-stocktake/outcome-of-the-first-global-stocktake\">2023 Global Stocktake</a> — the first full review of global climate progress — which called for deeper emissions cuts and faster action on fossil fuels, renewables, transport and forests, and adaptation and resilience. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-explained\">Learn more.</a></p></div><p>Under the Paris Agreement, 2025 NDCs were technically due in February. As of Nov. 9, <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndc-tracker\">108 countries</a> (including the EU and its 27 member states), covering 71% of the world's emissions, had submitted them.</p><p>Among the G20 — the world's largest GHG emitters — twelve had put forth new NDCs: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Türkiye, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.

According to this year's <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2025\">UN Emissions Gap Report</a>, new NDCs have slightly improved that outlook: If countries fully implement their current commitments, warming could be limited to 2.3-2.5 degrees C (4.1-4.5 degrees F) by 2100. This is still well above the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/1-5-degrees-c-target-explained\">Paris Agreement's goal</a> of limiting warming to 1.5-2 degrees C.</p><p>These projections also assume that countries have the policies and finance needed to turn their pledges into action.

This rapid decline in the coming decade would put the country on track to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-advice-on-the-uks-2035-nationally-determined-contribution-ndc/\">based on</a> realistic rates of technology deployment and ambitious but achievable shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-eu-environment-ministers-back-2040-emission-goal-plan-reach-it-remains-unclear\"><strong>European Union</strong></a> aims to cut emissions 66.25%-72.5% below 1990 levels by 2035. Achieving the higher end of the range (72.5%) is critical to staying on a path to 1.5 degrees C, according to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/modeling-ambitious-ndcs-major-emitters\">WRI analysis</a>. This would also support a smoother and more realistic transition toward the EU Council's goals of reducing emissions 90% by 2040 and reaching net zero by 2050. By contrast, lowering emissions only 66.25% by 2035 would require the EU to make steep and challenging cuts in the final five years before 2040.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-china-announces-new-climate-target\"><strong>China</strong></a> committed to reduce emissions 7%-10% below its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/china-co2-emissions-flat-or-falling-for-past-18-months-analysis-finds#:~:text=China%27s%20dual%20carbon%20goals%20are,of%20their%20peak%20by%202035.\">peak level</a> by 2035. This is the first time China has set an absolute, economy-wide emissions target covering all greenhouse gases and clearly signals a post-peak decline in emissions. The country also announced several sector-specific commitments to support this transition. Current trends suggest China could overdeliver on its 2035 goal, given its rapid deployment of clean technology. The country already saw a year-over-year emissions <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-record-solar-growth-keeps-chinas-co2-falling-in-first-half-of-2025/\">decline of about 1%</a> in the first half of 2025, and recent analysis suggests its CO2 emissions have been <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-co2-emissions-have-now-been-flat-or-falling-for-18-months/\">flat or falling for 18 months</a>. In addition, renewables, batteries and EVs now contribute <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-clean-energy-contributed-a-record-10-of-chinas-gdp-in-2024/#:~:text=Clean,9tn\">roughly one-quarter</a> of China's economic growth.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-indonesia-submits-its-national-climate-commitment-new-emissions-targets-ahead-cop30\"><strong>Indonesia's</strong></a> NDC states that emissions will peak by 2030 and then decline to 1.26-1.49 GtCO2e by 2035, depending on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indonesia-clean-energy-economic-growth-projections\">economic growth</a> and international support. While this marks progress, both scenarios show relatively slow emissions reductions over the coming decade. As a result, Indonesia would need to make steeper, faster cuts after 2035 to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2060 or earlier.</p><p>Other countries, such as<strong> Japan</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong>, have opted for a \"linear\" approach toward net zero. This means if they drew a straight line to their net-zero target (for example, 0 GtCO2e in 2050), their 2030 and 2035 targets would fall along it, reflecting a constant decline in emissions each year. Japan aims to cut emissions 60% from 2013 levels by 2035, while the United States has pledged a 61%-66% reduction from 2005 levels by 2035. This linear approach — compared to earlier, steeper emissions cuts — can still achieve net zero by mid-century, but risks compromising global temperature targets by using more of the world's carbon budget sooner.</p><p>Despite the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and reversing many federal climate policies, its NDC may still guide climate action at the state, city and local levels. Many of these entities <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/press-releases/alliance-2035-target-dec-2024/?ref=csofutures.com\">have already rallied</a> around the new NDC and are committed to making progress toward its targets.</p><p><strong>Canada </strong>made only a marginal increase to its target, shifting from a 40%-45% emissions reduction by 2030 to 45%-50% by 2035 from 2005 levels. This falls short of the <a href=\"https://www.nzab2050.ca/news-insights/net-zero-advisory-body-responds-to-todays-announcement-of-canadas-greenhouse-gas-emissions-target-for-2035\">recommendation</a> from Canada's own Net-Zero Advisory Body, which called for a 50%-55% reduction by 2035 — and warned that anything below 50% risks derailing progress toward the country's legislated net-zero goal by 2050. Canada is also working to cut methane emissions by over 35% by 2030, including a 75% reduction from its oil and gas sector relative to 2012.</p><p><strong>Emissions-reduction targets put forward by major emitters so far:</strong></p><table class=\"table tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Previous 2030 Emissions-Reduction Target</th><th>New 2035 Emissions-Reduction Targets</th><th>Net-Zero Target Year</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Australia</td><td>43% from 2005 levels</td><td>62%-70% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>53.1% from 2005 levels</td><td>59%-67% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>40%-45% from 2005 levels</td><td>45%-50% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>Over 65% carbon intensity reduction below 2005</td><td>7%-10% from peak</td><td>2060</td></tr><tr><td>European Union</td><td>55% from 1990 levels</td><td>66.25%-72.5% from 1990 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>31.89% (unconditional) and 43.2% (conditional) below business as usual by 2030</td><td>Reach 1258-1489 MtCO2e</td><td>2060</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>46% from 2013 levels</td><td>60% from 2013 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico*</td><td>35% (unconditional) and 40% (conditional) below BAU</td><td>364-404 MtCO2e (unconditional) 332-363 MtCO2e (conditional)</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Russian Federation</td><td>70% of 1990 levels</td><td>65%-67% of 1990 levels</td><td>2060</td></tr><tr><td>South Africa</td><td>350-420 MtCO2e</td><td>320-380 MtCO2e</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>South Korea*</td><td>40% below 2018 by 2030</td><td>53%-61% from 2018 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>41% below BAU</td><td>Reach 643 MtCO2e</td><td>2053</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>68% from 1990 levels</td><td>81% from 1990 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>50%-52% from 2005 levels</td><td>61%-66% from 2005 levels</td><td>2050</td></tr></tbody></table><p><sup>*Mexico and South Korea announced 2035 top-line emissions-reduction targets but had not yet officially submitted NDCs as of Nov. 9.</sup></p><h3>How Are High-Emitting Countries Addressing Key Areas like Energy, Forestry and Transport?</h3><p>Establishing specific targets and measures for high-emitting economic sectors is essential for driving progress on the ground. It signals to stakeholders across government, industry and finance where action and investment are most needed to meet climate goals. Such measures are especially important among G20 countries, which can shape global supply chains, set standards, and direct vast public and private capital toward low-carbon solutions.</p><p>As more major emitters come forth with new NDCs, a clearer picture is emerging of how they are embedding sector-specific action into their climate commitments.</p><h4>Energy</h4><p>Only a few G20 countries have set clear renewable electricity targets in their NDCs. The U.K., for example, pledged to achieve at least 95% clean electricity by 2030. Australia committed to 82% renewables by the same year. The EU aims to meet at least 42.5% of its total energy consumption with renewable sources by 2030, with an aspirational goal of 45%. China pledged that, by 2035, it will raise the share of non-fossil fuels in domestic energy consumption to over 30% and increase wind and solar capacity sixfold from 2020 levels. South Africa has set a goal of installing 44 GW of new renewable energy capacity by 2035. Others, including Canada, Brazil, Turkey and Russia, signaled plans to expand clean energy but without quantified targets.</p><p>Meanwhile, progress on transitioning away from fossil fuels remains uneven. The U.K. has already phased out coal power and pledged to hold consultations on ending new oil and gas exploration licenses. Canada and Australia are working to end coal power by 2030 and 2040, respectively. The EU aims for its energy sector to be largely decarbonized in the 2030s, with no place for new coal. Russia positioned natural gas as a transitional fuel, while Brazil encourages the replacement of fossil fuels by promoting \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-announces-pledge-quadruple-sustainable-fuels\">sustainable fuels</a>\" and electrification.</p><p>But this is not enough: Much of the focus remains on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/countries-phasing-out-coal-power-fastest\">phasing out coal</a>, particularly among developed economies, while oil and gas receive less attention. Without clear, time-bound decline pathways for all fossil fuels, clean-energy growth alone may not cut absolute emissions fast enough to align with the Paris Agreement's goals.</p><h4>Transport</h4><p>Only three G20 members include clear targets for zero-emissions vehicles in their NDCs. The U.K. has adopted a mandate requiring 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans to be zero-emissions by 2030, reaching 100% by 2035. Canada's Electric Vehicle Availability Standard requires 100% zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2035. The EU set a target for all new cars, vans and urban buses to be zero-emissions by 2035.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia's 2024 New Vehicle Efficiency Standard introduces declining emissions limits for new vehicles from 2025, aiming to cut emissions intensity by around 60% for passenger vehicles and by half for light commercial vehicles by 2030. And China's NDC envisions that EVs will dominate new vehicle sales by 2035.</p><h4>Forests</h4><p>Most G20 members include land use and forestry measures in their NDCs, though the scope and specificity of those commitments vary widely.</p><p>Some set quantitative restoration and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/forest-carbon-sink-shrinking-fires-deforestation\">carbon sink</a> targets. For example, Brazil pledged to suppress illegal deforestation and scale restoration initiatives, with goals to recover millions of hectares of forest in the coming decades. Canada and the United States have committed to protecting and conserving 30% of their land and waters by 2030. Australia's Strategy for Nature 2024-2030 seeks to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by the same year. China has pledged to expand its forests significantly by 2035, and Indonesia aims to restore two million hectares of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/peatlands-mapping-climate-action-southeast-asia\">peatlands</a> and rehabilitate 8.3 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.</p><p>Countries like Turkey and Russia have made broader conservation pledges without quantified targets. Just two G20 countries, Japan and South Africa, do not include any specific targets or measures related to forestry in their NDCs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1189\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"951\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"728\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"574\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"343\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Cyclists on a closed-off city street to allow for biking and walking.\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/brazil-sao-paulo-cyclists.jpg?VersionId=foGuCuISvtbdA3gTGD_qkoedW3FFd7M5&itok=F-sOdcK-\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, Brazil, is car-free on Sundays to allow for more pedestrians and cyclists.

While the submissions so far offer valuable insights, they don't yet reflect the full picture; deeper analysis will be needed once all NDCs have been submitted.</p><h4>1) Nearly all new NDCs include 2035 mitigation measures, with many setting economy-wide emissions-reduction targets.</h4><p>Almost all of the 108 NDCs submitted thus far — with the exceptions of Niue, Venezuela and Zambia — include new mitigation measures through 2035.</p><p>Most (102) express their 2035 targets as emissions-reduction goals. The exceptions are Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua, which instead included sectoral mitigation measures. Cuba, for example, committed to increase renewable electricity generation and improve energy efficiency by 2035.</p><p>Seventy-one of the countries with emissions-reduction goals set economy-wide targets covering all sectors and greenhouse gases (as encouraged by the 2023 Global Stocktake). Notably, China's new target covers all sectors and GHGs for the first time. This is an important step: China's previous NDCs covered only CO2, but the country's non-CO2 emissions alone place it among the world's top 10 emitters.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries are required to submit economy-wide targets, while developing countries are encouraged to work toward them over time.</p><h4>2) Most countries did not strengthen their 2030 targets.</h4><p>Despite clear scientific evidence and UN decisions urging stronger 2030 targets, only 15 (14%) of 108 countries have strengthened their 2030 emissions pledges. This includes Ethiopia, Saint Lucia, Nepal, Moldova, Jamaica and Montenegro, among others. For example, Montenegro revised its 2030 emissions-reduction target from 35% to 55% and set a 60% target by 2035, compared to 1990 levels.</p><p>Notably, none of the wealthier, high-emitting and more developed countries have strengthened their 2030 targets — despite having the greatest capacity and responsibility to take the lead on slashing emissions.</p><h4>3) Most countries have strengthened their adaptation measures.</h4><p>In the face of worsening climate impacts, 61 of 108 countries set stronger adaptation commitments in their new NDCs, continuing a trend seen in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/state-nationally-determined-contributions-2022\">previous rounds</a>. Many of these countries are prioritizing adaptation across sectors such as food and water systems, public health and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-exactly-are-nature-based-solutions\">nature-based solutions</a>.</p><p>For example, Ecuador, which is particularly vulnerable to heavy rainfall and floods, prioritized action to build resilience of its water resources, human health and settlements, and natural heritage. Canada, which has witnessed devastating wildfires in recent years, cited its National Adaptation Strategy, which provides a framework for disaster resilience, biodiversity, public health and infrastructure.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Firefighters putting out flames along a highway.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-05/canaad-fire-fighters_0.jpg?VersionId=oDsXmUNOUA7kTI8Zc.sWJ1cA5GyZ_rB1&itok=KlqXVuzm\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Canadian firefighters in 2021.

This continues a trend seen in previous rounds, with the vast majority of reported finance needs consistently coming from developing countries.</p><p>Ten, including Ecuador, Barbados, Thailand and Tonga, reported finance needs for the first time in 2025, while 11 increased their estimates compared to previous NDCs. The largest increases came from Angola, whose needs jumped from $44 billion to $412 billion (with about 89% conditional on international support), and Pakistan, whose funding needs rose from $241 billion to $565 billion.</p><p>These numbers highlight the urgent need for scaled and predictable finance to support developing countries' climate goals. At the same time, total finance needs are likely underestimated, given that only about half of the 61 countries included cost data. This underscores the importance of enhanced transparency and support in climate finance planning.</p><h4>5) More countries are incorporating 'just transition' in their NDCs.</h4><p>Compared to previous rounds, more countries now explicitly mention a \"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-is-just-transition-tracking-progress\">just transition</a>\" in their NDCs. Ninety-two (80%) of the NDCs submitted thus far include this concept, which aims to ensure equitable and inclusive action toward low-carbon, climate-resilient societies. Crucially, countries are increasingly going beyond one-line references and expanding upon specific just transition efforts that are already underway or planned. Many, such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/what-just-transition-and-why-it-crucial-colombia\">Colombia</a>, Sri Lanka, Eswatini and the U.K., dedicate entire sections of their new NDCs to this concept.</p><p>Countries are also defining \"just transition\" more clearly and specifying where it is most relevant to their national climate action. Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan and Mauritius note the development of policies, frameworks and commissions to move their domestic just transition actions forward. Brazil and Indonesia explicitly reference decent work and quality jobs. Countries like Moldova, Azerbaijan and the UAE reference the importance of skills and training to support workers and youth. While the energy sector remains the main focus for just transition discussions, some countries also incorporate areas such as water, agriculture, waste and climate adaptation.</p><h4>6) Countries are recognizing the importance of local action.</h4><p>Some countries' NDCs also recognize the critical role that subnational actors, such as cities, states and regions, play in shaping and delivering climate action. According to <a href=\"https://unhabitat.org/urban-content-in-ndc-30-a-global-snapshot-for-cop30\">UN-Habitat</a>, the number of assessed NDCs with strong, action-oriented urban content has nearly doubled since the last cycle, reflecting a clear shift toward recognizing the role of cities in mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>More than 50 of the newly submitted NDCs come from countries that have endorsed the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP)</a> — an initiative that aims to strengthen collaboration between national and subnational governments on climate planning and implementation. As part of this commitment, 77 countries and the EU pledged to consult with and integrate subnational priorities and needs into their NDCs.</p><p>Brazil, for example, highlights an instrument called \"climate federalism\" designed to support the integration of climate action into planning and decision-making across all levels of government. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-colombia-updates-its-climate-commitments-2035\">Colombia</a> acknowledged the role of <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-subnational-governments-are-shaping-colombias-next-generation-climate-commitments/\">subnational governments</a> in planning and implementing measures to both mitigate and adapt to climate change in its NDC.</p><h3>What's Next for NDCs?</h3><p>While some countries have yet to submit their commitments, the storyline is already clear: <strong>New NDCs will not put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C.</strong></p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"> </p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"COP30 resource hub graphic.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/cop30-hub-preview_0.png?VersionId=gSWYoSpsmJpMuxUtgzYUWTpUeOAVwJ0E&itok=nRsU6JTv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n</a><p class=\"secondary\">WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">Watch our Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>The big question now is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/cop30-progress-country-climate-plans\">how countries respond at COP30</a> to narrow that gap.

It reinforces the fact that governments and a broad array of real-economy actors need to work together to orchestrate change. Critically, the Agenda brings much-needed transparency to these pledges by requiring initiatives to publicly report on progress, spurring <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/effective-cooperative-climate-initiatives\">climate coalitions to deliver measurable results</a>.</p><p>“The Agenda elevates action across key systems — from cities to forests to energy. It highlights the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">CHAMP initiative</a>, which unites national and local governments to deliver on climate goals. We look forward to partnering with Brazil and Germany as the first CHAMP co-chairs. It also brings together major efforts to restore forests and land through AFR100, advances ocean action via the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/release-brazil-and-france-launch-new-global-challenge-put-ocean-center-climate-action\">Blue NDC Challenge</a>, and showcases leadership on transforming food systems through the <a href=\"https://allianceofchampions.org/\">Alliance of Champions for Food Systems Transformation</a>. On energy, it spotlights coalitions driving a just transition away from coal, decarbonizing heavy industries such as cement and concrete and more.</p><p>“Finally, rigorous and transparent carbon accounting remains fundamental to progress. The Action Agenda reaffirms that the partnership between the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the foundation of the global carbon-accounting system — and the trusted standard for organizations pursuing credible climate action.”</p>",

Deforestation and agriculture alone account for nearly <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/\">25% of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</a>.</p><p>One might think this effect is uni-directional: Cutting down trees, plowing up grasslands and draining wetlands release GHGs that fuel climate change.

      "description": "<p>We face a paradox: Nature underpins the global economy — providing clean air, water regulation, flood protection, and pollination — yet remains largely invisible in most economic and financial decisions. This is not because its value is insignificant, but because nature is not seen as a critical asset that’s necessary for the economy.</p><p>The failure to fully recognize and embed nature’s value in economic and financial decisions has contributed to rapid ecosystem degradation and climate instability that now threatens economic resilience, food security, human health and quality of life.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/staff-climate-notes/Issues/2024/10/01/Embedded-in-Nature-Nature-Related-Economic-and-Financial-Risks-and-Policy-Considerations-555072\">According to the International Monetary Fund</a>, nature loss is financially material in both directions: economic activity degrades ecosystems and ecosystem decline undermines economic growth, drives inflationary pressures and threatens financial stability. For example, banks face significant vulnerability to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss because many borrowers and assets depend on — and operate in — nature-dependent sectors such as agriculture, forestry and water-intensive manufacturing.</p><p>As ecosystems degrade, costs rise, yields fall and supply chains are disrupted, reducing borrowers’ abilities to repay loans, which thereby increases systemic risk. In agriculture, the economic value of crop production is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36515549/\">12% to 31% lower</a> due to declining pollination as insects, birds and other pollinators succumb to climate change and other human-driven pressures such as land-use change, intensive farming techniques and harmful pesticides.</p><p>By embedding nature into balance sheets, countries and companies can recognize nature’s value explicitly in financial terms and better manage both physical and transition risks — strengthening economic stability while fostering more inclusive, nature-based growth. Furthermore, properly valuing nature can reduce risks that threaten overall economic and financial stability, while supporting long-term prosperity, <a href=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_IHLEG_Making-Natural-Capital-Count_fullreport-1.pdf\">particularly for emerging markets and developing countries</a> that are rich in natural capital but often lack resources and incentives to protect or leverage them sustainably.  </p><p>Experts, financial institutions and companies are increasingly exposed to nature-related risks across their operations and supply chains and are starting to recognize the need for putting nature on their balance sheets as the next frontier of risk management and long-term value creation, allowing businesses and governments to recognize, measure and manage their dependencies and impact on natural systems.</p><p>This article addresses why that matters, particularly from a private sector perspective, and introduces the Nature on the Balance Sheet Initiative, a coalition formed by the <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/\">Capitals Coalition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelandbankinggroup.com/\">The Landbanking Group</a>, <a href=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/\">Systemiq</a> and the <a href=\"https://cgc.ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/\">Center for Global Commons</a>, which seeks to make this transition possible. WRI is collaborating with <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/project/nature-on-the-balance-sheet/\">the Nature on the Balance Sheet Initiative</a> as part of its broader efforts to identify and advance innovative nature-finance mechanisms and investment vehicles aimed at scaling finance for nature.</p><div class=\"callout aligncenter\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Key Terms for Natural Capital Accounting</strong></p><p><strong>Natural Capital</strong>: The stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources that combine to yield a flow of benefits (i.e., ecosystem services) to people. The term highlights that nature is a form of capital asset, comparable to produced capital (roads, buildings) and human capital (knowledge, skills).</p><p><strong>Ecosystems</strong>: Both living components (plants, animals, microorganisms) and the physical environment that interact to provide services to people. In accounting terms, ecosystems are treated as assets described through ecosystem extent and condition accounts.</p><p><strong>Ecosystem Services</strong>: The flows of <em>benefits</em> that people obtain from ecosystems. These are typically classified into: provisioning services (e.g., food, timber, water), regulating and maintenance services (e.g., flood control, climate regulation, soil fertility, pollination) and cultural services (e.g., recreation, aesthetic, spiritual value).</p><p><strong>Nature</strong>-<strong>positive</strong>: A term used to describe an ambition that goes beyond “no net loss” or “net positive impact” toward a future where nature is visibly and measurably improved in absolute terms. While there is not yet a clear or consistent definition, “nature-positive” is best understood not as a target for individual organizations but as a shared goal to halt and reverse nature loss.</p></div><h3>Understanding Nature on a Balance Sheet: Foundations and Emerging Practice  </h3><p>Putting nature on the balance sheet is a figurative and literal way to recognize natural capital as an economic driver in business, finance and government decision-making. It helps to illustrate the ways nature’s condition impacts financial performance and economic strategy, ultimately enhancing natural capital stocks over time.  </p><p>It systematically measures and values how companies, investors and economies depend on and impact natural systems (forests, water, soils, biodiversity, climate regulation) and incorporate those values into financial statements, risk assessments and investment decisions. Making nature-related outcomes visible enables capital allocators to better understand how these dependencies affect business performance and resilience. This, in turn, helps direct finance toward activities that generate measurable nature-positive outcomes while managing exposure to physical and transition risks, reducing the likelihood of stranded assets (economic assets that may lose their value in response to environmental concerns) and fostering more resilient value chains and economies.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Nature on a Balance Sheet Resources</strong></p><p>For practical guidance on this topic, explore the following resources:</p><ul><li>• <a href=\"https://capitalscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Towards-a-Roadmap-for-Putting-Nature-on-the-Balance-Sheet.pdf\">The Roadmap for Putting Nature on the Balance Sheet</a><br /> </li><li>• <a href=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_IHLEG_Making-Natural-Capital-Count_fullreport-1.pdf\">Making Natural Capital Account: An Investment Agenda</a></li></ul><p> </p></div><p>Historically, natural capital accounting has focused on national and subnational public systems, based on the intellectual and methodological foundations developed over several decades. The United Nations’ System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) was first introduced in 1993 to link environmental data with national economic accounts. Meanwhile, the concept of “natural capital” gained traction in the 1990s as ecological economists such as <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2385849\">Robert Costanza and Herman E. Daly</a> argued that nature should be treated as a productive asset providing essential goods and services to human well-being and economic growth.</p><p>The SEEA Central Framework, adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 2012, became the first global statistical standard for environmental-economic accounting. It focuses on the flows of nature’s goods to the economy (e.g., inputs, products and residuals), nature’s individual assets (e.g., water, energy), as well as economic activity related to the environment (e.g., nature-related expenditures).</p><p>The SEEA Ecosystem Accounting, adopted in 2021, expanded SEEA’s measurements to include regulating and cultural functions of ecosystems, by proposing measurement of ecosystems, their condition and provision of services.</p><p>Together, they offer a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041622000092\">globally consistent approach to measuring</a> the environment-economy relationship. The SEEA has already been used to support public policy making in high-priority areas such as climate change and environmental sustainability. However, as the framework is still novel, the producers and potential users of accounts must improve the understanding of SEEA's relevance to ensure a more systematic use for <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/public-policy-uses-of-the-seea-stocks-and-flows-accounts_116778b3-en.html\">informing policies</a>.</p><p>There is now <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2024/html/ecb.ebart202406_02~ae87ac450e.en.html\">explicit</a> <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/sustainable1/en/insights/special-editorial/how-the-world-s-largest-companies-depend-on-nature-and-biodiversity\">recognition</a> that most companies, either directly or indirectly, depend on nature — for water access, soil productivity, pollination and stable climates — while also contributing to nature loss through land-use change, supply-chain impacts and emissions. High-profile financial institutions such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are beginning to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/financial-sector-nature-risks-nature-based-solutions\">integrate nature into investment decisions</a>, reflecting a growing understanding that financial performance is inseparable from the state of natural systems. This increasing urgency to manage nature-related risks and dependencies is shifting attention from public-sector accounting to corporate balance sheets and capital markets. Although <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320724004786\">still nascent</a>, there is increasing recognition of the private sector’s critical role in assessing, accounting for and integrating natural capital into business and finance, and of investors’ influence in driving this transition.</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Corporate Benefits of Putting Nature on the Balance Sheet</strong></p><p>For the private sector practitioners, putting nature on the balance sheet offers the following benefits:</p><ol><li><strong>Stronger Risk Management</strong>: For instance, recording restored wetlands or forests as productive assets or disclosing liabilities for degraded land, water or biodiversity loss. Many sectors, including agriculture, energy and water-dependent industries such as artificial intelligence, rely on nature’s regulating services. Failing to account for these dependencies can leave companies exposed to both physical (e.g., resource scarcity, supply-chain disruption due to nature loss and natural disasters) and transition risks (as policies, markets and consumer preferences shift).</li><li><strong>Better Decision-Making</strong>: Embedding natural-capital metrics into accounts can improve long-term planning and inform trade-offs about land use, production and investment, enabling companies to align financial returns with ecological resilience and avoid stranded assets.</li><li><strong>Increased Revenue and Innovation</strong>: Properly valuing ecosystem services can create new income streams, such as through clear metrics and long-term value for buyers of ecosystems, biodiversity credits, nature-linked contracts and nature-based financial products (e.g., Natural Asset Companies, parametric insurance for ecosystem services) that can reduce costs, diversify revenues and strengthen resilience.</li><li><strong>Demonstrated Industry Leadership</strong>: Embedding nature on the balance sheet can signal genuine industry leadership by moving beyond commitments to measurable action. Demonstrating how nature-related performance contributes to financial outcomes positions a company as a frontrunner in transparency and accountability. This not only differentiates them in client and investor engagement but also strengthens trust among regulators, communities and supply-chain partners.</li></ol></div><h3>Demonstrating Nature on the Balance Sheet in Practice </h3><p>While the concept of adding nature to balance sheets in the private sector is still emerging, several pioneers across different sectors are already integrating natural capital value into financial and strategic decision-making. For example, Forico, a forestry company in Tasmania, used natural capital accounting and demonstrated that when ecosystem services are valued, the broader contribution is roughly <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/3-ways-to-factor-nature-into-balance-sheets/\">four times higher</a> than what appears on its conventional balance sheet. The company <a href=\"https://tnfd.global/knowledge-bank/forico-harvests-670-million-with-sustainable-forestry/\">tripled in value</a> before being acquired by three pension funds for <a href=\"https://tnfd.global/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Forico_1026_FINAL.pdf\">more than $670 million in 2023</a>.</p><p>The Nature on the Balance Sheet Initiative has been working with three early-stage projects in agriculture, mining and financial services. These pioneering efforts, which are still being implemented, provide proof-of-concept examples that other companies can learn from.</p><h4>Belterra</h4><p>Belterra, founded in 2020, works with smallholder farmers in Brazil’s Amazon and Atlantic forests to shift degraded pastureland to biodiverse agroforestry systems that improve productivity — such as for cacao production — while helping conserve critical biomes. Its model combines technical assistance, blended finance and commercial partnerships to support transitions at scale. In its first two years, Belterra has established <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_UpLink_Annual_Impact_Report_2024.pdf\">1,800 hectares of biodiverse agroforestry areas</a> and protected 18,000 hectares of land, with a target to restore 40,000 hectares of Brazilian forests by 2030.</p><p>Belterra’s practice shows that compared to monoculture, agroforestry plots show 55% less soil erosion, more than 50% less nutrient run-off, better water retention, higher biodiversity and more than 2.6 metric tons more of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestration per hectare per year compared to degraded pasture or monoculture. These ecological gains support higher long-term yields, greater climate resilience and lower environmental risk — key benefits that buyers and regulators are beginning to demand as deforestation-related regulations and ESG expectations tighten.</p><p>Building on these outcomes, Belterra is piloting an approach to quantify, verify and value in monetary terms the ecosystem service benefits associated with its cacao production. These include carbon removal, soil-water retention and improvements in species diversity and habitat quality. Modeling suggests that these services add roughly $3,600 of “nature value” per ton of cacao beyond the commodity price. By embedding this verified nature value into outcome-linked offtake contracts, Belterra seeks to reward regenerative farming, attract outcome-based funders and offer buyers a traceable, climate-aligned supply of cacao that outperforms monoculture both ecologically and financially.</p><h4>Vale Base Metals</h4><p>Vale Base Metals (VBM) is exploring how putting nature on the balance sheet can reinforce its existing commitments under the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the International Council on Mining and Metals by treating natural capital as an intangible asset that safeguards the long-term viability of mining operations. VBN is exploring how investment into nature could represent reduced risks, avoided costs and new revenue opportunities, thereby strengthening enterprise value.</p><p>The company has piloted natural capital assessment at the Carajás mining complex in Brazil, mapping landscape changes between 1986 and 2023 to understand how conservation actions have preserved value. The Landbanking Group and VBM are undertaking modeling to assess the value created by different nature investment opportunities, for example, establishment of an ecological corridor, water-body restoration, agroforestry systems on degraded pasture and riparian-zone protection.</p><h4>Manulife Investment Management</h4><p>Manulife Investment Management is one of the world’s largest natural capital investment managers, with over $11.5 billion in timber assets across 5 million acres of timberland as of 2024. An early adopter of TNFD, Manulife has piloted natural capital accounting to demonstrate how nature contributes to long-term asset performance.</p><p>Manulife’s pilot focuses on linking ecosystem services directly to asset performance and valuation. For example, in the Neches watershed in Texas, Manulife manages riparian forests, wetlands and floodplain habitats where water-regulating services are valued at several million dollars annually. By enhancing these ecosystem assets — improving wetland health and forest resilience — the company aims to reduce wildfire, flood and drought risks; and open new revenue opportunities such as payments for ecosystem services. As markets begin to reward nature stewardship, assets demonstrating measurable natural capital value could attract price premiums and interest from investors seeking climate- and nature-aligned portfolios.</p><h3>Challenges and Opportunities for Scaling</h3><p>Momentum is building as early adopters rapidly advance the technical foundations for putting nature on the balance sheet. This frontier is now focusing on overcoming four key areas that hold back wider adoption:</p><ol><li>Creating clear pathways on how to integrate natural-capital valuation into concrete business and financial decisions.</li><li>Mobilizing and activating key stakeholders — accountants, auditors and boards — to embrace the opportunities, moving past initial risk aversion and providing clarity on disclosure and fiduciary duties.</li><li>Showcasing financial returns to clearly demonstrate how natural capital valuation can translate into direct financial returns in the market thanks to the development of high-visibility proof-of-concept projects.</li><li>Aligning regulations and incentives to create a policy environment for corporate action, including phasing out negative subsidies.</li></ol><p>This progress is amplified by significant advances in nature-data technologies, such as high-resolution remote sensing, automated monitoring and environmental DNA, which have significantly lowered the cost of measuring ecosystem extent, condition and services, opening new frontiers for accountability and scale. Furthermore, understanding of the enabling conditions for mainstream uptake has deepened, with recent analyses highlighting the importance of consistent standards, credible governance and access to blended finance. Integrating nature into corporate accounts not only strengthens business risk management but also enables capital markets to reward nature-positive performance and penalize destructive practices, while revealing new opportunities for inclusive growth.</p><p>More evidence and real-world proof points are needed to build investor confidence and demonstrate how natural capital valuation creates tangible financial and resilience benefits. Strengthening and scaling pilot initiatives will be essential to generate this evidence base and move toward consistent adoption at scale – a challenge and opportunity that will be at the forefront of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, which some are referring to as the “Nature COP.” If these opportunities are seized, putting nature on the balance sheet can evolve from an experimental concept into a mainstream financial lever for resilience, competitiveness and systemic change.</p>",

The NDC includes five interconnected components — mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, enabling conditions and means of implementation, and cross-cutting themes — that together outline a pathway for inclusive, low-carbon growth and resilient development.</p><p><em>See the </em><a href=\"https://es.wri.org/noticias/declaracion-mexico-anuncia-un-nuevo-y-firme-compromiso-climatico\"><em>Spanish version</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Below is a statement from Francisco Barnés Regueiro, Executive Director, World Resources Institute Mexico:</strong></p><p>“Mexico’s new climate plan stands among the most ambitious new climate targets from a major emitter, charting a path toward a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economy. It places people and nature at the heart of decision-making and reflects the government’s intent to align climate action with economic opportunity, jobs, social equity, and sustainable growth.</p><p>\"Mexico is aiming for deep emission cuts by 2035, in line with its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 – backed by an absolute target for greater transparency and accountability.</p><p>“On adaptation, the plan strengthens actions across five strategic areas, from climate-resilient production systems and integrated water management to the protection of strategic infrastructure and cultural heritage. New components on loss and damage, as well as on climate and security, reflect the government’s focus on managing the social and economic risks of the climate crisis.</p><p>“The NDC also embeds principles of gender equality, human rights, and intergenerational equity, ensuring that climate action addresses inequality, poverty, and vulnerability. It aims to deliver a just transition that creates decent jobs and broadens economic opportunity for women, Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, youth, and others historically left behind.</p><p>“Mexico’s ambition is clear, but delivering on these goals will require deep structural transformation and a clear, sustained investment strategy that positions climate action as a driver of inclusive and sustainable growth. Success will depend on clear sectoral pathways, robust financing mechanisms, and strong implementation plans once the full NDC is released. Aligning public budgets, financial instruments, and subnational policies with this new climate plan will be critical to unlocking innovation, boosting competitiveness, and creating good-quality jobs in low-carbon sectors.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>Today, WRI joined, as a partner, the Beat the Heat (Mutirão contra o Calor Extremo) initiative, a new effort launched at COP30 led by the COP30 Presidency and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)’s Cool Coalition.</p><p><a href=\"https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/beat-the-heat-in-cities/\">Beat the Heat</a> helps accelerate the implementation of local solutions to mitigate extreme heat, which contributes to more than 500,000 deaths a year. It also aims to advance sustainable cooling mechanisms through new technical assistance and financing pathways. The initiative invites countries, cities and regions to join a collective effort to turn UNEP’s <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-cooling-pledge\">Global Cooling Pledge</a> into meaningful local action and operationalize the EPIC Facility, the pledge’s key implementation mechanism.</p><p>WRI will serve as a core analytical and technical assistance partner for Beat the Heat, lending its urban analytics and capacity-building expertise to support local action. </p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"> </p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\"><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"COP30 resource hub graphic.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/cop30-hub-preview_0.png?VersionId=gSWYoSpsmJpMuxUtgzYUWTpUeOAVwJ0E&itok=nRsU6JTv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n</a><p class=\"secondary\">WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">Watch our Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>Through this initiative, partners have committed to supporting cities in implementing solutions using a dual approach: enabling direct access to funding for on-the-ground implementation and providing technical assistance through a suite of technical partners. New commitments at COP30 bring the number of endorsers of Beat the Heat to <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/amid-rising-heat-sustainable-cooling-can-slash-emissions-and-save\">over 185 cities as well as 83 partner organizations</a>.</p><p>“Heat is the people’s agenda,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, WRI’s Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, at the Beat the Heat launch event in Belém. “Cities are key to protecting people against heat. We need better data so we can invest at speed and scale.”</p><h3>Building Knowledge and Capacity for Cooler Cities</h3><p>WRI’s partnership on Beat the Heat builds on its extensive experience working with cities on several initiatives that support urban heat mitigation.</p><p>One of these initiatives is the Cool Cities Lab, a data platform that enables detailed analysis of local heat risk and cooling solutions. Slated to launch in March 2026, the platform will allow cities to explore fine-grain metrics, identify the neighborhoods most vulnerable to rising temperatures, and tailor action plans to effectively reduce heat risks.</p><p>The Cool Cities Lab also enables cities to model the potential heat-reduction impact of a range of local solutions, from street trees to cool roofs and shade structures. By exploring the cooling potential of different interventions, individually or in combination, cities can develop data-informed intervention plans that deliver meaningful cooling benefits. </p><p>Through the Cool Cities Lab, WRI will provide data and analysis to cities participating in Beat the Heat.</p><p>Supporting this effort is <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/data-cool-cities\">Data for Cool Cities</a>, through which WRI works with urban decision-makers to accelerate the adoption of cooling measures. This initiative equips cities with the data and tools needed to plan, fund, deploy and track solutions. Data for Cool Cities supports cities in three essential ways: by providing data to fill critical information gaps; building data analysis applications that create actionable insights; and scaling solutions through a global community of practice. To date, WRI has worked as a key technical support and implementation partner with more than 30 cities in 12 countries aiming to build their resilience to extreme heat.</p><p>Another initiative, the <a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/projetos/acelerador-solucoes-calor-urbano\">Urban Heat Solutions Accelerator</a>, provides capacity building on developing urban cooling projects currently being implemented to support five Brazilian cities. By focusing on building cities’ long-term capacity to develop heat-resilience projects and establishing reliable financing mechanisms to support implementation, the Accelerator offers the potential to produce lessons and best practices that can strengthen the global Beat the Heat initiative. </p><p>WRI and Drexel University’s Climate Change and Urban Health in Latin America Project (SALURBAL) are also conducting research on how heat, in combination with social factors and multiple aspects of the built environment, influences health-related impacts in neighborhoods in Belo Horizonte and Campinas, Brazil. Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/heat-and-health-brazilian-cities\">Heat and Health in Brazilian Cities</a> project, WRI is working with community members and policymakers in both cities to guide research and <span> </span>support the design and implementation of heat adaptation measures that safeguard health and promote equity. </p><h3>Speeding Up Action for Heat-Resilient Cities</h3><p>With climate change intensifying and increasingly threatening lives and livelihoods, now is the time for cities to take meaningful action on heat. WRI Ross Center is proud to join the coalition of partners behind Beat the Heat and contribute to the technical expertise needed to accelerate the implementation of effective heat solutions in more cities. </p><p><em>Interested in joining the effort to Beat the Heat? </em><a href=\"https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=2zWeD09UYE-9zF6kFubccOWo9BkcgmJOo2607C_CGg5UNDdJT1JDUUlEM1pNOVkwRlY5TjBLQlRLQy4u&route=shorturl\"><em>Register here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Want to learn more about Cool Cities Lab? </em><a href=\"https://worldresourcesinstitute.typeform.com/subscribe-ccl?typeform-source=word-edit.officeapps.live.com\"><em>Sign up for updates</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
