(Though residuals will also be the result of political and economic decisions about both emissions reductions and carbon removal deployment.)</p><h3>2) How Do Residual Emissions Relate to Carbon Removal?</h3><p>To achieve net zero, the world will need enough carbon dioxide removal to counterbalance any residual emissions, such that the sum of residual emissions and removals is zero. This carbon removal can come from both nature-based approaches (like planting trees) and novel, technological approaches (like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\">direct air capture</a>).</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1350\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1080\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"827\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"651\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"390\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Charts showing how residual emissions and carbon removal can balance out to achieve net-zero emissions.\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/residual-emissions-carbon-removal-net-zero-wri_0.png?VersionId=7Eao0OKP72jjjnqAjklFuxMrQ6iPCxt5&itok=c5VBzthd\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Technically, net zero could be achieved with any balance of emissions reductions and removals (as seen in the illustration above). However, there is a big difference between a future where emissions remain high and we rely heavily on carbon removals, and one where emissions and removals are both low. Pathways that maximize emission reductions and minimize the future need for CDR are the most likely to minimize climate hazards. This is because <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-co2-removal-is-not-equal-and-opposite-to-reducing-emissions/\">reductions and removals <strong>are not equivalent</strong></a> in their environmental, economic or social impacts.</p><p>Steep, near-term emissions reductions can limit peak warming and help minimize the potential for crossing irreversible climate tipping points. But pathways that allow for higher levels of removal in place of steep emissions reductions risk allowing higher peak temperatures, which could lead to even more dangerous heat waves, fires, storms and floods.</p><h3>3) How Much Residual Emissions Are Expected, and Where Would They Likely Come From?</h3><p>Even the most ambitious climate scenarios (which limit warming to 1.5 degrees C with limited or no overshoot) project that about <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/633458017a1ae214f3772c76/t/665ed1e2b9d34b2bf8e17c63/1717490167773/The-State-of-Carbon-Dioxide-Removal-2Edition.pdf\">5-10 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) per year</a> of emissions will remain around midcentury and will need to be counterbalanced by CDR. That's about equal to 1-2 times the United States' current net GHG emissions.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>How Are Residual Emissions Estimated?</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Many global estimates of residual emissions at net zero come from <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/publications/integrated-assessment-models-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-arrive-at-their-conclusions\">integrated assessment model (IAM)-based scenarios</a>, which show how various climate policy interventions may interact with societal structures and Earth systems processes to influence temperatures. While IAMs provide global top-down estimates, countries must also assess CDR needs in their own climate plans. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-04/2022-Strategic-Vision-The-Role-of-Fossil-Energy-and-Carbon-Management-in-Achieving-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions_Updated-4.28.22.pdf#page=12\">Bottom-up, sectoral assessments</a> may provide more precises estimates, as they assess each sector individually — using estimates of abatement technology development — to project which emissions will be un-abatable by midcentury.</p></div><p>However, these estimates involve a lot of uncertainty. Many factors — including future technological and economic developments, cost reductions, product substitutions, demand shifts and behavior changes — will influence how much we can reduce emissions over the coming decades and therefore how much will be leftover, or residual, by midcentury.</p><p>Given these uncertainties, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly where residual emissions will come from. Scenarios analyzed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) offer some estimates of residual emissions sources at midcentury, which are outlined below.</p><p>In pathways that limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, non-CO2 emissions such as methane (mainly from agriculture) make up the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2#:~:text=Out%20of%201.5%20Gt%20of,and%20regional%20analysis%20is%20limited.\">majority of residual emissions</a>. Other residual emissions come from transport and industry, though the relative amounts vary significantly depending on the scenario.</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\" width=\"624\"><thead><tr><th width=\"107\"><strong>Sector</strong></th><th width=\"517\"><strong>Activities that may generate residual emissions</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th width=\"107\"><p class=\"secondary\"><strong>Agriculture</strong></p></th><td width=\"517\"><p><strong><u>Livestock management</u>:</strong> Agricultural emissions from ruminant animal digestion (such as cows, sheep and goats) are expected to increase along with the global population and demand for animal products.

The emissions from these cars would therefore be residual.</p><h3>4) How Are Countries Planning for Residual Emissions and Carbon Removal?</h3><p>As of June 2025, <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker\">more than 100 countries</a> had set economy-wide net-zero emissions targets. Fifty-eight of them had begun laying out plans to achieve these targets in their <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate/long-term-strategies\">long-term strategies</a> (LTSs), which guide long-term low-emissions development. But just having a net-zero target doesn't mean residual emissions are fully addressed. Not all countries with net-zero targets in their long-term strategies quantify expected residual emissions, and among those that do, they don't all indicate the sources.</p><p>Across the countries that estimate residual emissions in their long-term strategies, agriculture accounts for the <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(24)00199-4\">largest proportion</a> of expected residual emissions: 35% on average. Following agriculture, the energy sector makes up around 20% of residual emissions, mostly from the use of fossil fuels in homes for heating and cooking. Other sources mentioned are industry, as well as small amounts of residual emissions from transport and waste.</p><p>Many countries also articulate plans to use conventional CDR approaches, like <a href=\"https://wriorg.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/carbonshot-tree-restoration.pdf\">tree restoration</a>, in their long-term strategies. And <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/lts-explore?category=ghg_target&indicator=lts_crbn_rmvl\">26 mention</a> plans to use or consider the use of novel, technological carbon removal approaches like <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal\">direct air capture</a>.</p><p>Countries also take different approaches in considering how to estimate and address their residual emissions. <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(24)00199-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332224001994%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">Canada, for example</a>, presents a scenario with lower emissions reductions and high residual emissions from continued fossil fuel production and consumption, which it would counterbalance with a high level of novel CDR. <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(24)00199-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332224001994%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">Sweden</a>, on the other hand, explicitly aims to minimize residual emissions as much as possible to avoid over-reliance on CDR.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"cw\"></div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>5) Why Is Overreliance on Carbon Removal Risky?</h3><p>Scenarios that rely heavily on CDR to enable the continued use of fossil fuels, as in Canada's long-term strategy, underscore a common concern: that CDR will be used to compensate for emissions which could otherwise be abated.</p><p>There are several risks associated with this kind of planning. Carbon removal is not yet scaling quickly enough to meet the anticipated need at midcentury. And relying on CDR to counterbalance emissions that could otherwise be reduced means that less of this limited capacity — which faces real sustainability limits — would be available to balance out emissions for which there aren't immediate low-carbon alternatives.</p><h4>Most CDR technology is still in development.</h4><p>Countries that estimate large amounts of residual emissions, including emissions that could otherwise be abated, are relying on the promise of a massive CDR scale-up. However, novel carbon removal technologies, like DAC and carbon mineralization, are still relatively early in development and have not yet been deployed at a large scale. It remains uncertain whether and how fast these technologies will be able to scale globally — so counting on them to be available at high levels can be risky.</p><p>The potential for large-scale CDR deployment therefore cannot be viewed as an excuse to delay emissions reductions. Countries must plan to slash emissions as deeply as possible, so that residual emissions at net zero are minimized and CDR is only being used where necessary. If carbon removal is not able to scale to the extent needed, countries risk missing not only their CDR goals, but also their broader long-term climate targets.</p><h4>There are limits to sustainably scaling CDR.</h4><p>While estimates vary, a growing body of literature suggests that there are <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj6171\">limits</a> to the amount of carbon removal that can be deployed sustainably, both in terms of resource use and social impacts.</p><p>With constraints on necessary resources like land, water and energy, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01365-z\">these studies</a> find that the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9f/meta\">quantity of CDR</a> that will be available without compromising other sustainability goals is well below what IPCC scenarios show will be <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/\">technically feasible</a> by midcentury. There are also concerns around the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2\">societal impacts</a> of this natural resource usage; for instance, how it could affect food production, land rights, or the livelihoods of rural communities and Indigenous peoples.</p><p>As more CDR is used to address residual emissions (including those that could have been abated) to reach net-zero, less will be available to reduce atmospheric CO2 and achieve <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-why-some-countries-are-aiming-for-net-negative-emissions/\">net-negative</a> emissions — which will be needed to help bring global temperatures back down to lower levels.</p><h3>6) What Does This Mean for Countries' Climate Plans?</h3><p>We know some level of carbon removal will be needed to address residual emissions and help reach net zero. But with CDR techniques still largely nascent and their scalability not guaranteed, it's highly uncertain how much removal we can count on.</p><p>As such, CDR should be planned for as a limited resource on the path to net zero, used to balance out only the most difficult to abate emissions sources. This is particularly true for high-income countries that have more capacity to invest in emissions-reduction interventions.</p><p>Countries should pursue several measures in their net-zero planning to ensure that emissions are reduced deeply and rapidly, and that carbon removal is planned for responsibly:</p><h4>Transparently communicate how residual emissions are being estimated.</h4><p>How countries identify and estimate residual emissions must be transparent. Using <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-04/2022-Strategic-Vision-The-Role-of-Fossil-Energy-and-Carbon-Management-in-Achieving-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions_Updated-4.28.22.pdf\">bottom up sectoral assessments</a> may provide a more precise quantification of residual emissions than top-down estimates. This approach could enable countries to transparently communicate what emissions CDR would counterbalance by sector.</p><p>Transparently communicating estimated residual emissions — and how those estimates were derived — can help ensure carbon removal is being planned for responsibly and is not delaying emissions reductions. It can also help countries share best practices and develop a more consistent approach to addressing residual emissions through carbon removal.</p><h4>Establish and clearly communicate separate targets.</h4><p>Within their overarching climate targets, countries should <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/separate-climate-targets-carbon-dioxide-removal\">set separate targets</a> for emissions reductions and removals. This can provide transparency around the relative levels of each. It is the first step to ensuring that countries avoid over-relying on future carbon removal to reach net zero. Some early adopters, such as Sweden, have already set separate targets.</p><p>Countries can also voluntarily include information about their estimated residual emissions and plans for CDR in their <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/climate/long-term-strategies#:~:text=Although%20voluntary%2C%20long-term%20strategies%20are%20central%20to%20the,hunger%20and%20uplift%20people%20in%20myriad%20other%20ways.\">long-term strategies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/next-ndcs-5-point-plan\">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs), due in 2025 and widely expected before the UN climate summit in November. NDCs can be <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/ndcs/resources/technological-carbon-removal\">used</a> to set intermediate targets not just for CDR, but also around goals for capacity building and support, like public investment in research and development.</p><h3>Looking Ahead</h3><p>Countries need to start planning for how to meet their net-zero goals today. These plans must aim to maximize emissions reductions and thereby minimize the level of residual emissions — and CDR needed — to reach net-zero. They should plan for CDR responsibly and transparently, being clear about the expected sources of residual emissions and ensuring they are only relying on CDR to counterbalance those that are most difficult to abate. </p><p>The less CDR we use to enable continued use of fossil fuels and other avoidable emissions, the more will be available to enable net zero and ultimately net negative emissions — keeping a safer future within reach.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Brussels (11 June 2025)</strong> — Today, World Resources Institute (WRI), We Mean Business Coalition, and Strategic Perspectives convened high-level policymakers, business leaders and experts to push for a robust 2040 emissions target and a credible 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for the EU.  </p><p>With key climate decisions, including the EU Environmental Council meeting (June 17) and the European Commission’s Climate Law amendment (July 2) approaching, experts underlined the mounting costs of inaction. Over the past decade, climate-related damages in the EU exceeded <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20221024-1\">€145 billion</a>, while fossil fuel imports reached <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20250321-1\">€376 billion</a> in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, renewable energy now supplies a record <a href=\"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/research-and-technology/clean-energy-competitiveness_en\">48% of EU electricity</a>, underscoring the potential for a cleaner, more resilient economy.</p><p>At the event, We Mean Business Coalition, in collaboration with Corporate Leaders Group Europe (CLG Europe), also launched a <a href=\"https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/blog/how-the-eus-next-ndc-can-strengthen-energy-security-and-industrial-competitiveness/\">policy note</a> outlining how policymakers and businesses can collaborate on a robust, investible EU NDC that helps enhance energy security, economic strength and industrial competitiveness. </p><p><strong>Following are statements from participating leaders:</strong></p><p><strong>María Mendiluce</strong>, CEO, We Mean Business Coalition: “The EU’s next NDC must send a clear signal that the EU is serious about competing and leading in the global low-carbon economy. Business is ready to invest, but needs policy clarity and predictability. A robust NDC aligned with the EU’s existing commitments — together with clear plans and policies for implementation <span style=\"font-family: Georgia,serif;\">—</span> will boost business confidence, drive innovation, and deliver a more resilient and competitive economy.”</p><p><strong>Karen Pflug</strong>, Chief Sustainability Officer, Ingka Group: “The swift adoption of the EU’s NDC and an ambitious 2040 climate target is essential in providing assurance to progressive companies investing in the green transition at a time of great uncertainty. The EU must remain a global leader in this space, focusing on and communicating about the opportunities for the jobs, innovation and economic growth that climate ambition presents.”</p><p><strong>Stientje van Veldhoven</strong>, Vice-President, WRI: “With key milestones ahead, like the COP30 climate summit in November, the EU has a critical strategic choice to make. Major economies — particularly China — are ramping up investment in clean energy and industry. An ambitious NDC puts the EU on course to compete for the market of the future and secure its energy independence.” </p><p><strong>Cedric de Meeûs</strong>, VP Group Public Affairs and Social Impact, Holcim: “As industry we need regulatory certainty which is an integral part of the business case for large-scale industrial transformation. It’s the foundation for the long-term investments we are making and planning for the future. We can simplify regulation, but we should not dilute, nor delay.</p><p><strong>Anne-Sophie Cerisola</strong>, Distinguished Fellow, Strategic Perspectives: “With the upcoming NDC, the EU must demonstrate it will remain the climate leader it has been for the past decade. Internationally, the EU should work with other countries and companies, for example, in greening supply chains. It's vital to support developing countries with finance and technical assistance, especially amid ODA cuts and high capital costs — and to back Brazil's efforts to build a broad climate coalition, from China to small island states.\"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

However, first-generation biofuels such as ethanol or biodiesel also have large land footprints, which drive climate-harming emissions when land is converted from natural landscapes, such as forests or <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/grassland-benefits\">grasslands</a>, to specifically grow crops for biofuels.</p><p>The U.S. currently grows corn and soybeans, the two most dominant biofuel feedstock crops, on 178 million acres of farmland concentrated mostly in Midwest states — including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.</p><p>When corn and soy are used to create transportation fuels, they require significant land use for minimal fuel supply. Of the 92 million acres of corn grown in the U.S., roughly one-third — about 30 million acres or about the size of the state of Mississippi — is used for ethanol production. <strong>However, despite this massive land footprint, ethanol from corn only supplied 4% of U.S. transportation fuel in 2022.</strong> And while more than 40% of the U.S. soybean oil supply has been used for biofuels each year since 2022, <strong>biodiesel made from soybeans supplied less than 1% of U.S. transportation fuel in 2022. </strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/16621583/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Beyond the emissions of producing and refining these fuels, crop-based biofuels can contribute to rising emissions by displacing more climate-friendly uses of prime farmland, such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/crop-expansion-food-security-trends\">producing food</a>.</p><p>Some biofuels crops are also grown on low-productivity lands prone to flood, erosion or drought. These lands could instead host low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar farms or be restored to grasslands or forests. Wind and solar farms can produce much more energy than biofuels per acre while restoring marginally productive land not needed for food could increase carbon stocks.  When these land-use opportunity costs are accounted for, it becomes clear that growing food and agricultural crops for biofuels are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/why-dedicating-land-bioenergy-wont-curb-climate-change\">not an effective tool to curb climate change</a>.</p><p>Biofuel expansion is also harming communities by polluting air and water, and by straining limited water supplies in drought-prone areas. This problem will likely worsen as climate effects intensify.  Research also shows that the economic benefits that many policymakers cite have been <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/who-receives-crop-insurance-subsidy-benefits/\">unequally distributed</a> to larger farms, which may exacerbate long-standing inequities among Midwestern farmers and communities.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"An aerial view of corn being harvested by a farm machine and poured into tractor bins.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2024-02/midwest-corn-harvest%20.jpg?VersionId=3IGGLthHTBsOyeFdmWmvNaYshr8NRk9h&h=ba126e57&itok=ek6IjOUZ\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The expansion of corn and soy crops specifically grown for biofuel production increases agricultural emissions and displaces land that could be used for food or other purposes. Photo by JamesBrey / iStock. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As decision-makers assess the future of first-generation biofuels incentives in the Midwest, WRI research shows that there are three key factors to pay attention to:</p><h3>1) Increased Biofuels Production Could Contribute to Economic Inequities</h3><p>Midwestern biofuel production has likely widened the gap between large- and small-scale farmers as government incentives and subsidies overwhelmingly flow to larger mechanized farms that grow soy and corn. While biofuel incentives were enacted partially to help rural communities and struggling farmers, the benefits are likely to have <a href=\"https://commons.law.famu.edu/famulawreview/vol8/iss2/11/\">accrued unevenly</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/who-receives-crop-insurance-subsidy-benefits/\">One study finds</a> that nearly 57% of crop insurance subsidies, which often disproportionately support crops like corn and soy, go to the largest 10% of farms, with the top 1% of farms receiving almost double the amount of money per acre than the majority (90%) of smaller farms.</p><p>Data also shows that biofuels may not live up to promises for large-scale job creation. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/policy/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer\">biofuel jobs</a> constitute less than 2% of regional energy jobs, including agricultural jobs related to energy.</p><p>Growing crops for biofuels may also be raising prices for livestock farmers and consumers. While the Renewable Fuel Standard was responsible for $14 billion in profit from 2005 to 2015, <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/the-impact-of-the-u-s-renewable-fuel-standard-on-food-and-feed-prices/\">livestock farmers lost $3 billion in 2019 alone</a> due to higher corn and soy prices needed to feed their animals. Peer-reviewed studies have also found that biofuel production <a href=\"https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wene.155?_gl=1*1k4s4qn*_gcl_au*MzExMjY0NDk3LjE3NDkwNDM2MTM.*_ga*Mzc4ODc5NDk2LjE3NDkwNDM2MTI.*_ga_9C4T5P6PP6*czE3NDkwNDM2MTQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NDkwNDM2MjckajQ3JGwwJGg2ODkzODE1Nzg.\">increases global food prices</a>, potentially increasing global <a href=\"https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/biofuel-blunders-time-to-fix-two-decades-of-eu-policies-driving-food-insecurity-621622/\">food insecurity</a>.</p><p>The flow of economic benefits to large-scale farmers could also exacerbate the trend of farmland consolidation that is squeezing out small- and medium-sized farms. This leads to fewer and larger farms receiving benefits, and it is accelerating the loss of midsize farms which have historically been the economic backbone of many local communities. This contributes to economic and social challenges in the rural Midwest.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23464386/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>In an analysis of data from 1978 to 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/bigger-farms-bigger-problems\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> found “large crop farms are getting larger, small crop farms are getting smaller, and midsize crop farms are disappearing.” Over the almost four decades of the study, the number of large farms grew by 140%, while half of midsized farms were lost in the Midwest. While cropland consolidation has decreased the number of farmers across all racial groups, the trend has been 2.5 times more severe for Black farmers.  </p><p>Increased farmland value, which is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/us/politics/farmland-values-prices.html\">likely partially driven by biofuels production</a>, is also contributing to inequalities among farmers. Because farmland continues to increase in value, corporations and wealthy individuals have invested in large swaths of farmland. Increased farmland value may be positive for existing landowners, but expensive land and rent can make it impossible for new farmers to succeed and those with modest resources to enter the profession.</p><p>While today Midwestern farmers tend to be white (98%), male (67%) and over 55 years old (61%), this wasn’t always the case. Many Indigenous,  Black and other farmers of color  have lost land in the Midwest due to violence and discriminatory policies that made it difficult, if not impossible, to <a href=\"https://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RS20430.pdf\">access finance and farm assistance</a>. Farmers of color also are more likely to operate smaller farms that reap fewer benefits from federal assistance programs. As a result, small-scale farmers and farmers of color benefit less from first-generation biofuels subsidies.            </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/16939061/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Policymakers should assess whether additional support for biofuels may exacerbate, rather than improve, challenges facing their communities. Future agricultural and clean energy policy in the Midwest could then support all farmers and protect global consumers against rising food prices.</p><div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Racial and Gender Dynamics of US Farmers</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">While analyzing trends in data is critical to understanding racial dynamics in farming, federal agricultural data may not always reflect the full story. Many farmers lack documented legal ownership of their land because of laws governing how land is passed down through generations, particularly Black and Native American farmers. One study found that Black farmers lost <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-black-farmers-lost-326-bln-worth-land-20th-century-study-2022-05-02/\">$326 billion</a> worth of land in the 20th century due to discriminatory lending practices and legal difficulties that come with inheriting untitled land (known as <a href=\"https://grist.org/fix/justice/what-is-heirs-property-a-huge-contributor-to-black-land-loss-you-might-not-have-heard-of/\">heir’s property</a>).</p><p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/#:~:text=Roughly%20Half%20of%20Hired%20Crop,declined%20to%20about%2040%20percent.\">as of 2022, 42% of people working on U.S. farms</a> were undocumented immigrants. Corn and soy production is highly mechanized, so it’s unlikely that undocumented workers make up a considerable portion of biofuels workers. However, this constitutes a major data gap.</p><p>Women are another major group that may not be accurately accounted for. Married white women farmers are more likely to have their husband designated as the primary producer or business owner and therefore may not be represented adequately in federal data.</p></div><h3>2) New Biofuels Production Could Put Community Health and Resilience at Risk</h3><p>The lifecycle of biofuels, from crop production to refining, contributes to water and air pollution in Midwestern communities that impact people’s health. For example, increased fertilizer use from expansion of corn cultivation can deplete oxygen in <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6913057/the-gulfs-growing-dead-zone/\">downstream waterways</a> and <a href=\"https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/farm-fertilizer-runoff-is-impacting-drinking-water-in-the-midwest-not-just-the-gulfs-dead-zone/\">raise concentrations of nitrates</a> in the tap water of heavy agriculture areas. While many rural communities can see spikes in nitrate levels past the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/estimated-nitrate-concentrations-groundwater-used-drinking\">EPA limit</a> of 10 parts per million (ppm), many average around 5 ppm, which still <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6068531/\">carry long-term health risks</a> like cancer and birth defects. A total of <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/estimated-nitrate-concentrations-groundwater-used-drinking\">11,510 square miles</a> of the Midwest is estimated to have groundwater nitrate concentrations above the federal limit.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/research/troubled-waters\">Environmental Working Group report</a> also found Midwestern states have a high overlap between poor water quality and heavily agricultural areas, with poor water quality more likely to affect <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/2020-nitrate-pollution-of-drinking-water-for-more-than-20-million-americans-is-getting-worse/\">smaller, rural</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2021/06/midwest-farm-states-nitrate-pollution-tap-water-more-likely-lower-income\">lower income</a> communities.</p><p>Refining biofuels can also contribute to climate-harming emissions and <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c00698\">respiratory issues</a> among nearby residents. Midwestern ethanol refineries collectively released greenhouse gases totaling <a href=\"https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do?site_preference=normal\">17.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results\">equivalent to</a> the emissions caused by driving 44 billion miles, and requiring 17 million acres of forests to offset.</p><p>The refineries also contribute air-polluting volatile organic compounds and ground-level ozone, <a href=\"https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Biofuels-report-EMBARGOED-for-6.12.24.pdf\">releasing an aggregate of almost 4 times</a> the amount of acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde and hexane compared to oil refineries. Biofuel refineries <a href=\"https://environmentalintegrity.org/reports/farm-to-fumes-hazardous-air-pollution-from-biofuel-manufacturing/\">have also been known</a> to violate already-lax pollution limits, which can put nearby residents at a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34232029/\">greater risk</a> of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00698\">respiratory issues</a>.</p><p>Growing feedstock crops and refining biofuels also requires <a href=\"https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2011/03/21/ethanol%E2%80%99s-impacts-on-our-water-resources/#:~:text=Corn%20ethanol%20consumes%2010%20to%20324%20gallons%20of,%28the%20range%20is%20due%20to%20different%20production%20technologies%29.\">high volumes of water</a> that could deplete underground aquifers used by Midwestern farms that don’t get enough rainfall to irrigate crops. The <a href=\"https://modernfarmer.com/2015/07/ogallala-aquifer-depletion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Ogallala Aquifer</a>, which supplies water to many heavily-farmed areas, for example, is expected to be 69% depleted by 2060.</p><p>As climate change intensifies droughts and erratic weather conditions, growing crops for biofuels in water-stressed areas will come with more tradeoffs. These concerns should spur policymakers to adequately weigh public health impacts and long-term risks related to the entire lifecycle of biofuel cultivation, refining and use.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23551870/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>3) Ramping Up Biofuels Production Would Increase Emissions</h3><p>The Midwest is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/midwest/topic/agriculture-midwest\">world</a>, but as a result, it has an outsized agricultural greenhouse gas footprint comprised largely of fertilizers, animal manure management, on-farm energy use and emissions from land use change. For biofuels specifically, emissions arise from each step of the agricultural process as well as transportation, refining and combustion.</p><p><strong>In fact, when accounting for the entire lifecycle emissions of corn ethanol production, this ‘green’ fuel produces more greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline</strong>. One study found that the increase of ethanol produced as a result of the Renewable Fuel Standard has <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101084119\">24% higher emissions intensity</a> than fossil fuel gasoline due to domestic land-use change and fertilizer use. With corn and soy occupying over half of the nation’s farmland, these first-generation feedstocks have large agricultural and emissions footprints.</p><p>Increased biofuels production can come at the expense of natural lands, like forests and grasslands, which release emissions when they are cleared to accommodate biofuels crops. One model estimates that the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2101084119\">Renewable Fuel Standard caused 26% more conversion</a> of U.S. natural land to cropland than would have occurred without the policy. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6446#:~:text=We%20assessed%20changes%20to%20the,million%20acres%20of%20converted%20grassland.\">separate study</a> found that 4.2 million acres of land were converted to cropland within 100 miles of biorefineries between 2008 and 2012, further suggesting the expansion was caused by biofuel demand. Neither of these studies, however, accounts for global land-use change driven by U.S. biofuels expansion, so total land conversion could be much higher.</p><p> Another <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0757-z\">study</a> that counted global land use change emissions found that corn ethanol emissions intensity can be twice as high as gasoline; and soybean biodiesel emissions intensity can be three times as high as traditional fossil fuel diesel.</p><p>While there is potential for advanced biofuels to provide climate benefits, those that use crops requiring dedicated use of land could have emissions impacts because they would divert cropland from food or feed production. Advanced biofuels made from agricultural wastes and residues can reduce emissions relative to fossil fuels. However, many residues are already harvested for other uses or provide important benefits like soil health, and their realistic contribution to energy supply is likely limited.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two men standing in a soybean field.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/midwest-soybean-field.jpg?VersionId=l_HnZmscOThF55y.YdtfOjpHbJAfo3zo&itok=_h85tZDJ\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Two farmers inspect a soybean field.

But there are opportunities to reduce the future environmental footprint and human impact of the industry.</p><p>To avoid negative impacts, it will be necessary for policymakers to place limits on future crops grown specifically for the use of biofuels. This is true both for biofuels used to power cars and for the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emissions-impacts\">expanding “sustainable aviation fuel” industry</a>, which could drive a vast expansion of land devoted to biofuels crops. Measures that limit land devoted to biofuels production can be added to existing policies by capping credits for first-generation biofuel feedstocks or correcting land use change calculations in biofuel policies.</p><p>Instead of further expansion of first-generation biofuels, policymakers should investigate the potential for advanced biofuels that do not require dedicated use of land, such as fuels that use agricultural wastes or residues. WRI is currently conducting additional research on the opportunity to use corn stover (the parts of the corn, such as stalks, leaves and cobs, left in the field after its harvested) as a biofuel feedstock.</p><p>To create new, environmentally beneficial opportunities, policymakers can expand support for small-scale and marginalized farmers, incentivize nitrogen management and climate-friendly agricultural practices, and invest in the build-out of new clean energy industries in the Midwest. Additional research is also needed to identify new  markets and opportunities that can equitably support farmer livelihoods, strengthen rural economies and food systems, and effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. These new pathways should anticipate constraints on water, land and food supplies, and they should consider fairer and more effective ways to generate clean, renewable energy.</p><p><em><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> This article was originally published on Feb. 27, 2024, and updated on June 10, 2025 with new findings, research and information. </em></p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Eight inaugural countries already committed to challenge</em></p><p><strong>Nice, France (June 9, 2025) </strong>- Today at the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC), Brazil and France launched a landmark international initiative to dramatically scale up ocean-focused climate action. The Blue NDC Challenge calls on all countries to place the ocean at the heart of their climate plans (nationally determined contributions, or NDCs) ahead of COP30 which Brazil will host in November.</p><p>Alongside Brazil and France, an inaugural group of eight countries including Australia, Fiji, Kenya, Mexico, Palau, and the Republic of Seychelles, has already joined the initiative, committing to include the ocean in their updated climate plans under the Paris Agreement. These plans represent the centerpiece of each country’s efforts to reduce emissions and limit warming to 1.5°C and build resilience, and represent the highest level of political will under the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p>Launched today, and building on the momentum this year brings as countries prepare to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, the Blue NDC Challenge underscores the urgent need to recognise the ocean’s central role in addressing the climate crisis as a key ally. The initiative is supported by Ocean Conservancy, the Ocean & Climate Platform, and the World Resources Institute through the Ocean Resilience and Climate Alliance (ORCA) and has been endorsed by WWF-Brazil.</p><p>In addition to its forests, Brazil is also an oceanic nation, with 40% of its territory located at sea and hosting marine ecosystems of global significance — including the only coral reefs in the South Atlantic and the world's largest contiguous mangrove belt along the Amazon coast. These ecosystems play a vital role in both climate adaptation and mitigation, serving as natural buffers against extreme weather events and contributing to carbon storage.</p><p><em>“For Brazil, the Blue NDC Challenge represents a key opportunity to strengthen ocean-related climate action and to emphasize the essential role of ocean-based solutions in achieving emission reduction targets. Through this initiative Brazil seeks to advance international cooperation on ocean climate action in the lead-up to COP30, and to underscore the need for all countries to fully integrate the ocean into their national climate strategies,” said <strong>Marina Silva, Brazil Minister for the Environment and Climate Change.</strong></em></p><p><em>“In its recently submitted NDC, Brazil has explicitly included, for the first time, ocean-based climate actions, recognizing the ocean’s critical role in climate regulation. These include the implementation of national Marine Spatial Planning, the enhancement of coastal zone management, and the establishment of programs for the conservation and restoration of mangroves and coral reefs,” she noted.</em></p><p>Governments joining the Blue NDCs Challenge commit to stepping up efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience through ocean-based solutions, while also delivering benefits for both nature and people. Depending on their national context, participating countries may include actions such as:</p><ul><li>Sustainably managing, conserving, and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems - including through marine spatial planning, integrated coastal zone management, and climate-smart marine protected areas;</li><li>Phasing out offshore oil and gas production and expanding clean ocean energy, such as offshore wind, wave, and tidal power - supported by innovation and technology transfer;</li><li>Cutting emissions and strengthening resilience in maritime sectors, including shipping and seafood value chains;</li><li>Supporting sustainable, climate-resilient fisheries and aquaculture to ensure long-term ocean health and food security.</li></ul><p>Governments that join the Challenge will receive support from a wide range of partners and initiatives, including the Ocean Breakthroughs led by the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, the UN High-Level Climate Champions, and the NDC Partnership hosted by World Resources Institute. Together, they aim to boost investment and action in ocean-based solutions to help achieve a net-zero, resilient, and nature-positive future by 2050.</p><p><em>“Ultimately, industrial marine sectors and natural ecosystems are underused tools in addressing climate change and other development needs. As world leaders gather in Nice and prepare for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Belém (COP30), they can take inspiration from the Seychelles in championing ocean-based climate action,” said <strong>Wavel Ramkalawan is President of the Republic of Seychelles.</strong></em></p><p><em>“We are pleased to join the Blue NDC Challenge and work alongside COP30 host, Brazil, as well as France, Fiji, the Republic of Seychelles, Mexico, Palau to highlight the vital role of the ocean in global efforts on climate change,” said <strong>Senator Murray Watt, Australian Minister for the Environment.</strong></em></p><p><em>“This is an important initiative, and we commend France and Pacific countries in their longstanding leadership on this issue. There are significant opportunities in sustainably managing, conserving and restoring coastal and marine ecosystems, among other blue solutions. We acknowledge the links being drawn between the Paris Agreement and the ocean program this year, as we approach a decade of the Paris Agreement.”</em></p><p>Quotes from supporting and endorsing NGOs:</p><p><em>“The ocean already plays a vital role in stabilizing our climate–but it has vast untapped potential to be an even greater part of the solution. From harnessing clean energy like offshore wind to restoring marine ecosystems that store vast amounts of carbon, there are many ways that countries can use ocean-climate solutions to deliver on the Paris Agreement,” said <strong>Janis Searles Jones, CEO of Ocean Conservancy</strong>. \"I thank Brazil for their leadership on the road to COP30. Thank you for launching this Challenge to solidify ocean-based climate solutions as a key part of national climate plans--and to get the resources and assistance needed to make them a reality.\"</em></p><p><em>“Ocean-based climate solutions can deliver up to 35% of the emissions reductions needed to keep 1.5°C within reach. But we are running out of time to maximise the ocean’s potential. That’s why countries must place the ocean at the heart of their climate strategies. We applaud Brazil’s leadership in launching the Blue NDC Challenge, this is a vital step to mobilize ambition, support, and coordination to fully integrate the ocean into national climate plans,” said <strong>Tom Pickerell, Global Director of the Ocean Program at World Resources Institute and Head of the Secretariat for the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.</strong></em></p><p><em>“The Paris Agreement was the beginning – a promise that ambition would grow over time. Ten years on, the time for promises is now over. The Blue NDC Challenge is how we turn Paris ambition into Belém action, by fully leveraging ocean-based climate action,” said <strong>Loreley Picourt, Executive Director, Ocean & Climate Platform.</strong></em></p><p><em>“As the host of the next climate conference, Brazil has a unique opportunity to lead by example with an ambitious, science- and nature-based agenda that amplifies the voices of vulnerable communities. Including the ocean in national commitments — and ensuring their implementation — is essential to addressing the climate crisis with the urgency it demands. We see the Blue NDC challenge, and Brazil’s leadership, as crucial steps toward more effective, integrated, and resilient climate solutions,” said <strong>Marina Corrêa, Oceans Lead at WWF-Brazil.</strong></em><br /> </p>",

      "description": "<p>By midday in Mathare, a densely populated informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, the sun beats down on the tight rows of wooden stalls and corrugated metal rooftops. At an elevation of 5,889 feet (1,795 meters), Nairobi has long been known for its temperate climate. But in recent years, heat has become an unavoidable issue — especially in informal settlements, which can be up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) hotter than the rest of the city.</p><p>In Mathare, local street vendors selling fresh produce and fish once relied on a steady stream of customers throughout the day. Now, the heat often spoils their goods before they can be sold.</p><p>“If they don’t have a quick market, they’re seeing a lot of losses by the end of the day,” said Michelle Koyaro, program associate at Slum Dwellers International (SDI) Kenya. Some vendors have started selling in the cooler evenings, but fewer customers come out during those hours. Instead, after long days under the hot sun, sellers head home with headaches and lean earnings.</p><p><strong>In cities around the world, extreme heat is no longer a short-term event or seasonal disruption. It’s a growing daily pressure that is reshaping how people live, move and work — and it’s getting worse.</strong></p><p>Heat is a well-documented threat to health. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 500,000 people <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health\">die</a> from heat-related causes each year — a number expected to rise by 50% by 2050. But the crisis goes beyond public health: Heat is also undermining economies, infrastructure, social systems and the well-being of residents in cities around the world.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"958\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"767\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"587\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"462\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"277\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Sellers sell fresh produce on the side of the street in Mathare, an informal community in Nairobi, Kenya.\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/51962765079-2af57e3564-k.jpg?VersionId=7w2WQKrfxsnHf7xWRoQqp25vXJHaRuJY&itok=gtPs9Z0Z\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Sellers line a street in Mathare to sell their fresh produce.

Heat is not an isolated issue. To adapt effectively, cities must understand how rising temperatures are transforming and threatening multiple aspects of urban life — and recognize they’re not alone in the challenges they face.</p><p>Already, more than 350 cities worldwide are grappling with summertime temperatures <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cities-where-fight-green-recovery-will-be-won-or-lost\">above 35 degrees C</a> (95 degrees F), and that number will only grow as the climate warms. Cities have enormous potential to learn from one another — what has worked, and what hasn’t — as they adapt to heat and work to mitigate its worst impacts.</p><p>Here, through the lens of four essential sectors — health, transportation, jobs and economic productivity — we examine the cascading impacts of heat in cities and offer tangible, scalable solutions that cities can use to develop effective, far-reaching strategies.</p><h3>Health: Prioritizing Well-Being as Cities Heat Up</h3><p>Anyone who’s spent time outside on an extremely hot day knows how draining it can be — headaches, dehydration, fatigue and trouble concentrating. But what happens when this exposure is constant — not just for a few hours, but every day? The effects on the body can shift from uncomfortable to dangerous.</p><p>Prolonged heat exposure can strain vital organs like the heart and kidneys, disrupt sleep, cause mental stress and worsen chronic conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. Researchers project that long-term heat exposure will become the norm, with parts of Africa, South Asia and Latin America <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/future-extreme-heat-cities-data\">among the most affected</a>.</p><p>Extreme heat poses a particular challenge to low-income urban residents, who may live in poorly ventilated homes or work outdoors. Over the course of a day, prolonged heat exposure compounds the risks they face. Children, <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/07/extreme-heat-makes-pregnancy-more-dangerous/\">pregnant people</a> and older adults are especially vulnerable.</p><p>Addressing these risks requires a multifaceted approach that works in both the short and long term. In the immediate term, cities need to invest in interventions that lower exposure in the places where people spend time or provide options for escaping the heat. Early warning systems, like those in <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/2022/06/23/a-health-based-heatwave-categorizing-and-naming-system/\">Athens</a> and <a href=\"https://ghhin.org/resources/early-warning-system-for-extreme-temperatures-in-argentina/\">Buenos Aires</a>, alert residents to upcoming heat waves and offer practical guidance for staying safe.</p><p>Public cooling centers — community spaces with air conditioning or fans and drinking water — can reduce immediate health threats by providing temporary refuge. In Jodhpur, India, which is coping with intensifying heat waves, a net-zero cooling shelter equipped with misting fans, solar panels and a wind tower that passively circulates cooler air provides relief to those who must be outside. Inside, temperatures are up to <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/vijay-limaye/jodhpur-india-unveils-its-first-net-zero-cooling-station\">12 degrees</a> C (21.6 degrees F) cooler than just outside the door.</p><p>In Phoenix, Arizona — <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/phoenix-americas-hottest-city-is-having-a-surge-of-deaths/\">the hottest city in the United States</a> — a 24/7 cooling center <a href=\"https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2025-03-29/phoenix-will-move-24-7-cooling-centers-including-at-burton-barr-library-to-single-new-location\">drew thousands of visitors</a> during 2024’s hottest period, including unhoused residents, <a href=\"https://chrome-extension:/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5934\">who are far more likely to die from heat-related causes</a>. This site, along with the city’s other heat preparedness efforts — such as connecting people to resources for air conditioning repairs — contributed to <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/07/new-247-cooling-center-opens-downtown-phoenix/\">a 20% drop</a> in heat-related emergency calls. Even brief breaks in cool spaces have been shown to reduce physiological and cardiovascular strain.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Women walk across a sunny street in Athens.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/athens-greece_0.jpg?VersionId=XZjjHUqK.iefE2vKId4MiFMn2NpyZ4pJ&itok=7Ma0iJS8\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>People walk through the streets of Athens, Greece, during the 2022 extreme heat wave.

Cities must also invest in long-term strategies to expand heat-resistant housing and reduce urban heat in places where residents spend time at school, at work or in transit. Increasing urban greenery and tree cover can lower peak temperatures <a href=\"https://development.asia/explainer/how-cities-can-combat-extreme-heat-using-nature-based-solutions\">by up to 5 degrees C</a> (9 degrees F).</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">Health Impact Solution: Understanding and Acting on the Local Relationship Between Place, Population and Heat Health</p><p class=\"secondary\">Emergency measures aren’t enough. Building long-term urban resilience means identifying and addressing who is most vulnerable. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/heat-and-health-brazilian-cities\" target=\"_blank\">WRI is partnering with </a>the Salud Urbana en América Latina <u>(</u>SALURBAL<u>)</u> initiative — a collaboration of research institutions across Latin America and the United States, coordinated by Drexel University — to study how social and environmental factors influence heat-related health outcomes in two Brazilian cities: Campinas and Belo Horizonte. The goal is to help cities design targeted, equitable interventions, such as expanding nature-based solutions and prioritizing health care.</p></div><p>In informal settlements, where rooftops are often made from heat-trapping materials like corrugated steel, participatory upgrading programs — which directly involve residents in improving their own living conditions — can substantially boost resilience and health. For example, research shows that adding cool roof solutions, such as vegetation or reflective surfaces, to informal homes can <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032122001083#:~:text=We%20show%20that%20occupants%20of,of%20annual%20heat%20stress%20exposure.\">reduce residents’ exposure to extreme heat by up to 91% over the course of a year</a>.</p><p>Longer-term efforts to reduce heat exposure and related health risks must be grounded in data that includes the potential for effective solutions. Studies can reveal not only how hot certain areas get but also the many ways communities face heat-related burdens. This helps cities prioritize where to focus resilience measures. </p><h3>Transport: Keeping Cities Moving in a Hotter World</h3><p>An essential part of urban life is the ability to move safely and efficiently through the city. As more cities embrace sustainable, zero-carbon transport options like electric buses, cycling and walking, extreme heat is prompting people to stay home or rely more on cars.</p><p>A 2024 study of several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Atlanta, Houston and New York, found that on extremely hot days, public transportation trips decline by <a href=\"https://www.cockrell.utexas.edu/news/archive/10071-extreme-heat-impacts-daily-routines-and-travel-patterns-study-finds\">an average of 50%</a> as people opt for air-conditioned vehicles. But for many without access to cars, there is no easy escape. Without adequate shade or heat protection at transit stops — a widespread problem in many cities — public transport users face greater risk of heat exposure. In Los Angeles, for example, only one-quarter of bus stops provide shelter despite frequently high temperatures.</p><p>Bicycle use also drops during extreme heat. In New York City, an analysis of bike-share ridership found that usage declined <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768325/\">by about one-third on days when temperatures exceeded 26 to 28 degrees C</a> (79 to 82 degrees F). Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/extreme-heat-air-pollution\">extreme heat can intensify air pollution</a>. This means that when people avoid sustainable transport options on hot days, it contributes to worsening air quality and compounds health risks for the city’s most vulnerable residents.</p><p>Cities must not only promote sustainable transport modes but also ensure that people can travel safely and comfortably, regardless of income or ability. For public transit like buses and light rail, increasing service frequency reduces the time people spend exposed to dangerous heat while waiting. Installing shade structures at transit stops and planting trees or green walls can also help ease heat burdens in these high-use spaces.</p><p>Green corridors — connected strips of green space such as trees, gardens or parks that link different parts of a city — can also create a network of cooler streets for people to cycle or walk on hot days.  Medellín, Colombia, has demonstrated the benefits of integrating urban greenery with sustainable mobility. Since 2016, the city’s Green Corridors program has linked more than 30 major streets with tree cover, vertical gardens and green spaces. Analyses show the corridors reduce temperatures <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/nature-positive-cities-tackle-extreme-heat/#:~:text=The%20green%20corridor%20initiative%20in,increasingly%20popular%20among%20urban%20planners.\">by an average of 2 degrees C</a> (3.6 degrees F), lower air pollution levels and encourage more trips on foot or by bike.</p><p>Similarly, studies in both <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/6/2569\">Houston, Texas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720301888?via%3Dihub#sec0040\">Shenzhen, China</a>, have found that tree canopy coverage and eye-level greenery support higher rates of cycling.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Man on bicycle in Shenzhen.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/shenzhen_0.jpg?VersionId=KxgHjFlEj7OCEIhXuVqNrWyJCWjO0d5P&itok=vm5LIuf3\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A cyclist navigates a street in Shenzhen, China, where research shows that more greenery and canopy cover encourage greater use of bicycles.

For informal or hourly wage workers, heat waves can reduce productivity, compromise work safety and lower incomes. In Dhaka, Bangladesh, for instance, manufacturing sectors such as garment and construction are already seeing <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/hot-cities-chilled-economies-dhaka/\">income losses of around 10%</a> as heat exposure hampers workers’ ability to produce efficiently in warehouses, outdoor work sites or manufacturing facilities. When a worker produces less, they earn less. At the sector level, slower production reduces revenue, which dampens the local economy as a whole.</p><p>The Atlantic Council’s Climate Resilience Center notes that women, especially those in informal jobs, are <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/2025/02/06/women-and-heat-surveys/\">particularly vulnerable to heat-related impacts</a>. In New Delhi’s textile markets, female garment workers spend their mornings sewing and packing bales of clothes for transport using open carts or rickshaws. However, because they aren’t allowed to deliver parcels until the afternoon, they must move during the hottest part of the day — often with their children in tow — exposing themselves to high levels of heat stress.</p><p>To build heat resilience across urban economies, cities need to prioritize both individual and system-level safety. Governments can create policies that protect workers on the job. California’s 2022 Heat Action Plan, for example, outlines recommendations to support safety for both outdoor and indoor workers at increased risk of heat impacts. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/recommendations-health-and-safety-amidst-heatwaves\">a 2024 report</a> from the International Labour Organization offers a suite of heat-related actions that local and national governments can adapt into policy, including mandated breaks, enforcement of cooling and ventilation standards in buildings, and regulations on maximum temperatures workers can be exposed to on the job.</p><p>Cities must also engage with the workers most at risk. In Freetown, Sierra Leone, Chief Heat Officer Eugenia Kargbo has led efforts to install weather-resistant and UV-protective <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/project/freetown-market-shade-cover-project/\">canopies</a> over vendor stalls — many of them run by women — to shield them from the city's heat.</p><h3>Economic Productivity: Heat Runs Up Systemic Costs</h3><p>Extreme urban heat doesn’t just affect individuals; it also carries a heavy price tag for cities as a whole. In the Los Angeles metro area, heat-driven productivity losses are estimated at <a href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/hot-cities-chilled-economies-los-angeles/#:~:text=Under%20current%20conditions%2C%20heat%20and,budget%20of%20USD%2011.2%20billion.&text=This%20is%20expected%20to%20rise%20to%20USD%2011%20billion%20annually%20by%202050.\">$5 billion a year</a>.</p><p>Cities also face rising energy demands, infrastructure damage and increased public health systems expenses. A World Bank report estimates that in Bangkok, a 1 degree C (1.8 degree F) temperature rise could increase energy costs by <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/shaping-a-cooler-bangkok-tackling-urban-heat-for-a-more-livable-city\">17 billion baht</a> (around half a billion U.S. dollars). <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/infrastructure/2023/06/28/455539/some-houston-area-roadways-buckling-under-prolonged-high-heat/\">A 2023 heat wave</a> in Houston caused roads to expand and buckle, leading to costly repairs for both the city and state. In London, a 2022 heat wave exposed a different type of infrastructure vulnerability: As temperatures spiked at 40 degrees C (104 degrees F), data centers at two National Health Service hospitals failed, causing weeks of delays in patient care and <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/outage-at-london-hospitals-cost-nhs-14m-when-heatwave-brought-down-two-data-centers/\">costing the system £1.4 million</a> to fix.</p><p>If cities want to safeguard their economies against heat-related losses, investing in wide-scale resilient infrastructure — such as green corridors, cool roofs and pavements, and strategic shade structures — is essential, along with targeted efforts to protect workers. There is no single quick fix to shield urban economies from heat, but every measure that protects people’s health, maintains transit systems and supports productivity will collectively strengthen the economy.</p><h3>Building Resilience in a Warming World</h3><p>Extreme urban heat is reshaping the very systems that keep cities functioning — from health to transportation to livelihoods. <a href=\"https://thecityfix.com/blog/how-cities-can-beat-the-extreme-heat/\">Building resilience</a> at both the individual and system levels — from the street vendors of Mathare to the bus lines in Chicago — is essential to protecting well-being, sustaining economic stability and ensuring cities can thrive in a hotter world. As they plan for heat resilience, cities can learn from each other’s challenges and successes to prioritize effective, timely solutions.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>LONDON (June 5, 2025) </strong>— Today, the European Union adopted the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/news/commission-adopts-ocean-pact-protect-marine-life-and-strengthen-blue-economy-2025-06-05_en\">European Ocean Pact</a> — a unified strategy that aims to protect the ocean, promote a thriving blue economy and support the communities and livelihoods that depend on the ocean. The Pact comes days ahead of the UN Ocean Conference, where governments will convene in Nice, France to advance ocean action.</p><p>The Pact brings existing and new ocean policies under one coordinated framework, with six priorities: restoring ocean health, boosting the sustainable blue economy, supporting coastal and outermost regions, enhancing maritime security, advancing ocean knowledge and innovation and strengthening EU ocean diplomacy and governance. The EU manages the world’s largest collective maritime area.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Tom Pickerell, Global Director, Ocean Program, World Resources Institute: </strong></p><p>“The Pact sets a strong example for how EU countries can govern their ocean area in ways that improve coastal communities’ lives. It rightly places the ocean at the heart of Europe’s environmental, economic, and geopolitical future.</p><p>“We are encouraged by the Pact’s focus on integrated ocean policies, closer links between science and decision-making and stronger international cooperation. This aligns closely with the ambitions of the Ocean Panel, which includes 18 countries committed to sustainably managing 100% of their national ocean areas. The Pact’s push for ocean innovation, from offshore renewables and blue biotech to circular economy solutions and zero-carbon shipping, marks real progress toward a sustainable blue economy. And the Pact's attention to coastal communities and youth leadership signal that people who depend on the ocean are critical to protecting it.</p><p>“Now bold words must be backed by results. Many commitments lack clear timelines, targets and accountability. On finance, the Pact misses the mark by overlooking key tools such as blue bonds, blended finance and insurance mechanisms — essential for scaling investment and embedding ocean health into Europe’s economies. Without a clear strategy to build capacity in developing countries, its promise of inclusive global progress risks falling short.</p><p>“The EU must now deliver on commitments: support <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/sustainable-ocean-plans/\">national sustainable ocean plans</a>, unlock new funding — especially for vulnerable coastal and island states — and make sure ocean solutions are part of climate and nature action. It should also recognize the importance of blue foods for healthy diets, jobs and resilience.</p><p>“As leaders meet in Nice next week for the UN Ocean Conference, this is a vital moment for countries to restore the ocean’s health. Governments must ratify the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/high-seas-treaty-explainer\">High Seas Treaty</a>, protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 and back efforts to manage all national waters sustainably. With real investment and global cooperation, the EU Ocean Pact can turn ambition into action — at the UN Ocean Conference, at COP30, and beyond.”</p><p><em>Editor’s note: WRI serves as Secretariat of the </em><a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\"><em>High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy</em></a><em> — a group of 18 heads of state and government from countries committed to sustainably managing 100% of their national waters by 2030 — and coordinates the </em><a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\"><em>100% Alliance</em></a><em>, a global initiative co-led by Chile and France that encourages all countries to make that commitment.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p>The ocean makes up nearly 70% of the planet’s surface, bursting with rich biodiversity and natural resources that are vital for both the climate and economies. Yet, beyond national coastlines, protecting much of the ocean has long been a murky endeavor.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, governments, scientists and ocean advocates have worked toward securing a global treaty to protect marine life in the ocean areas that lie beyond countries’ individual jurisdictions. These vast, mostly unregulated waters, known as the high seas, hold huge importance to the health of the planet.</p><p>Finally, in June 2023, the 193 member states of the United Nations adopted the landmark Treaty for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en\">BBNJ agreement</a>), under the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">UN Law of the Sea Convention</a> (UNCLOS).</p><p>Though the text of what is commonly known as the “High Seas Treaty,” has been agreed, the story is far from over. It’s <a href=\"https://highseasalliance.org/treaty-ratification/\">awaiting</a> the political will of 60 countries to ratify it, at which time it will trigger a 120-day countdown, leading to the first Conference of Parties (BBNJ COP) that will determine how it's fully implemented.</p><h3>Why the High Seas Treaty Matters</h3><p>The ambition of the High Seas Treaty has always been immense. Roughly two-thirds of the ocean lies outside any single country’s jurisdiction, forming a collective space teeming with life from microscopic plankton to colossal blue whales.</p><p>The high seas are also home to lucrative natural resources, which countries and companies increasingly seek to explore and exploit, such as critical minerals needed for EV batteries and other low carbon technologies and marine genetic materials that are increasingly sought after to support pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and other innovations.</p><p>Yet, without a binding treaty, the high seas are governed patchwork-style through regional fisheries agreements, shipping conventions and scattered marine protected areas. This leaves critical gaps in protecting marine biodiversity or ensuring developing countries are also benefiting from discoveries made in international water.</p><p>When ratified, the High Seas Treaty will fill critical regulatory gaps and complement national efforts. It will help to guide regional cooperation and link seamlessly to <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/sustainable-ocean-plans/\">sustainable ocean plans</a> for national waters already being delivered by member countries of the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\">High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy</a> (Ocean Panel) and future plans through the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance</a>. Together, they will weave a comprehensive net of ocean stewardship from coastlines to open ocean. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two divers swim near colorful coral reefs.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/coral-reef-high-seas_0.jpg?VersionId=dz33TQ2qAdQictZslfe_Ehf3w7B5jxG9&h=62bc044e&itok=eQ9bfSJ_\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The ocean is full of rich natural resources, like genetic material from coral, that countries and companies are looking to use for everything from pharmaceuticals to new technologies.

MPAs are typically clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystems.</p><p>Many MPAs on the high seas already exist. For example, in 2010, six MPAs were established in the Northeast Atlantic with a total area of 286,200 square kilometers (110,502 square miles) and in 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.asoc.org/campaign/ross-sea-mpa/\">Ross Sea MPA</a> with a total area of 1.5 million square kilometers (600,000 square miles) was established in the Southern Ocean.</p><p>The treaty will also establish a process for proposing new zones for protection via a consultation process, supported by scientific evidence.</p><h4>2) Marine Genetic Resources</h4><p>The treaty will also establish rules for sharing financial and non-financial benefits from the commercial application of genetic material sourced from high-seas marine organisms — such as bacteria, corals or deep-sea sponges — that can be used in medicine, cosmetics, food, and biotechnology. These innovations hold huge potential benefits for human health and wellbeing.</p><h4>3) Capacity Building and Transfer of Marine Technology</h4><p>The High Seas Treaty also supports sharing technology and knowledge developments, particularly to low-income countries that need and request it for conservation and sustainable use to ensure they participate fully in high seas governance.</p><h4>4) Environmental Impact Assessments</h4><p>The treaty will create a process for countries or companies proposing high seas activities — such as deep sea mining in areas beyond national borders — to conduct assessments and follow international standards, that can be shared transparently.</p><h3>Which Countries Have Signed the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>Just ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/un-ocean-conference-key-issues\">third UN Oceans Conference</a> (UNOC), taking place in Nice, France beginning June 9, the treaty was signed by 116 countries and ratified by 32. Those ratifying the treaty include island states such as Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Cuba, Dominica and the Maldives; the European Union and some of its members including France, Portugal and Spain; and other nations such as Chile, Norway and South Korea. More countries are expected to ratify the treaty during the conference.

Photo by the European Commission.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Why Is it Taking So Long for the Treaty to Ratify?</h3><p>Starting in the early 2000s, the United Nations began informal discussions on how to close the regulatory gaps over how to manage the high seas, wrangling over how to share the benefits of its natural resources while ensuring necessary protections.  But the very complexity of coordinating nearly 200 countries meant progress was often incremental, alternately buoyed by breakthroughs and bogged down by competing interests.</p><p>The slow ratification progress highlights both the strengths and limitations of international diplomacy. On the one hand, global consensus ensures that the resulting High Seas Treaty creates a single set of rules for all high-seas users. On the other hand, aligning the diverse interests of small island states, distant water fishing nations and environmental non-profit organizations is inherently time-consuming. Each negotiating text must thread the needle between these interests, with every word or comma potentially sparking months of debate.</p><p>Moreover, the decision-making processes of the UN, anchored in principles of sovereign equality and consensus-building, can struggle to keep pace with the urgent, evolving threats that marine ecosystems face: like the increasing demand for deep-sea minerals, growing plastic pollution and overfishing practices. By the time a treaty is finalized, new pressures may emerge, requiring fresh rounds of technical and legal work.</p><p>Countries, operating within their own jurisdictions — also known as exclusive economic zones, which extend 200 nautical miles from a country’s coastline — can make more immediate progress on conservation and climate initiatives. For example, <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/\">Ocean Panel members</a> are sustainably managing 100% of their national waters. The process for developing these holistic sustainable ocean plans, while not simple, has been faster than multilateral processes. Ocean Panel members are now calling on all coastal and ocean states to replicate this success in their own national waters by 2030 by joining the <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/100-alliance/\">100% Alliance</a>.</p><h3>What’s Next for the High Seas Treaty?</h3><p>At this month’s UNOC, it’s expected that many UN member states will announce either their signing or ratification of the High Seas Treaty. However, for it to be effective, it is crucial that the underlying framework and governance structures are agreed upon before coming into force. The BBNJ Preparatory Commission (BBNJ PrepCom) hopes to fill this gap: shaping the treaty operations and preparing for the first BBNJ COP.</p><p>Governments and negotiators are hoping to develop key recommendations to shape the critical elements of the treaty. This includes forming governing structures; outlining the roles and responsibilities of institutions such as those that provide data, and scientific and technical advice; creating tools and mechanisms to ensure equitable implementation of the treaty; and establishing systems to ensure funding and technical knowledge is distributed so all member states can fully participate.  </p><p>The first BBNJ COP will see these recommendations brought forward and hopefully adopted. It is critical therefore that these meetings are constructive and that a consensus is reached. Only with the relevant governing and financial mechanisms in place can this High Seas Treaty go from a landmark agreement to a fully functioning international treaty that protects the global ocean.</p><p>Management of the ocean needs to be as interconnected as the ocean itself. By weaving together national actions with a robust global treaty, the world can ensure a resilient, equitable and thriving ocean for generations to come.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Energy services are fundamental to socioeconomic development and human well-being. Yet access remains scarce in many parts of the world. In Kenya, <a href=\"https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/country/kenya\">13 million people</a> still lack electricity access, and over 39 million continue to use unhealthy, polluting fuels for cooking.</p><p>WRI, in collaboration with over 300 partners, developed the <a href=\"https://www.energyaccessexplorer.org/\">Energy Access Explorer</a> (EAE) to help bring electricity to unserved and underserved communities. Currently available in eight countries across Africa and Asia, EAE is an online, open-source, interactive platform that enables clean energy players to map energy access gaps, identify high priority areas for energy interventions, and expand access faster and more equitably.</p><p>In Kenya, EAE is already being used to inform the design of County Energy Plans, as mandated by the country's <a href=\"https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/act/2019/1/eng@2019-03-29\">Energy Act of 2019</a>. These plans require granular data on demographics and productive uses of renewable energy to assess current and potential electricity demand. They also require data on infrastructure and resource availability to map energy supply. But this is where current data comes up short: While Kenya has significantly scaled up solar power access in recent years, it does not have detailed information on where small-scale solar PV systems are located. This data is currently only available at coarse resolutions (at the sub-county level rather than building level; Figure 1), which limits inclusive planning efforts.</p><p><strong>Simply put: If energy planners and clean energy businesses don't know which buildings are powered by solar systems, how can they effectively plan for the expansion of energy services to underserved communities?</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1600\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1280\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"980\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"772\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"462\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Map showing household solar power use in Kenya at the county level.\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/kenya-household-solar-pv-map-wri_0.png?VersionId=kSfBEPDLdEU8qRNce1DEdjFQ70jzfvmG&itok=fXxLfzsf\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Illuminating Kenya's Solar Landscape</h3><p>To bridge this knowledge gap, WRI, in partnership with OMDENA, piloted the use of AI and Earth Observation (EO) technologies to generate high-resolution mapping of solar PV systems on building rooftops. We started with in Kilifi County, Kenya; specifically, Kilifi South, where about <a href=\"https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-iv-distribution-of-population-by-socio-economic-characteristics\">1 in 5 people</a> use solar power as their main source for lighting.</p><p>First, we collected data from various sources, including open-access satellite imagery from <a href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-1\">Sentinel-1</a> and <a href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-2\">Sentinel-2</a>, high-resolution images from <a href=\"https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/map-tiles/\">Google Maps Static API</a> images, and publicly available research datasets. Once we gathered the images, we processed them to enhance their quality. This included removing blurry parts or noise and enhancing their resolution. Given the limitations of open-access data, we mainly relied on high-resolution imagery from Google Maps for higher accuracy.</p><p>After enhancing the image quality, we manually labelled the location of solar panels in the high-resolution images using <a href=\"https://earthengine.google.com/\">Google Earth Engine</a> to build a robust training dataset. To increase the variety of training examples, we also divided larger images into smaller sections and applied simple transformations, like rotating or flipping.</p><p>This labeled dataset was then used to train our AI object detection model, built using <a href=\"https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-yolov8/\">YOLOv8</a><sup>1</sup>, which is designed to efficiently and accurately identify solar panels.</p><p>Once the model was trained, we first tested its performance on a separate set of images that had not been used during training. This achieved an accuracy of 94% based on common evaluation methods (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall\">precision, recall and F1 scores</a>). To further assess its real-world applicability, we conducted cross-validation using manually labeled ground truth data from Kilifi South. This step allowed us to measure how well the model could detect solar panels in new, unseen imagery (Figure 2). High precision (the model's prediction was correct in more than 90% of cases) indicated that most detected solar panels were indeed true solar panels, while high recall suggested that the model successfully identified most solar panels present in the images.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1500\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"919\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"433\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Photos of roofs with solar panels next to AI-generated images detecting the panels.\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/solar-pv-detection-model-results-wri_0.png?VersionId=c1nNOSy1O3bjWqFImYcuI.EksHjE4xHY&itok=mgK__MjT\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>We then applied the model to satellite images of Kilifi South sub-county to map the locations of solar panels in the area and create a georeferenced<sup>2</sup> dataset: a digital map layer showing where solar panels are installed.

Estimates indicate that <a href=\"https://oceanpanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/23_Ocean-Panel-Climate-Change_DOI.pdf#page=98\">mCDR could remove</a> billions of tons of carbon per year <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26278/a-research-strategy-for-ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-sequestration\">by midcentury</a>. But this massive potential is paired with an equally large uncertainty about both the efficacy of proposed approaches and the possibility of ecological and social impacts.  </p><p>Marine CDR approaches are in early stages of development today, with all tested close to countries’ coastlines in national waters and very few <a href=\"https://oceanvisions.org/mcdr-field-trials/\">tested at sea</a>. However, as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/U.S.-Marine-Carbon-Dioxide-Removal-Research-Strategy.pdf\">interest in mCDR</a> grows from countries and companies looking to meet net zero and other climate commitments, at-sea testing and deployment of approaches proven safe and effective will likely move into international waters. These waters, known as the high seas, make up around two-thirds of the world’s ocean.</p><p>For any marine carbon dioxide removal activity in the high seas, clear and comprehensive governance will be needed to ensure environmental safety, scientific integrity and compliance with international law. Today, mCDR is governed by the existing international treaties and agreements that protect the ocean and marine life. But because they generally were not written with marine CDR in mind, comprehensive and proactive regulation of marine carbon removal activities may require more specific governance frameworks.</p><h3>The State of mCDR Development and At-Sea Testing</h3><p>Interest and investment in marine carbon removal have been growing over the past few years both <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-carbon-dioxide-removal-us\">in the United States</a> and other countries, like <a href=\"https://cdrmare.de/en/\">Germany</a>, Iceland and Singapore.</p><p>In 2023, the U.S. published the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/interagency-ocean-policy/OCAP_Information\">Ocean Climate Action Plan</a>, a government-wide roadmap to leverage the ocean for climate mitigation. And in late 2024, it released a <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/white-house-noaa-and-other-federal-partners-release-national-strategy-for-marine-CO2-removal-research#:~:text=The%20strategy%20outlines%20how%20the,approaches%20are%20viable%20climate%20solutions.\">national mCDR research strategy</a> to address the objectives in the Ocean Climate Action Plan, including building a sufficient knowledge base about the efficacy and tradeoffs of different marine CDR approaches and developing a robust regulatory framework for their use. The federal government provided an initial <a href=\"https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/fy23-nopp-mcdr-awards/\">$24 million</a> for mCDR research projects in 2023; whether and how this work will continue under the Trump administration is uncertain. </p><p>In Germany, the <a href=\"https://cdrmare.de/en/die-mission/cdrmare-struktur/\">CDRmare project</a>, which runs through 2027, is working to assess if and how mCDR can play a role in removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In the EU, the <a href=\"https://seao2-cdr.eu/\">SEAO2-CDR project</a>, which also runs through 2027, is funded by the EU’s Horizon Europe, a research and innovation program, and includes interdisciplinary work to develop tools and guidelines to help ensure mCDR is developed responsibly and transparently.</p><p>Apart from national and supranational governments, interdisciplinary researchers <a href=\"https://www.agu.org/ethicalframeworkprinciples\">have developed</a> <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/a-code-of-conduct-for-marine-carbon-dioxide-removal-research/\">codes of conduct</a> to ensure responsible research. Groups like <a href=\"https://carbontosea.org/\">Carbon to Sea Initiative</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanvisions.org/our-strategy/remove/\">Ocean Visions</a> are supporting mCDR research with funding and other resources.</p><p>Projects are also beginning to move out of the lab and into the marine environment for testing along national coastlines. One <a href=\"https://subhaslab.whoi.edu/loc-ness/\">mCDR project</a> led by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts is in the process of applying for EPA permits to do ocean alkalinity enhancement testing off the state’s coast. Another project received a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to add <a href=\"https://www.vesta.earth/blog/duckannouncement?ref=tectonic.earth\">carbon-removing alkaline sand</a> offshore in North Carolina. In total, Ocean Visions <a href=\"https://oceanvisions.org/mcdr-field-trials/\">identifies 45 research trials</a> that are either in operation or concluded around the world, and six more than are approved to move forward.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21211827/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>As for projects in the high seas, a <a href=\"https://oceaniron.org/who-we-are/\">non-profit coalition</a> of researchers has announced its <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-will-engineer-the-ocean-to-absorb-more-carbon-dioxide/\">intention</a> to start research trials for ocean iron fertilization in international waters of the Pacific as early as 2026.

The CBD initially <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop?id=11659\">adopted a resolution</a> to ban commercial application of iron fertilization in 2008, and then <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop?id=12299\">expanded that in 2010</a> to ban all climate-related geoengineering activities except for small-scale scientific research studies in a controlled setting. While the resolution is nonbinding, it’s supported by 196 countries and was <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/0e90/5901/8f0161248348f0f8de760f20/cop-16-l-24-en.pdf\">reaffirmed at the UN Biodiversity Summit (COP16</a>), an indication of the strong lack of support for projects that are not “small scale” or “in a controlled setting.”  </p><p>The <strong>London Convention and the London Protocol</strong> focus on limiting dumping or disposal of wastes or other matter into marine waters. Whether mCDR approaches that add material to the ocean for carbon removal are considered dumping is a <a href=\"https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/01/09/international-governance-of-mcdr-small-steps-forward-but-much-more-work-to-do/\">topic of continued debate</a>. The Convention includes a list of materials that cannot be dumped. The Protocol is stricter and includes a list of material that can be dumped (with a permit) and prohibits dumping everything else, with limited carve-outs.</p><p>Following the 2008 CBD resolution, the parties to both the London Convention and the London Protocol <a href=\"https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/LCLPDocuments/LC-LP.1%20(2008).pdf\">passed a resolution</a> agreeing that iron fertilization is within scope for both agreements, but that only legitimate scientific research is allowed. In 2010 the parties <a href=\"https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Environment/Documents/OFassessmentResolution.pdf\">adopted a tool</a> to determine if an activity constitutes legitimate scientific research. And in 2013, an <a href=\"https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/LCLPDocuments/LP.4(8).pdf\">amendment to the Protocol</a> officially banned iron fertilization except for legitimate scientific research, and an annex to that amendment determined that additional marine geoengineering techniques could fall under the scope of the amendment in the future. Only six of the LP’s 55 parties have ratified the amendment so far — fewer than the two-thirds needed to enforce it. This amendment is one of few examples of governance specific to certain mCDR techniques, but the Protocol’s ability to more comprehensively govern mCDR is limited by its overall aim of limiting ocean dumping.</p><p><strong>Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction</strong> is an agreement ratified under UNCLOS that <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-10&chapter=21&clang=_en\">opened for signature in 2023</a> and has not yet entered into force. Its objective is to create a comprehensive framework under UNCLOS to address sustainable use of biodiversity and conservation in areas beyond national jurisdiction. It does this <a href=\"https://illuminem.com/illuminemvoices/the-biodiversity-beyond-national-jurisdiction-treaty-and-its-implications-for-marinebased-carbon-dioxide-removal\">through two mechanisms</a>: environmental impact assessment and area-based management tools, such as marine protected areas that could be used to preclude mCDR testing in areas where no other existing international body has competency.</p><p>For environmental impact assessments, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/sites/default/files/2024-08/Text%20of%20the%20Agreement%20in%20English.pdf\">BBNJ</a> includes more specific requirements than UNCLOS, such as assessing whether the planned activity will have “<a href=\"https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/sites/default/files/2024-08/Text%20of%20the%20Agreement%20in%20English.pdf#page=30\">more than a minor...effect</a>” on the marine environment and determining if the effects are not well understood. If either criterion is met, a screening process would determine whether an environmental impact assessment is needed. Since most mCDR methods have not been well studied, they would <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1217&context=sabin_climate_change\">likely trigger this screening</a>. Under BBNJ, a full environmental impact assessment would include the monitoring and reporting of <a href=\"https://bbnj-mgr.fas.harvard.edu/eias\">economic, social, cultural and human health impacts</a>. Following public comment of potentially affected parties, it would then be up to the state party with jurisdiction over the project to decide if it could go forward.</p><p>Aside from these legal frameworks, <strong>customary international law</strong> <a href=\"https://globalpact.informea.org/glossary/no-harm-rule\">arises from established international practices</a> and is generally binding on all states (unlike earlier frameworks which just apply to countries that are party to each agreement). Some aspects of customary international law are also enshrined in legal frameworks. For example, the “<a href=\"https://globalpact.informea.org/glossary/no-harm-rule\">no harm rule</a>” is included in the CBD, so parties to that agreement must adopt measures to enact these treaties domestically. The “no harm rule” means that all countries are obligated to prevent activities under their jurisdiction from causing significant harm to the territory of other countries and areas beyond the individual jurisdiction and control of countries, such as the high seas.</p><p>These legal frameworks are primarily designed to minimize harm, and mCDR approaches are intended to provide a net benefit to the climate while minimizing local harms. However, current legal frameworks are not designed to weigh that benefit against any harms introduced by the mCDR activity. In this way, current legal frameworks are <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/responsible-informed-ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal\">not well suited</a> to governing mCDR activities.</p><h3>Applying International Legal Frameworks to mCDR in the High Seas </h3><p>Marine CDR activities in the high seas will be <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1430957/full#h7\">governed by the country</a> that <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Legal/Pages/Registration-of-ships-and-fraudulent-registration-matters.aspx\">registered the vessel</a> performing those activities or the country where it is loaded with material for the activities. Countries that are parties to international legal frameworks are obligated to create mechanisms to enforce them domestically. And in some cases, countries that are not parties also have domestic laws implementing these frameworks. For example, the United States is not a party to the London Protocol, but the U.S. EPA’s Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act is a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/london-convention-and-london-protocol-international-treaties-prevent-marine-pollution\">domestic application</a> of the London Protocol’s anti-dumping aims. While the regulation of activities in the high seas would fall under relevant national laws, how the regulation is approached would likely be influenced by ongoing discussions among parties to each legal framework. </p><h6>International framework governance of selected mCDR approaches</h6><table border=\"1\" class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th width=\"91\"><strong>Approach</strong></th><th width=\"149\"><strong>UNCLOS</strong></th><th width=\"156\"><strong>LC/LP</strong></th><th width=\"158\"><strong>CBD</strong></th><th width=\"65\"><strong>BBNJ</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td width=\"91\"><strong>All approaches</strong></td><td width=\"149\">General provisions around protection of the marine environment and marine scientific research.</td><td width=\"156\">General obligation of employing a precautionary approach. mCDR activities could be permissible if deemed to be for purposes other than mere disposal, to not run contrary to the aims of the LC/LP and to constitute “legitimate scientific research.”</td><td width=\"158\">General provisions on identification and monitoring, and environmental impact assessments.</td><td rowspan=\"4\" width=\"65\"><p><em> </em></p><p><em>If passed, all approaches will be subject to spatial regulations established through area-based management tools and could be evaluated through environmental impact assessments.</em></p></td></tr><tr><td width=\"91\"><strong>Seaweed cultivation and sinking</strong></td><td width=\"149\">Regulates the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part12.htm\">new or alien species</a>.

This potential coincides with growing demand for legal clarity on country obligations to address climate change under international law. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea released an <a href=\"https://itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_350_EN.pdf\">advisory opinion</a> in May 2024 emphasizing the responsibility of countries under UNCLOS to prevent, reduce and control greenhouse gas emissions to protect the marine environment, and the International Court of Justice is likely to clarify similar obligations under broader treaties sometime this year. These opinions will dually guide countries’ responsibility to climate action and appropriate caution in mCDR implementation.</p><p>In 2025, discussions about these issues will continue under the London Protocol and the London Convention, <a href=\"http://www.gesamp.org/\">scientific experts</a> under the United Nations will propose a new framework to assess projects, and global forums like the UN Ocean Conference and <a href=\"https://www.ouroceanconference.org/\">Our Ocean Conference</a> will convene ocean experts on topics including mCDR. The coming years will see countries advancing interdisciplinary research, including on the evaluation of social and environmental impacts, informed by <a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/noaa-and-carbon-to-sea-team-up-to-develop-data-management-guidelines-for-marine-carbon-dioxide-removal-projects/\">emerging data-sharing and management guidelines.</a> And, as individual projects move forward, transparent communication within and among countries on the impacts and benefits will provide a greater shared understanding for updating the relevant international governance frameworks to consider this potential climate solution.</p><p><em><strong>Editor's Note: </strong>This article was first published on Feb. 10, 2025.
