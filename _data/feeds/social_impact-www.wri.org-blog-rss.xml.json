      "description": "<p><strong>Belém, Brazil (November 6, 2025)</strong> — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, countries announced three global commitments that recognize and support the role of Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities in protecting forests with increased finance and stronger land rights.</p><p>These <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-forest-pledges-must-center-forest-communities\">landmark pledges</a> include a renewed Forest and Land Tenure pledge for $1.8 billion in funding through 2030; the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment, co-led by Brazil, Norway and Peru, which aims to secure and formally recognize 160 million hectares of land for these communities; and the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), which includes a target requiring 20% of payments to go to Indigenous Peoples and local communities.</p><p><strong>Following is a statement from Wanjira Mathai, Managing Director for Africa and Global Partnerships, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“Together these initiatives demonstrate a massive and welcome shift in recognizing the central role that Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants, and local communities play in protecting the forests that sustain us all. These pledges represent both a matter of justice for these communities, survival for our forests, and necessity for our climate goals.</p><p>“Research shows that when communities have secure land rights, forests flourish. Deforestation rates on lands stewarded by Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00815-2\">up to 26% lower</a> than the global average. These communities steward more than <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-and-local-community-land-rights-protect-biodiversity\">54% of the world’s intact forest</a>, and their lands often hold higher biodiversity and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/amazon-carbon-sink-indigenous-forests\">store more carbon</a>.</p><p>“Yet today communities lack legal recognition for <a href=\"https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Who-Owns-the-Worlds-Land_Final-EN.pdf\">over 1.3 billion hectares</a> of their traditional lands, limiting their access to capital and decision-making power. That’s why the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment is so critical, as it could catalyze political momentum in more countries to set national targets for recognizing land rights.</p><p>“Stronger land rights and more direct access to finance go hand in hand. Only around 10% of the <a href=\"https://landportal.org/library/resources/indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities-forest-tenure-pledge-annual-report-2024\">prior $1.7 billion Forest Tenure Pledge</a> directly reached Indigenous Peoples and local communities. This renewed pledge must ensure more direct access to finance and spur a power shift — from projects designed for communities to solutions led and owned by them.</p><p>“These commitments could be transformative, but only if governments turn these words into action.”</p>",

      "description": "<p>Amid record heat and worsening climate impacts on people’s lives, 2025 is a turning point for global climate action, as countries renew their climate commitments — known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — under the international Paris Agreement. This process reveals whether global ambition to tackle climate change is rising fast enough to meet the crisis head on.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Paris Agreement has delivered meaningful progress. Prior to the agreement, the world was hurtling toward <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming</a> by the end of the century. Ten years after the agreement’s adoption, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/assessing-2025-ndcs\">the latest NDCs</a> and current policies bring us closer to a <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2025\">2.3-2.8 degrees C</a> (4.1-5.0 degrees F) trajectory — modestly better than the previously projected <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024\">2.6-3.1 degrees C </a>(4.7-5.6 degrees F) path.</p><p>Yet even with this shift, we remain far above the 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) guardrail set by the Paris Agreement that can prevent some of the most serious damage from a warming planet. And while some sectors are showing real momentum — including the renewable energy, transport and land-use action reflected in many countries’ NDCs — overall progress is still dangerously slow.</p><p>Every fraction of a degree of warming the planet avoids helps secure a safer, greener future. And the investment required to achieve this is far less than the costs of the alternative path, which would bring increased floods, wildfires, insecure food supplies and destroyed lives.</p><p>At the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, nations must confront the gap between current climate pledges and what is needed to unlock a new economy that’s better for both people and the planet.</p><p>Here, we propose five key actions that countries can rally behind for a credible response:</p><ol><li>Reaffirm 1.5 degrees C and commission a global roadmap for ambition and implementation.</li><li>Accelerate near-term sectoral action to deliver 2030 global goals.</li><li>Mobilize long-term strategies for equitable, resilient transitions to net zero.</li><li>Strengthen intergovernmental initiatives for greater impact.</li><li>Deliver a credible finance package to back ambitious climate goals.</li></ol><p>With countries gathered under one roof, a clear political response will be needed that faces up to the shortfall in ambition and seizes the economic, social and other opportunities that assertive action can provide.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"506\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A sign advertising COP30.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/cop30-belem-brazil_0.jpg?VersionId=FMC6fXCGz6Wr11uocJMkOMWW0GI.q9vu&itok=n0yaO5sK\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>During the 2025 UN Climate Change Conference, countries will need to reaffirm their commitments and create climate plans that will bring the world closer to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree C goal. Photo by Luis War. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>1) Reaffirm 1.5 Degrees C and Commission a Global Roadmap for Ambition and Implementation</h3><p>Acknowledging both the progress underway and the remaining gaps will be essential for sustaining global cooperation for deeper, faster action. As a starting point, COP30 should reaffirm that 1.5 degrees C remains the guiding star for global climate action. By doing so, it can send a clear political signal that the goal continues to be the benchmark for assessing progress toward achieving a healthy, livable and resilient world.</p><p>But underscoring those objectives alone will not be enough; COP30 will also need to spur implementation and drive ambition toward 1.5 degrees C in ways that ensure a just and inclusive transition. At COP30, countries could agree to develop a “<em>Global Roadmap for Accelerated Implementation”</em>— a forward-looking gameplan that identifies the pathways, policies and enabling conditions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.</p><p>The roadmap can draw on findings from the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/explaining-global-stocktake-paris-agreement\">Global Stocktake</a> and insights from the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/the-direction-of-travel-improving-every-year-but-we-need-to-urgently-pick-up-the-pace-un-climate\">NDC Synthesis Report</a> to identify specific near-term and transformational opportunities for accelerating emissions reductions across key sectors such as energy, forests, transport and methane, while scaling up adaptation, resilience and just transition efforts — with a particular emphasis on the tremendous economic, social and other benefits that can be seized from taking climate action.</p><p>To underpin this process, the COP30 and COP31 presidencies could convene a high-level dialogue, anchored by technical analysis, to examine how different pathways, timelines and investment conditions can shape an equitable, systemwide transformation. The process could culminate next year at COP31 with the publication of a clear, actionable roadmap that identifies opportunities for urgent action, the sectors with the greatest potential for impact and the actors best placed to drive it forward.</p><h3>2) <span>Accelerate Near-Term Sectoral Action to Deliver 2030 Global Goals </span></h3><p>Building on the roadmap for accelerated implementation, COP30 will also need to encourage countries to achieve near-term sectoral delivery by 2030. The task will involve translating collective signals from the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/explaining-global-stocktake-paris-agreement\">Global Stocktake</a> and the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma5_auv_8a_gga.pdf\">UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience</a> — along with the direction provided by the proposed global ambition and implementation roadmap mentioned above — into concrete economic planning, national policies and investments that can accelerate on-the-ground progress and deliver on the benefits of taking action.</p><p>At COP30, countries could be called upon to voluntarily develop near-term sectoral strategies and progress updates that translate and build upon their existing NDCs, turning national climate goals into concrete pathways for implementation. These strategies and updates could be submitted on a voluntary basis by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to inform the second Global Stocktake, which begins at the end of 2026 and concludes in 2028.</p><p>For the greatest impact, these strategies should be focused on the priority areas highlighted in the Global Stocktake for 2030 (e.g., tripling renewable energy capacity, doubling energy efficiency, transitioning away from fossil fuels, driving down transport emissions, and halting and reversing deforestation, among others), as well as the thematic areas of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience (e.g., water, health, ecosystems and biodiversity, and infrastructure).</p><p>While these global priorities are shared, their emphasis will naturally vary by country. Sectoral strategies can be used to set each country’s own specific plans, policies, investment priorities, support needs and enabling reforms needed to strengthen near-term actions. Most importantly, these strategies are a key opportunity to describe the actions that can seize the substantial benefits for the economy and people’s lives.</p><h3>3) Mobilize Long-Term Strategies for Equitable, Resilient Transitions to Net Zero</h3><p>Long-term climate strategies — or long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS or LTS) — are a critical bridge between NDCs and the collective objective to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Countries have already established 2030 targets and this round of NDCs sets emission-reduction targets through 2035, a key waypoint on the path to mid-century and the net zero goals set by many countries, most notably all of the Group of 20 major economies (G20). As countries move toward net zero, LT-LEDS allow them to outline key sectoral transformations and show how these steps can drive economic growth in the decades ahead, informing and spurring the policy decisions that governments take now.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>WRI COP30 Resource Hub</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"COP30 resource hub graphic.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/cop30-hub-preview_0.png?VersionId=gSWYoSpsmJpMuxUtgzYUWTpUeOAVwJ0E&itok=nRsU6JTv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">Watch our Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>Now more than ever, these strategies are essential for helping countries focus on the sectors that have a domino effect across the wider economy such as energy, food and agriculture, and transport. So far, nearly <a href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/lts-explore\">80 countries</a> have developed and submitted long-term strategies — but fewer than 10 have updated their initial plans, and more than 100 have yet to produce one.</p><p>COP30 can be a turning point, calling on all countries to submit or update LT-LEDS by COP31, treating the strategies not just as paperwork but as catalysts for real sectoral transformation, fully integrated into economic policies, development strategies and finance plans. G20 countries, in particular, should lead by example by developing implementation pathways that align their near-term goals (e.g., 2030 and 2035) with just transition toward their national net-zero and resilience goals. These pathways should also be integrated into national development objectives and processes.</p><h3>4) Strengthen Intergovernmental Initiatives for Greater Impact</h3><p>Throughout the year, the COP30 presidency has brought renewed attention and momentum to the <a href=\"https://cop30.br/en/action-agenda\">Action Agenda</a> of initiatives outside the UNFCCC negotiations. Most important, it has sought to connect climate action initiatives and coalitions — including those involving national governments — to the formal COP process by aligning them with the themes of the first Global Stocktake on energy, forests, and more.</p><p>At COP30, there’s an important opportunity to place greater attention on the role of intergovernmental <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/assessing-intergovernmental-climate-initiatives-expectations-based-framework\">cooperative initiatives and coalitions</a> and integrate them more fully into the Action Agenda, which has previously focused on initiatives by non-state actors. The number of these initiatives and coalitions has grown rapidly in recent years, and governments should now explore their impact and lessons.    </p><p>COP30 can also play an important role in fostering transparency for these intergovernmental initiatives and coalitions, encouraging and driving regular reporting, including through the UNFCCC <a href=\"https://climateaction.unfccc.int/\">Global Climate Action Portal</a>.  During future COPs, dedicated events can allow these initiatives to share their successes, experiences, lessons and best practices.</p><h3>5) Deliver a Credible Finance Package to Back Ambitious Climate Goals</h3><p>Delivering a strong package of finance outcomes at COP30 will signal that the support needed to turn ambition into action is within reach. This includes progress on the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/workstreams/baku-to-belem-roadmap-to-13t\">Baku-to-Belém Roadmap</a> — a collective pathway for scaling climate finance for developing countries from all sources through 2035 — which can spur action on key issues such as the cost of capital. Such progress would send a powerful signal that international public and private finance will flow to countries that step up ambition and translate this into strong domestic finance and public policy signals.</p><p>A key signal at COP30 would be the creation and further strengthening of country platforms as a way to align domestic and international finance, facilitate an enabling policy environment for investment across key sectors, develop investible pipelines, engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders and optimize the use of concessional finance to de-risk projects and unlock capital flows. This way, countries can integrate proposed climate plans into broader economic frameworks and promote an enabling environment for all finance flows to support progress towards climate commitments while strengthening countries’ development pathways.</p><h3>Building an Actionable Future</h3><p>The gaps are clear, but so is the opportunity for getting closer to the goals of the Paris Agreement. COP30 gathers the world’s leaders armed with the tools to close the emissions and ambition gaps. What’s needed now is bold political action and a strong response to the NDCs to restore confidence in multilateralism, set the world more firmly on course to achieve climate goals and ensure shared prosperity from taking that action. The legacy of the Belém COP will rest in large measure on doing so. </p>",

Brazil has set a $125 billion target for the TFFF, and aims to raise $10 billion initially from governments and philanthropies, which would spur further investments from private, corporate and philanthropic investors.</span><br /><br /><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Following is a statement from Mirela Sandrini, Interim Executive Director, WRI Brasil:</strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“From the Amazon to the Congo to Southeast Asia, the forests that sustain us all are facing a </span><a href=\"https://gfr.wri.org/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">global red alert</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">. If enough countries contribute, this new mechanism could offer a breakthrough, flipping the economics of deforestation by making standing forests more profitable than clearing them.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The backing from almost 50 countries is encouraging and marks an important start for the TFFF, reflecting growing recognition of the need for collective action to protect and restore tropical forests. However, the pool of those that have actually committed funding so far remains limited. Broader support will be essential if the Facility is to become fully operational. It is the ultimate test of whether nations — especially wealthier ones — will recognize their shared responsibility for protecting the forests that underpin every economy on Earth. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“As COP30 gets underway<strong>,</strong> new contributions in the coming days would be welcome news, strengthening the initial momentum.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The Facility will only work if it truly benefits the Indigenous Peoples and local communities who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The provision requiring 20% of payments to go to Indigenous Peoples and local communities is a strong start.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Raising money isn't enough, though. The next step is to design the operations manual, with transparent oversight and measures to prioritize and protect intact rainforests, while genuinely involving Indigenous Peoples and local communities. It must also deal with degradation – when forests are weakened by logging, mining or building roads – and leakage – where protecting one area simply shifts destruction elsewhere. Without that precision, the Facility risks being another good-intention promise, not a breakthrough.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Importantly, the TFFF is designed by and for the Global South, reflecting local realities and priorities. It sets a precedent for tropical countries to shape their own climate solutions while responsibly engaging global capital markets. This is not just another fund: it embodies the broader shifts our financial system needs — attracting existing capital toward smart, climate-positive, and secure investments.”</span> </p>",

      "description": "<p>When floods hit my hometown in Kenya last year, it was the poorest communities who suffered most. In Nairobi, where more than 3 million people live in vulnerable homes made of wood, sheet metal and concrete — many in low-lying flood plains — the waters faced little resistance. Entire homes were swept away as people slept.</p><p>The world’s housing and climate crises are deeply intertwined, wreaking havoc and reshaping life in cities around the world — from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-flooding-severe-weather-climate-change-b2b37cbfb1d22dd782976a6c392ecf91\">tragic flooding in Mexico</a> to record-breaking <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-hot-india-climate-temperature-weather-85bab3f13c7bbf16f972ecf51fe9dd9b\">heat waves</a> in India. Urban communities are on the frontlines of climate extremes, bearing the brunt of escalating impacts. And while they have long been hubs of innovation and climate leadership, they cannot tackle this crisis alone.</p><p>The lesson is clear: National governments need to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/multilevel-action-community-led-climate-resilience-informal-settlements\">partner with cities to address the world’s housing and climate crises</a> simultaneously. Poor-quality housing in highly vulnerable areas, combined with little to no access to basic services, creates a pernicious triple blow. The impacts ripple across urban and national economies.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Floods wiped out dense housing near the river in the Mathare neighborhood of Nairobi. \" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/flooding-aftermath-mathare-kenya_0.jpg?VersionId=LbRg7XW5QiDKDQ9Wafl5.Hc__eZWWpxA&itok=9MyikMtR\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>After flooding in the neighborhood of Mathare, Nairobi, wiped out dense housing near the water, residents are working to stabilize the riverbank through greening and restoration.

For others, the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">COP30 UN climate summit</a> in Brazil offers a launchpad to reimagine urban leadership and commit to bold- and inclusive action. In doing so, nations can unlock the power of cities as a major force in climate-resilient economic growth.</p><p>Today, cities produce 80% of global GDP, and they’re on track to house two-thirds of humanity by 2050. Yet in low-income countries, <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.SLUM.UR.ZS\">more than 60%</a> of urban residents —over 1.1 billion people — live in informal settlements, sometimes called “slums.” That means 1 in 8 people on Earth lack resilient homes and basic infrastructure, making these communities uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>So too are urban economies. The informal sector, despite being disregarded by policymakers for generations, is the lifeblood of many cities. It accounts for <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/7-transformations-more-equitable-sustainable-cities\">50% to 80% of urban employment</a> across the Global South. Informal businesses and services, like minibus operators and water deliverers, fill the gaps when formal municipal services don’t reach households.</p><p>On the frontlines of heat waves, landslides and floods, these neighborhoods often pioneer resilience-building efforts with resourceful, frugal innovations. In Nairobi’s Kibera neighborhood, <a href=\"https://prizeforcities.org/project/kibera-public-space-project\">12 community-managed public spaces</a> serve as first responder hubs, tame floodwaters and bring vital services to families, like laundry areas and small business kiosks.</p><p>Locally led initiatives like these should help shape cities’ formal climate efforts, which should in turn feed into – and be supported by – national governments. Yet informal settlements are almost universally left out of national climate plans and funding. Only <a href=\"https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/NDC-Report-Oct-9.pdf\">16 countries</a> mentioned informal settlements in their previous national climate plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Flooding in an informal settlement in Jakarta, Indonesia\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/informal-settlement-indonesia_0.jpg?VersionId=Sqh.P9Vydo607SRNlpHtJK5XE7ZmVYO4&itok=Nn3lBYO7\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Flooding in an informal settlement in Jakarta, Indonesia, in March 2025.

These actions would not only help alleviate poverty and inequality, but also keep people safer when the next flood or heat wave strikes.</p><p>Bringing communities into national climate plans can also unlock more funding for local priorities like housing. Through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multi-Level Partnerships (CHAMP) </a>, Kenya’s national government worked with local counties on its latest climate plan and now prioritizes flood control in informal settlements. It has also set up a much-needed mechanism to funnel resources for climate adaptation to vulnerable communities.</p><p>The momentum is building: <a href=\"https://www.champ-climate.org/\">77 countries</a> have now committed to CHAMP, promising a greater role for partnership between national and local governments.</p><p>The UN holds a vital key to unlocking urban transformation. By spotlighting urban action and informal settlements in future Global Stocktakes — and elevating these issues within international development frameworks like the post-2030 Agenda — the UN can galvanize national governments to close the urban equity gap.</p><p>At COP30, the ministerial round table on housing and informal settlements is a key step in the right direction. Its recommendations could steer overdue resources and adaptation finance to this long-overlooked agenda.</p><p>With these foundations in place, cities will be better positioned to improve climate resilience while supporting the hundreds of millions of people who live in informal neighborhoods and power their economies. They can team up with neighborhood groups and urban poor associations to create higher-quality housing and improve livelihoods — while scaling these efforts by partnering with national governments.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/iloilo-city-philippines-housing-flood-protection\">Iloilo City, the Philippines</a> provides one blueprint. In the wake of Typhoon Fengshen, which submerged 80% of the city, the local government and local NGOs partnered to provide land, organize savings groups, finance, and co-design new housing projects. Almost two-thirds of the city’s poor families were settled in higher-quality housing without forced evictions or distant relocations. Since then, Iloilo City’s community-led housing projects have inspired similar projects in a dozen cities across the Philippines.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"828\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"663\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"400\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"239\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Iloilo City, Philippines\" height=\"239\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/iloilo-city-philippines_0.jpg?VersionId=d.B6VEFf7NNcvgIVDuWb3k6CQyow5F4g&itok=ynBRjOQY\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A community-led housing project in Iloilo City, Philippines.

      "description": "<p>At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit in Brazil, the nations of the world agreed as part of the <a href=\"https://www.mauricestrong.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=169:rio-statement-forests-management&catid=39&Itemid=89\">Forest Principles</a> to provide financial resources for conservation efforts in developing countries with significant forest areas. Yet for more than three decades, the international community has struggled — <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/state-finance-forests-2025\">and largely failed</a> — to fulfill that commitment, particularly to developing nations with tropical rainforests.</p><p>These tropical forests are home to a majority of the planet’s biodiversity, play a crucial role in combating climate change and are critical to people’s livelihoods. Between 2002 and 2022, according to <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/forest-insights/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2022/\">Global Forest Watch data</a>, the world’s tropical humid primary rainforests shrunk by 8%, losing an area equivalent to nearly the size of Pakistan. This magnitude of loss has continued unabated, except in a few key tropical rainforest countries such as Brazil and Indonesia.</p><p>The basic challenge continues to be one of simple economics: Cutting and clearing natural forests for timber and agriculture is generally more profitable than leaving trees standing.</p><p>Conventional business practices are not designed to tangibly value and reward the conservation of forests, or their biodiversity and ecosystem services. Combined with continuing global demand for commodities, harmful subsidies in many countries, and weak and/or <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/nature-crime-amazon-deforestation\">corrupt forest governance practices</a>, this dynamic has increasingly degraded and destroyed the Earth’s tropical forests.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Illegal logging in the Amazon.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/deforestation-illegal-logging-tfff_0.jpg?VersionId=SFvysLo0joVnaOCndNXDKcdUEkzqjOx0&itok=gUi_AuqT\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>According to data from Global Forest Watch, between 2002 and 2022, the world’s tropical humid primary rainforests shrunk by 8%.

The <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/\">Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> (TFFF), which formally <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-launches-tropical-forests-forever-facility\">launched on Nov. 6</a>, is designed as a “payment-for-performance” model that uses agreed satellite monitoring standards and systems to reward tropical forest countries with a continuing source of funding as long as they preserve their forests.</p><p> While other forest conservation mechanisms such as <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-redd\">REDD+</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/carbon-markets-tropical-forest-conservation\">carbon markets</a> focus on rewarding emissions reductions, the TFFF takes a different approach. It aims to pay tropical forest countries directly for each hectare of standing forest they maintain, with payments decreasing based on any deforestation or fire-related forest degradation.</p><p>With Brazil’s leadership, the momentum of this year’s annual <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30)</a> taking place in the Amazon, and with effective new satellite monitoring technologies, the TFFF could finally turn forest conservation into an investment that benefits countries, investors and the planet.</p><p>Following several years of technical and diplomatic work, Brazil published the latest iteration of the <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/feedback/\">TFFF Concept Note</a> in October 2025. Just weeks before, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/brazilian-government-announces-us1-billion-contribution-to-the-tropical-forest-forever-facility-tfff/\">announced</a> at the UN General Assembly that Brazil would make the first $1 billion investment into the facility, which ultimately is expected to reach $125 billion. A few weeks later, <a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesia-vows-to-invest-in-brazilled-125-billion-forestry-fund\">Indonesia announced</a> it would also contribute to the facility, following up just a few days before COP30 is set to begin with a $1 billion commitment. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/norway-invest-3-billion-tfff-forest-conservation-fund-2025-11-06/\">Norway</a>, on the same day, also announced a $3 billion pledge. The TFFF’s success now depends on other nations, as well as private sector investors, to make it a reality at COP30 and beyond. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1048\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"838\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"642\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"506\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Tropical forest in Nepal.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/tropical-forest-nepal_0.jpg?VersionId=zKDCyfDMoLENNHPhj3gpyzF6sBxWx8hW&itok=a6sC06XW\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Tropical Forest Forever Facility is an innovative fund designed to reward countries for keeping their forests standing. Photo by Teo Tarras/Shutterstock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How Exactly Will the TFFF Be Funded?</h3><p>Unlike most previous international assistance to conserve tropical forests, the TFFF will not be financed by donor grants. Once the facility reaches its $125 billion target (or, likely in the shorter term, a smaller sum), it will be the world’s largest “<a href=\"https://ppp.worldbank.org/blended-finance\">blended finance</a>” mechanism of its kind, designed to pay eligible, participating tropical forest countries annually for maintaining their deforestation rates below 0.5% per year, as measured by agreed geospatial monitoring standards and systems.</p><p>The TFFF will borrow an initial capital base (targeted at $25 billion) from traditional “donor” nations and other countries in a position to invest, such as Brazil and China, and potentially philanthropic foundations, too. These “sponsors” would provide 40-year loans (the facility’s capital), or other comparable investment modalities, at an interest rate comparable to the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds (a 30-year bond is currently less than 5%) and would be the first to take responsibility over any losses in what’s known as a junior position in the debt structure.</p><p>This arrangement creates a safety net that enables the fund to raise an additional $100 billion from private, corporate and philanthropic investors. The combined $125 billion would then be invested in fixed income emerging markets and other sovereign and corporate bonds (excluding fossil fuels and other environmentally destructive sectors), which would earn a higher return.</p><p>The return is ultimately expected to generate some $3 billion to $4 billion per year — enough to make payments of around $4 per hectare of conserved forest to eligible countries which maintain deforestation rates below 0.5% over the long term. (Even in the short term, with a much lesser sum than $125 billion, the payments generated would still be significant.)</p><p>The TFFF governance structure is divided into the Tropical Forest Investment Fund (TFIF), managed by the World Bank under a separate governance structure that would manage the investment fund and determine the availability of funds for forest payments; and the TFFF itself, which would coordinate monitoring and reporting, and distribute forest payments to countries.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1350\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1080\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"827\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"651\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"390\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"How the TFFF will work\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/25-10-22-tfff-v5-facility.png?VersionId=vrP4qkdp6nddRmbMe0AkxRafdldSa9ua&itok=BsbpCBE8\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Where Would the Money Go?</h3><p>The current TFFF proposal includes 74 UN-listed developing countries that combined are home to more than 1 billion hectares of moist, broadleaf tropical and sub-tropical forests.</p><p>The TFFF is not designed to fund countries to reduce their deforestation rates. Rather, it is meant to reward those that already have relatively low deforestation rates, providing a financial incentive to keep their remaining tropical forests standing and prevent any further deforestation. However, if it’s successful, the facility will serve as encouragement for countries with currently high deforestation rates to qualify to join the scheme. A good result would be if countries such as Bolivia, with one of the world’s highest deforestation rates, were able to qualify for TFFF funding in the years to come. The current structure would lead to significant flows of finance to some of the world’s poorest forest countries, including in Africa’s Congo Basin.</p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1350\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"1080\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"827\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"651\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"390\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Countries Eligible for TFFF Payments\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/25-10-22-tfffv2-map.png?VersionId=pg93T2bHxPq7qDuaA_zbHpgPySYhF5iU&itok=l2mvS7Kn\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The TFFF includes several innovative features focused on where the money should go. The first is that it allows countries to allocate TFFF payments as they see fit on their national policies and programs that, directly or indirectly, contribute to tropical and subtropical forest conservation and forests’ sustainable use. Crucially, the TFFF requires countries to disclose what the funds are used for to ensure transparency and allow for public scrutiny and feedback.</p><p>Another striking and positive feature is a provision requiring 20% of payments to go to Indigenous peoples and local communities engaged in tropical forest conservation in eligible countries. This could be the single biggest source of international finance for Indigenous peoples and local communities, so often at the frontline of conservation. This finance could help these communities protect their rights, secure land tenure, tackle illegal mining and criminality, and pursue sustainable alternative livelihoods that are not dependent on clearing areas of forest.</p><p>It is also significant because the TFFF is the only such source of funding that could in some instances be accessed directly by Indigenous peoples and local communities — a provision that they have repeatedly asked for, granting these communities decision-making over the use of the funds.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"955\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"764\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"585\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"461\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"276\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A family in a canoe rows away from a house along a river in the Amazon, Brazil.. \" height=\"276\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/indigenous-family-amazon-tfff_0.jpg?VersionId=9S.bQ9yFUhfzS6npROa9nT01ywtFUsTM&itok=tjGif8nR\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Payments from the TFFF could help protect the rights of Indigenous communities and help them pursue sustainable alternative livelihoods that are not dependent on clearing areas of forest. Photo by Dekaro/iStock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How Will Forests Be Monitored?</h3><p>The TFFF can only succeed if it is built on credible, transparent and operational forest monitoring that relies on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/indigenous-peoples-local-communities-use-satellite-data-deforestation\">satellite data</a>. This requires methods and data that are produced in a way that can be verified, applied consistently through time and comparable across countries. Robust and universally applied technical standards must be established from the outset, not only to ensure credibility but also to build investor confidence that will attract the early capital needed for scale.</p><p>A core principle of the TFFF is that participating nations are expected to use their own national forest monitoring systems, provided these systems meet established quality and transparency criteria. For countries without a qualifying national system, a compliant third-party system, such as <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch</a> (managed by WRI) or the EU’s Joint Research Center tropical forests platform, may be used. Given this diversity in monitoring approaches, establishing agreed common methodological standards and definitions across all systems will be paramount.</p><p>The TFFF also proposes a fixed forest definition to be applied across all participating countries, creating a common basis for how forests are measured and valued. By setting a 20% to 30% canopy density threshold, a 5-meter minimum tree height and by excluding plantations, this definition establishes a solid technical foundation for consistent and comparable measurements.</p><h3>What’s Still Needed to Launch the TFFF?</h3><p>First, sponsors need to follow Brazil’s and Indonesia’s lead and commit contributions to the initial hoped-for $25 billion tranche of junior capital. If additional sponsors fail to make commitments at COP30, the TFFF may lose momentum in 2026, causing private sector investors to doubt the viability of the model.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>WRI COP30 Resource Hub</strong></p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"800\" />\n              <source height=\"428\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"256\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"COP30 resource hub graphic.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/cop30-hub-preview_0.png?VersionId=gSWYoSpsmJpMuxUtgzYUWTpUeOAVwJ0E&itok=nRsU6JTv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>WRI’s experts are closely following the UN climate talks. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\">Watch our Resource Hub</a> for new articles, research, webinars and more.</p></div><p>It is therefore vitally important for industrialized nations across the world without tropical forests to make a significant financial commitment to this bold and ambitious idea. The stakes are global: If tropical forests are lost, adaptation costs from the ensuing climate impacts would far exceed these investments. For wealthy nations, investing in the TFFF is not only about justice and responsibility, but also a matter of economic self-interest. Tropical forests are, in addition to being sovereign national assets, a global public good, with a universal responsibility for their protection.</p><p>The World Bank Board has agreed to manage the funds <a href=\"https://tfff.earth/the-world-bank-confirmed-as-trustee-and-interim-host-of-the-tropical-forest-forever-facility/\">as the trustee and interim host</a> of the TFFF and formalized initial arrangements at its October 2025 meeting, which should provide a strong confidence signal for both sponsors and the private sector. But the World Bank will have to move rapidly to establish the TFIF to maintain momentum and move toward an operational phase of the facility.</p><p>Once all of that is in place, a key priority will be development of the operations manual that will govern how the TFFF actually works, including work on some of the more difficult technical issues. These include:</p><h4>Degradation and Leakage</h4><p>Not all forest loss is caused by deforestation. Forest degradation, which plays a major role in carbon loss and ecosystem decline (and often occurs at smaller spatial scales) can also take place.</p><p>Currently, the TFFF proposes to only consider fire-damaged areas (using burn scars as a proxy) as indicators of degradation, subsequently reducing payments by a 1:35 discount rate. But other degradation factors, such as selective logging, roadbuilding, mining and some edge effects, can be detected using 30-meter or 10-meter satellite data. Including both fire and non-fire degradation would strengthen the system’s integrity and ensure payments reflect actual forest conditions.</p><p>Deforestation “leakage” is another thorny issue: the TFFF focuses on broadleaf tropical and sub-tropical forests, the most important forests globally for both biodiversity and climate change. However, there is worry that this might cause deforestation to move into other biomes not covered by the TFFF — <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/01/brazils-soy-moratorium-dramatically-reduced-amazon-deforestation/\">Brazil’s Cerrado</a> and southern Africa’s Miombo woodlands are good examples — without notice or punitive measures. The TFFF seeks to address this by requiring participating countries to monitor and report forest cover changes in non-TFFF forest areas where significant increases in deforestation could trigger additional scrutiny and potential payment holds. Though this is a good conceptual solution, implementation could be complex given, among other issues, the difficulties associated with monitoring deforestation in drier or sparser forest landscapes. More work will be needed to ensure that the TFFF does not simply displace, rather than prevent, forest loss.</p><h4>Consideration for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities</h4><p>It will also be critical to maintain a strong consultative process with civil society and <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/global-forest-pledges-must-center-forest-communities\">Indigenous communities</a> as the TFFF — particularly its operations manual — is developed and moves toward implementation. Much of civil society is supportive of the TFFF and its efforts to engage Indigenous peoples and local communities; some remain critical and circumspect. There is no formal consensus on the TFFF among the diverse Indigenous peoples’ organizations across the world’s tropical forests. Continuing dialogue, consultation and free, prior and informed consent will therefore be critical in the years ahead.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A home along a river in Belém, Brazil.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/indigenous-communities-tfff-belem-brazil_0.jpg?VersionId=QGioHVL8kk__CcBgiuUXbIWROMY8GRDD&itok=fsP8-bKz\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A home along the Guama River in Belém, Brazil, where COP30 will take place. The TFFF will require that 20% of payments to countries that keep deforestation rates below 0.5% to go to Indigenous peoples and local communities.

It is only in the past decade that credible, affordable satellite monitoring of forest cover has emerged. And there are no international covenants or treaties designating official satellite monitoring standards or systems.<br /><br />In developing its monitoring standards, the TFFF should consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine-tuning its measurement standards </strong>by aligning the standard minimum mapping unit with the pixel resolution of existing, free satellite data archives (30-meters or 10-meters) to provide a more accurate picture of forest dynamics. Using a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/rethinking-definition-forest-monitoring\">finer mapping unit</a>, instead of the proposed 1-hectare minimum mapping unit, would also enable more effective monitoring of forest degradation events like logging and roadbuilding.</li><li>Ensuring that the monitoring systems that underpin the TFFF’s payment calculations provide <strong>open, independently verifiable data</strong>; use methods that produce data that are transparent and reproducible; and regularly validate the results using good practice and international reporting guidelines.</li><li>Finally, <strong>governance will be critical </strong>to help ensure that technical decisions remain evidence based. The TFFF’s operations manual will codify the detailed rules and procedures for monitoring, so its development should include structured opportunities for expert and stakeholder input.</li></ul><p>In short, there is a clear pathway: strong technical standards, robust degradation monitoring, validation, open data and shared governance. The technology is ready; what is needed now is collective agreement to put it into practice.</p><h3>The TFFF’s Critical Contribution to the Global Forest Challenge</h3><p>In summary, the TFFF could make a potentially critical contribution to addressing the world’s forest challenges, which are so closely linked to the biodiversity and climate crises we face. But, as the TFFF proponents themselves have noted, it is not a panacea; other forms of finance will also be needed, and of course there are many other dimensions of tackling tropical forest loss, including governance, legality, regulation, demand and consumption shifts.</p><p>The TFFF also inherently faces risks in a volatile world where the future of economies and markets cannot be predicted; it is a bold idea at a time of volatility and instability. But after more than 30 years of forest conservation, forest finance commitments and arrangements that have yet to turn the tide, the TFFF presents an ambitious idea from a major rainforest country that has real potential to make a potentially transformative impact in conserving tropical forests.</p><p>It is therefore a pressing global imperative for the international community to contribute generously to its success, starting at COP30, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest — a tropical rainforest, like others, on which the future well-being of humanity so profoundly depends. </p><p><em>This article was originally published on Oct. 27, 2025.

      "pubDate": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:15:39 EST",
      "description": "<p>Much of the conversation around wind power often focuses on large-scale utility wind farms that provide energy to power grids deployed across cities, regions and even countries. Yet, smaller wind solutions can play a very important role in the clean energy transition.</p><p>In places where solar and other renewable technologies are not technically or economically feasible, small wind projects are a cost-effective option that can help power individual homes, schools and health facilities, or provide reliable and affordable electricity to entire communities. They can also support water pumping for irrigation, telecommunications and small businesses.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gramvikas.org/project/small-wind-energy-system-for-rural-energy-access/\">two small wind energy systems</a> installed in the tribal villages of Kamalaguda and Tijmali in the Kalahandi district of Odisha, India, not just provide electricity to 60 homes and 259 people, but brought jobs and new skills to the community.</p><p>Across the world, 11 miles off the coast of Maine, the Fox Islands community has installed <a href=\"https://www.foxislandswind.com/about-fiw\">three 1.5 megawatt turbines</a> to power their homes and businesses. During the first 14 years of the project, local residents saved around $1.3 million in electricity costs.</p><p>Currently <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/small-wind-market#:~:text=The%20global%20small%20wind%20market%20size%20was%20estimated,a%20CAGR%20of%204.3%25%20from%202025%20to%202030.\">valued at $1.6 billion in 2024</a>, the global small wind turbine market is expected to grow over the next five years, reaching $2.2 billion by 2030.</p><h3>What Is Small Wind?</h3><p>Wind energy systems that are not utility-scale wind farms, generating large amounts of electricity that feed into the electrical grid, are generally known as “small wind.” Sometimes categorized as small wind turbines (SWTs) or distributed wind, it represents an adaptable and flexible option for generating renewable electricity by converting wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from rotor blades.</p><p>There isn’t a universally defined energy-generation capacity for small wind across all countries. In India, for example, small wind describes wind turbines with blades less than or equal to 200 square meters that generally have a maximum power rating of 50 kilowatts (kW). As the technology becomes more familiar worldwide, some SWTs now include higher-capacity models, ranging from 50 kW to 100 kW.</p><p>In the United States, however, small wind turbines are typically up to 100 kW in size to account for the advancement in wind technologies. It’s also often described as “distributed wind” to emphasize that the power these turbines produce is consumed in the same place as it is produced.</p><p>Ultimately, small wind differs from large utility-scale wind turbines in terms of size, capacity, and operational complexity, while also being considerably easier to install and operate. This makes it a great option for geographies with high wind potential, space constraints, limited or unreliable grid infrastructure, or high electricity costs from diesel or imported fuels.</p><h3>Where Is Small Wind Most Valuable?</h3><p>Communities are increasingly turning to small wind to produce their own energy, especially where grid reliability, rising electricity costs or supply disruptions are a concern. The technology is most common in rural or remote areas, where it not only powers homes but also supports farming tasks like pumping water or grinding grain.</p><p>While small wind is not always suitable, there are a few noteworthy contexts in which it may play a pivotal role in diversifying energy sources and helping communities achieve greater energy independence.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26029765/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Agricultural and Rural Communities</h4><p>Agricultural and rural communities have had a lot of success with small wind due to the relatively small physical footprint of the turbine technology. Small wind energy systems have often proved to be an efficient use of space for the amount of electricity it can generate. One <a href=\"https://latinocoalitionofsanbenitocounty.co/\">community organization in San Benito County, California</a> is currently exploring ways to work with local zoning and land-use officials to allow for the deployment of small wind turbines on agricultural land. Along with an agrivoltaics project, which simultaneously uses land for agriculture and solar power, and a workforce development program, the organization’s proposal will help educate other community members and strengthen both the economic and grid resilience in the region.</p><p>In communities where it’s already legal for distributed wind installations, agricultural and industrial property owners can successfully offset their high energy usage and minimize disruptions to operations during power outages. An<a href=\"https://foundationwindpower.com/p-budlight-fairfield.html\"> Anheuser-Busch brewery in California</a>, which has a hybrid wind and solar system, and a <a href=\"https://www.cooperative.com/programs-services/bts/radwind/Documents/RADWIND-Case-Study-CCPPD-July-2021.pdf\">2.5 MW wind system on a farm in Nebraska</a>, is already proving this success. Turbines in both locations are offsetting electricity demand to ensure the electricity used is both cleaner and cheaper than the general grid mix.</p><p>As small wind gains traction on farms and industrial facilities, even more rural communities have begun seeing it as an opportunity to gain control over their energy production. Communities like Ford County, Kansas, <a href=\"https://fordcountygis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/sidebar/index.html?appid=27c3565ff7714d0cbd1c7ca4a1b41b31\">have built at least seven utility-scale wind projects</a> in the last few decades that is transports electricity through nearby transmission lines to power other communities. But now, Ford County is modifying their zoning codes to include small wind and exploring municipal procurement so they too can utilize their exceptional wind resource and support energy independence for local farmers, businesses and residents.</p><h4>Remote Communities</h4><p>Remote communities are also looking to small wind for energy independence and freedom from unstable energy costs. Due to their heavy reliance on diesel generators and long-distance power lines, many communities in Alaska are exploring small wind as a solution. After installation, wind power has very low operating costs and can be cheaper than importing fuel. Highly successful projects, like the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/winds-st-marys-alaska\">Winds of St. Mary’s</a> in Alaska or Maine’s <a href=\"https://www.foxislandswind.com/\">Fox Islands</a>, have inspired other remote communities to engage technical experts and explore the potential of small wind in lowering steep energy costs.      </p><p>Around the Horn of Africa, small wind systems have become the most viable solution in the scarcely electrified parts of those countries. South Africa has more than 100,000 small wind turbines directly coupled with water pumps in operation across 46,000 farms.  A <a href=\"https://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/MSc_2011/Allardyce.pdf\">study</a> from the UK suggested a 6 kW turbine is able to supply approximately 7.1% of the current electricity demand of a primary school in Isle of Arran, UK.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People with camels pass by wind turbines in the desert.  \" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-11/wind-power-desert-india_0.jpg?VersionId=pR4IaSNWf8isb_caiDMk8qXzc1xSa88Z&itok=zcDS9CzH\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Small wind can bring power to remote areas like this desert in Rajasthan, India, on the border with Pakistan. Photo by Donyanedomam/iStock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Climate-Conscious Communities</h4><p>Climate-conscious communities, which are seeking solutions to minimize their reliance on fossil fuels and meet clean energy goals like <a href=\"http://www.bcrcvt.org/regional-plan.html\">Bennington County in Vermont</a>, are also actively putting rules in place to reduce <a href=\"https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/66654.pdf\">soft costs</a> — or any non-hardware costs of distributed wind deployment — and other barriers to small wind deployment. By following the lead of previous examples, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cooperative.com/programs-services/bts/radwind/Documents/RADWIND-Case-Study-San-Isabel-Nov-2021.pdf\">Huerfano River Wind Farm</a> in San Isabel, Colo., these communities are pursuing multiple goals: helping residents control energy costs, enhancing local quality of life and supporting local climate ambitions.</p><h3>What are the Barriers and Opportunities for Small Wind Projects?</h3><p>Just as momentum is starting to build and the industry has begun to see some success, small wind is facing some challenges. Issues like limited resource mapping studies, maintenance issues, lack of standardization and quality control, limited awareness and business models, challenges in testing and certifications have hindered its growth.</p><p>In the U.S., for example, federal support has wavered since the beginning of the Trump administration and the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-republican-budget-bill-will-hurt-us-economy\">recent elimination of federal tax credits</a> that will severely impact the economic viability of new turbines and hybrid systems.</p><p>The industry does not have many workers trained in small wind installations and service, thus making new installations and servicing challenging, particularly in rural areas or new markets. And even where there is a strong enough wind resource and an installer willing to make the trek to build the turbine, the local permitting processes might be restrictive. All of these factors add to the final cost and limit the economic viability of small wind turbines.</p><p>In other countries, like India, higher capital costs compared to alternatives have found to be a challenge as policies and incentives have shifted toward solar energy.</p><p>Small wind in India typically costs between 80,000 rupees to 1 million rupees ($906 to $1,133) per kilowatt, whereas a 1 kW solar rooftop system costs around 40,000 rupees to 70,000 rupees ($453 to $793). This cost disparity is primarily due to the lack of economies of scale in manufacturing, expensive materials like rare earth magnets and the technical complexities involved in turbine production, installation and maintenance. The cessation of subsidies after 2017 further raised their effective price, making them less competitive compared to rapidly declining solar photovoltaic costs.</p><p>Yet with lower operating voltages, compatibility with hybrid systems and suitability for community- or household-level use, small wind still can be promising for rural and off-grid situations where localized, safe and easy-to-maintain solutions are critical.</p><p>To help counter some of these barriers, local government officials can pull a range of levers to encourage more growth of small wind projects. Staff might install a wind turbine on municipal property, work together with local utilities to reduce barriers to interconnection, or develop educational resources for residents seeking clean energy opportunities. An increasingly common action that governments might take is to streamline their permitting processes for small wind. Reducing the soft costs associated with the deployment of small wind turbines can lead to increased interest in the technology from local installers, residents, and other stakeholders.</p><p>Local government staff can also review zoning code and existing permitting processes to identify potential barriers to wind development, highlight areas for improvement, educate relevant staff on best practices, and, most importantly, communicate with local stakeholders to understand the community’s level of support for future small wind deployment. With robust public input, local governments can build a strong foundation for future small wind development in their community.</p><h3>Unlocking Small Wind’s Potential</h3><p>Small wind turbines may not be the perfect solution for every scenario, but there are many instances where they can play a role in scaling up deployment of renewable energy.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\">Scaling-Up Small Wind Turbines in India</p><p class=\"secondary\">To unlock the full potential of small wind projects, WRI India <a href=\"https://wri-india.org/research/scaling-small-wind-turbines-india-barriers-and-options-way-forward\">produced a study</a> that highlights the need for better resource mapping; collaboration; support and interest from policymakers; technical improvements and standardization; and more. </p></div><p>These systems have brought reliable power, supported livelihoods and built local workforce capacity. As a standalone unit or as part of hybrid systems, small wind offers a flexible, decentralized solution, especially in areas where land is limited or there are issues preventing large renewable installations. Small wind can also increase energy access to more people around the world and provide greater ownership over energy production at the same time.</p><p> </p><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the value of the global wind turbine market and the high-capacity value range of small wind turbines.

But finance cannot stop there.</p><p>The High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG) <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Raising-ambition-and-accelerating-delivery-of-climate-finance_Third-IHLEG-report.pdf\">estimates</a> developing countries (excluding China) need to spend $2.7 trillion annually by 2030 to meet climate and nature-related goals. $1.4 trillion of this would come from domestic sources and $1.3 trillion from abroad.</p><p>$1.3 trillion is therefore a more accurate reflection of developing countries' needs by 2035, and so the more important target. But of course, it is the much larger hill to climb. Important, too, is understanding how and where funds are likely to flow.</p><h3>Is $300 Billion Achievable?</h3><p>In short, yes. Though <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/implementing-the-presidents-executive-order-on-reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/\">current political headwinds</a> make it more difficult, achieving the goal remains possible.</p><p>In 2022, the latest data available, developed countries delivered around $116 billion to developing countries for climate action. This exceeded the previous climate finance goal of $100 billion annually, which the NCQG replaces. We reviewed the sources of this finance, looking at how funding trends are likely to grow over the next decade, and found that $300 billion by 2035 is very much in reach.</p><p>How this money is raised, though, could have implications for the type of finance made available and who can access it most easily.</p><h3>Where Would the Money Come From?</h3><p>We can generally assume that similar types of finance will be counted toward the $300 billion goal as were counted toward the $100 billion goal. This would include bilateral finance (country to country), multilateral finance (such as from multilateral development banks (MDBs) and multilateral climate funds), and private finance mobilized by public funds. Under the NCQG, there's also a possibility to count \"alternative sources\" of climate finance, such as international taxes or rechanneled <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/special-drawing-right\">IMF \"special drawing rights\"</a> (a type of international reserve asset).</p><p>Moving beyond $300 billion, toward $1.3 trillion, will require much more private investment in climate action than we've seen to date in addition to increases from the sources above.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21507234/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Public multilateral finance is the biggest source</h4><p>Public multilateral finance involves public funds going from one country to another through a multilateral entity, like a development bank. This category represents the highest share of international climate finance so far — <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-in-2013-2022_19150727-en.html\">$51 billion</a> of the $116 billion delivered in 2022 — and will likely continue to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Multilateral development banks</strong></em></p><p>MDBs like the World Bank provide a significant portion of international climate finance, and there are <a href=\"https://www.dt.mef.gov.it/en/news/2022/news_caf.html#:~:text=CAFs%20play%20a%20crucial%20role,phase%20and%20future%20crisis%20scenarios.\">many ideas</a> on the table for how to further supercharge their efforts.</p><p>At COP29, <a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bedea9b0aeb98d9ca20d9140a208b9e1-0020012024/original/Joint-MDB-Statement-for-COP29.pdf\">MDBs committed</a> to providing $120 billion in climate finance to low- and middle-income countries by 2030; roughly double what they provided in 2022. Part of this growth is likely intended to come from an increase in the percentage of their funding going to climate action. And part will come from continued growth in total MDB finance, largely as a result of <a href=\"https://coebank.org/documents/1577/G20_Roadmap_towards_better_bigger_and_more_effective_MDBs.pdf\">reforms to free up capital</a>.</p><p>Additional growth is possible — especially if countries pay in more capital, increasing the base amount against which MDBs can lend. While such increases may be unlikely today with current political dynamics, they could feasibly happen before 2035. The IHLEG <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Raising-ambition-and-accelerating-delivery-of-climate-finance_Third-IHLEG-report.pdf\">estimates</a> that $60 billion in capital increases over a ten-year period could bring MDB climate and nature-related finance up to around $240 billion per year. This figure refers to growth across the entire MDB system, encompassing a range of banks and funds with varied shareholder structures.</p><p>Some of the increase in MDB climate finance will also come from a change in the way their contributions are counted. Under the $100 billion goal, only 70% of MDB's total climate finance was included in the tally. This is because not all countries channeling climate finance through MDBs were considered contributors to the goal. But any country can voluntarily contribute to the $300 billion — meaning potentially all climate finance flowing from MDBs to low- and middle-income countries could be counted.</p><p>If MDBs meet their 2030 target of $120 billion, this would comprise 40% of the $300 billion goal. This is around the same percentage the MDBs provided toward the $100 billion goal in 2022 (41%). If they could reach $240 billion, per the IHLEG's estimate, this would cover 80%.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Women holding umbrellas carry children down a flooded street.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-02/flooding-sylhet-bangladesh.jpg?VersionId=FdBoq6unh5JSjQTnWsYLYx4JKG2W13CG&h=854a7be2&itok=vX5MkZ7h\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>People navigate heavily flooded streets in Sylhet, Bangladesh in June 2024.

There are a variety of ways they can do this, such as offering guarantees or insurance on climate projects to lower risks and attract private investors.</p><p>The $65 billion assumes that MDBs can leverage <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/11/12/multilateral-development-banks-to-boost-climate-finance\">54 cents in private finance</a> for every $1 they spend (a mobilization ratio of 1:0.54) and meet their $120 billion goal. For comparison, they mobilized 38 cents per dollar spent in 2023 (a 1:0.38 ratio).</p><p>If MDBs deliver $240 billion in climate finance by 2030, they could mobilize as much as $91-$130 billion annually in private funds (reflecting a 1:0.38 and 1:0.54 ratio, respectively).</p><p><em><strong>Multilateral climate funds</strong></em></p><p>Multilateral climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund, are specifically dedicated to providing climate finance in developing nations and are financed primarily through governments pledges. Historically they've made up a very small proportion of international climate finance: just $3.4 billion (3%) in 2022, down from $4.2 billion in 2021.</p><p>Despite their modest size, the climate funds are valued by many for allowing <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/improving-access-green-climate-fund-how-fund-can-better-support-developing-country\">direct access</a> to developing country institutions. They also provide a higher rate of grants and highly concessional financing (loans with more favorable terms) than other sources. Between 2016 and 2022, 54% of finance from the climate funds came in the form of grants, compared to 39% of bilateral finance and 9% for the MDBs.</p><p>At the 2024 UN climate summit (COP29), countries agreed to at least triple the amount these funds disburse by 2030. This would require wealthy countries to significantly increase their contributions. If tripled, the funds would provide around $10 billion annually by 2030, or less than 4% of the $300 billion, with additional growth possible by 2035.</p><h4>Public bilateral finance has grown, but faces political headwinds</h4><p>Bilateral finance involves public funds directed from one country to another. In 2022, bilateral finance accounted for $41 billion (35%) of the $116 billion provided and mobilized.</p><p>The amount of bilateral finance needed will hinge on what other sources deliver:</p><ul><li>If MDBs reach their stated target of $120 billion and mobilize $65 billion in private finance, and if the multilateral climate funds cover $10 billion, this leaves a gap of $105 billion for bilateral institutions to fill.</li><li>If MDB finance instead reaches the higher estimate of $240 billion, at current private sector mobilization rates, we could exceed the $300 billion target without any bilateral funds.</li></ul><p>Bilateral climate finance doubled between 2013 and 2022, from $22.5 billion to $41 billion. If another doubling occurs by 2035, as called for by the IHLEG, bilateral finance would reach around $80 billion. But there's no guarantee of this: With strong <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/24/g-s1-44643/trump-foreign-aid-assistance-pause\">political headwinds</a> against international climate and development finance in many developed nations, significant growth in bilateral finance may be challenging — though the ten-year window leaves room for political cycles to turn.</p><p>Economic growth can help increase overseas development assistance to a degree, especially in countries like <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2021/03/development-co-operation-tips-tools-insights-practices_d307b396/hitting-the-0-7-oda-gni-target-while-protecting-funding-commitments_647ce483.html\">Denmark</a>, where it is tied to gross national income (GNI). If we assume increases in bilateral finances of just 2% to follow an estimated 2% annual growth in GNI, it will reach a relatively modest $53 billion by 2035. It is also possible that some developing nations will increase and voluntarily report finance as part of the efforts to reach $300 billion.</p><p><em><strong>Private finance mobilized by bilateral public finance</strong></em></p><p>In 2022, developed countries reported that they mobilized $9.2 billion in private finance for climate action in developing countries. With bilateral finance reaching $41 billion that year, this implies a mobilization ratio of 22 cents per dollar spent.</p><p>Unlike the MDBs, countries have not stated a new target for mobilized private finance. If we assume bilateral finance reaches $53 billion in 2035 (a 2% annual growth rate), the same rate of mobilization as in 2022 would result in $11.7 billion by 2035. If bilateral finance were to double to $80 billion by 2035, the same mobilization rate could leverage $17.6 billion in private finance.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A woman charges an electric motorbike at a solar-powered charging station in a parking lot.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-02/kigali-electric-motorbike-charging.jpg?VersionId=gM5M0V_pCYl_FEWfqEKZXWXkj8Q8hBXY&itok=pauXSUR_\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Solar-powered chargers for electric motorbikes in Kigali, Rwanda. Climate finance supports green projects that can help developing countries improve lives and sustainably grow their economies. Photo by IMF Photo/Kim Haughton/Flickr</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Alternative sources can now be counted, too</h4><p>In addition to multilateral and bilateral finance, the NCQG recognizes \"alternative sources\" — such as international taxes or solidarity levies — as a potential option for raising finance toward the $300 billion goal.</p><p>Some experts have suggested a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/staff-climate-notes/Issues/2024/10/01/Destination-Net-Zero-The-Urgent-Need-for-a-Global-Carbon-Tax-on-Aviation-and-Shipping-555090\">tax on international flights,</a> applied to airlines based on greenhouse gas emissions, or <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/billionaire-wealth-tax-progress-made-at-the-g20-must-continue-by-gabriel-zucman-2024-08\">wealth taxes</a> as ways to raise finance for climate action. These measures are attractive in part because they could introduce entirely new funding streams. The IMF estimates that a carbon tax on international transportation emissions could bring in up to $200 billion per year, which could then in theory be disbursed as international climate finance.</p><p>Another option is rechanneling the IMF's special drawing rights, which are a type of international reserve. In 2022, nations with larger economies <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bolstering-climate-finance-through-special-drawing-rights-by-jayati-ghosh-2023-12\">agreed to reallocate</a> special drawing rights to developing countries. So far, this has resulted in <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/Resilience-and-Sustainability-Trust\">around $40 billion</a> in finance being distributed through the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which mainly helps low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries tackle climate risks. Countries have also agreed to re-channel special drawing rights through MDBs and use them as hybrid capital. Moving forward, countries could agree to reallocate additional special drawing rights and modernize the framework to allow for more regular issuances — though governments currently appear <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/why-central-banks-might-not-want-recycle-sdrs-and-why-they-are-wrong\">reluctant</a> to take this step.</p><p>High integrity, well-managed carbon markets also channel funds for developing nations' climate action, in theory. But the idea of counting these investments toward the NCQG is highly controversial, since any emissions reductions are claimed by the buyer (meaning they don't count toward the developing country's own climate goals). Governments have agreed that the Adaptation Fund (one of the climate funds) will receive a 5% share of proceeds under the Paris Agreement's international carbon crediting mechanism. But it remains to be seen whether this will count toward the $300 billion goal.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21508449/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>How Will Finance Be Delivered?</h3><p>The NCQG is not just about the amount of finance developing countries receive, but also the type.</p><p>How finance is delivered matters immensely. Many of the poorest countries are already struggling with <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/debt-climate-action-developing-countries\">unsustainably high debt levels</a> and cannot afford to take on new, high-interest-rate loans, even for climate projects which can aid their growth and reduce risks. They may require a higher proportion of grants or highly concessional funding — meaning loans with, for example, low interest rates and/or longer repayment periods. (This can be useful in the context of a more systematic approach to debt restructuring and relief.) In other countries, and in sectors where an economic or financial return is expected, loans and private finance can be a more appropriate investment type.</p><p>While the NCQG noted that grant-based and highly concessional finance is particularly important \"for adaptation and responding to loss and damage in developing countries,\" it fell short of setting concrete targets for this.</p><p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html\">around</a> 39% of bilateral and 9% of multilateral climate finance came in the form of grants, which mainly went to low-income countries. Between 2016 and 2022 these countries received 64% of their climate finance in grants, compared to around 12% for middle-income countries.</p><p>Going forward, even maintaining the current percentage of climate finance that is provided as grants or highly concessional finance will require concerted effort. Much of the growth in MDB finance, for example, is likely to come from reforms and capital increases that tend to boost lending to middle-income countries, not grants to low-income countries.</p><p>Similarly, if a larger portion of the $300 billion comes from mobilized private finance — as predicted by the MDBs — this will tend to flow through private loans or equity investments, not grants or highly concessional finance.</p><h3>Who Will Receive the Funds?</h3><p>International climate finance is meant exclusively for developing countries, but this is a broad and diverse group of nations. Who exactly will receive finance, and how much, was not laid out in the NCQG — though the final text did recognize that small island developing states and least developed countries are particularly in need of assistance, especially for adaptation and loss and damage.</p><p>In 2022, lower-middle income countries received 46.5% of reported climate finance, upper middle-income countries received 34.5%, and low-income countries received just 11.1%. A small number of high-income countries received 3.4% of the financing, and 20.4% of the funds were not allocated by income group. (Some developing countries classified as high-income may receive investments because they are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as small island states like Antigua and Barbuda and Barbados.)</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21596160/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Although climate finance approximately doubled between 2016 and 2022, its distribution across these income groups has stayed relatively constant. But major shifts in funding sources could potentially upend precedent. For example, if the growth in MDB finance is largely through non-concessional loans, this will tend to favor middle income rather than low-income countries. The same is true of mobilized private finance if it ends up playing a larger role. Only 3% of mobilized private finance counted in 2022 went to low-income countries.</p><p>Ultimately, the overall percentage of finance received is less important than how favorable the rates and terms are — or the share of finance on \"grant equivalent\" terms (meaning the amount that would have been provided if the finance was a grant, before taxes or other charges). Middle income countries will likely continue to receive the most finance overall, given the size and relative strength of their economies and the larger ticket sizes of low carbon investments there. What is important is that the lowest income and most vulnerable countries receive a good share of the grant and highly concessional finance, especially for adaptation and loss and damage.</p><h3>How Do We Move from $300 Billion to $1.3 Trillion — the Real Target?</h3><p>While $300 billion should be within reach, the real challenge will be how to scale up finance \"from all public and private sources to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035\" — the truer measure of what developing countries need.</p><p>Clearly, meeting the $1.3 trillion target will be a steep climb. Funding will need to come from the same sources listed above, as well as private financial flows not mobilized by public funds. The latest <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Raising-ambition-and-accelerating-delivery-of-climate-finance_Third-IHLEG-report.pdf\">IHLEG report</a> suggests that around half of the $1.3 trillion, or $650 billion, will come from cross-border private finance and the other half from international public funds.</p><p>Raising that amount of public funding will require much more ambition from wealthy nations and significant capital increases at the MDBs. In addition, countries will likely need to forge new international actions and agreements to leverage \"alternative\" sources of finance like international taxes, with a significant proportion of the funds dedicated to climate action in developing nations.</p><p>Growing private finance will also be a challenging — but vital — feat. While current data on cross-border climate investment in developing countries is limited, and estimates vary, $650 billion is almost certainly a massive leap from the present.

Governments wanting to attract private sector investment need to set ambitious targets and transition plans, enhance investment environments, and work together with the private sector to develop investment opportunities and shift risk perceptions. From the financier side, it will be important to drive forward measures such as scaling up and replicating effective risk sharing and credit enhancement mechanisms, tapping into long term institutional investment, and increasing the role of national development banks and local currency.</p><p>\"<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\">Country platforms</a>\" which bring public, private, domestic and international finance together behind green transition plans and policies, can play a role in mobilizing private finance and ensuring an efficient capital stack.</p><h3>How Will Progress Be Measured?</h3><p>Countries have decided to adopt the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/FAQ-moving-towards-the-ETF\">enhanced transparency framework</a> under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the transparency system for the new finance goal. Through this system, countries will report on the finance they provide and receive and what it's used for. In addition, the UNFCCC's Standing Committee on Finance will prepare a \"collective progress\" report biennially to reflect on progress to date, drawing on a variety of sources.</p><p>But questions remain; particularly around how the $1.3 trillion target will be monitored, as it covers an array of funding sources that will not be reported through the UNFCCC system. Additional reporting and review of this — particularly in fora such as the G20, where Finance Ministers and Financial Institutions are present — will be important.</p><h3>Charting a Path Forward</h3><p>The NCQG represents an important — possibly transformative — step toward a safer and more sustainable future. But this hinges on how it's executed.</p><p>$300 billion is within arm's reach, as long as MDBs continue along their reform path and countries maintain their contributions. The important remaining question is how to ensure that the right funds are matched to resource needs and finance reaches those who need it most.</p><p>But where countries should truly be setting their sights is the full $1.3 trillion. This should be a guiding star as we head toward 2035, as it's not only the better measure of need, but also the true ambition the climate crisis demands.</p><p>While we have until 2035 to reach the finance targets agreed in Baku, the work must begin now. </p><p>Several international summits this year helped build momentum around the new goal:</p><ul><li>At the <strong>Finance in Common Summit</strong> in February, public development banks <a href=\"https://financeincommon.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/FiCS%202025%20Final%20Communique%CC%81.pdf\">recognized the critical role</a> they play in operationalizing the NCQG.</li><li>In June, many leaders from governments, development finance institutions, civil society organizations and elsewhere gathered at the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/4-ways-financing-development-can-deliver-people-nature-and-climate\"><strong>International Conference for Finance for Development</strong></a>, held once a decade. Here, these players recommitted to bolstering finance for sustainable development, emphasizing the need for collaboration to mobilize climate finance at scale.</li><li>At the <strong>BRICS summit</strong> in July, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa united behind <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brics-countries-rally-around-assertive-climate-agenda-ahead-cop30\">calls for strengthened climate finance</a>, including scaling up finance for climate adaptation.</li></ul><p>Two more critical opportunities still remain to make headway in 2025:</p><ul><li>At the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub\"><strong>2025 UN climate summit (COP30)</strong></a> in November, the Baku-to-Belém roadmap will provide a foundation for discussions on the $1.3 trillion target. At COP30, attendees could help build confidence that this roadmap is achievable by announcing new efforts to mobilize finance at scale, such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\">country platforms</a>, finance commitments from the private sector and progress toward establishing solidarity levies.</li><li>Leaders at the<strong> G20 summit</strong>, held immediately after COP30, could use this opportunity to lay out how to overcome economic hurdles faced by developing nations, including unsustainable debt and high costs of capital, that put the brakes on climate investments.</li></ul><p>Leaders should capitalize on this momentum and use their time at COP30 and the G20 to chart a path forward, overcome headwinds, and ultimately deliver the finance the world needs to confront the climate crisis.</p><p><em>Editor's note: This article was originally published in February 2025. It was updated in November 2025 to reflect developments from recent high-level discussions and the release of the Baku-to-Belém roadmap.</em></p>",

      "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>BRUSSELS (November 5, 2025)</strong> - Today, the EU Council </span><a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/11/05/2040-climate-target-council-agrees-its-position-on-a-90-emissions-reduction/\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">reaffirmed the bloc’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\">, compared to 1990 levels. While this underscores Europe’s long-term ambition, up to 5% of the reductions are expected to come from carbon offsets outside the EU, with an agreement to periodically review the plan.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The EU ministers also confirmed the European Commission’s earlier “statement of intent” for the 2035 nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions by 66.25–72.5% from 1990 levels. The NDC will be a key input into the COP30 climate summit in Brazil next week.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, World Resources Institute:  </strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The EU’s 90% target reflects the level of ambition this moment demands and stands out as one of the most ambitious commitments in the world. Finalizing it just ahead of COP30 shows that the bloc is determined to arrive at the summit with a serious contribution to tackling the climate crisis, and signals that it recognizes climate action as central to Europe's economic future.”</span> <br /> <br /><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Europe’s climate competitiveness and energy independence will not be secured through hesitation or outsourcing. Keeping the door open to revising climate measures creates uncertainty for businesses that need long-term investment security. The announcement to revise and postpone the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS-2), while leaving open the possibility of additional offsets, adds to this unpredictability. The exact way these provisions will be applied will determine the EU's actual speed of transition.”</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The EU’s 2035 target is a solid step toward reaching its longer-term climate goals, but only if the bloc strives for the highest end of its target.  </span><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/assessing-2025-ndcs\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">WRI analysis</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\"> shows the EU must cut emissions by 72.5% to stay on track for 1.5°C. It would also allow for a smoother emissions reduction towards the 90% goal, rather than relying on steeps cuts after 2035. Falling short would create an unmanageable gap and would undermine investor confidence in Europe’s long-term transition.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“By phasing out fossil fuels and investing in clean energy and innovation, the EU can cut energy dependence and build a more resilient domestic economy in an increasingly volatile world. Any use of carbon credits requires strong guardrails to ensure they meet robust social and environmental standards, are fully transparent, and truly deliver additional emission cuts.  </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The EU must come to COP30 ready to deliver — with the tools, commitments, and measures needed to turn ambition into action and push other countries to advance ambitious plans as well.”</span> </p>",

      "description": "<p><em>New commitments at the COP30 Local Leaders Forum aim to bridge local and national climate strategies and boost implementation</em></p><p><strong>RIO DE JANEIRO (November 5, 2025) </strong>— The COP30 Local Leaders Forum in Rio de Janeiro, held ahead of this year's UN climate conference in Belém, concluded today with national and subnational leaders making bold new commitments to strengthen city- and state-level climate action while advancing the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/coalition-high-ambition-multilevel-partnerships-champ-climate-action\">Coalition for High Ambition Multi-Level Partnerships</a> (CHAMP), a group of 77 countries committed to greater multilevel cooperation in developing national climate plans.  </p><p>Cities are responsible for 70% of global energy-related CO2 emissions and over 60% of global energy use. Bold urban climate action can sharply cut emissions while simultaneously driving economic growth, creating jobs and improving quality of life. Yet, despite long-standing recognition of their importance, subnational climate strategies have often remained disconnected from national climate plans.  </p><p>At the COP30 Local Leaders Forum, World Resources Institute (WRI), Bloomberg Philanthropies and Brazil’s Ministry of Cities convened more than a dozen ministers, mayors and governors from CHAMP countries — which together represent 65% of global GDP and 37% of emissions — to share lessons learned and accelerate implementation. The resulting commitments aim to close the gap between local initiatives and national strategies, by institutionalizing support across all levels of governance.</p><p>Michael R. Bloomberg, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions and Founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.org/press/michael-r-bloomberg-launches-next-era-of-local-leadership-to-formalize-role-of-cities-states-and-regions-in-global-climate-action/\">announced a $168-million commitment</a> from Bloomberg Philanthropies to usher in the next era of local climate leadership and multilevel collaboration.  </p><p>“Mayors and governors are showing the world that cities and states can lead the way when it comes to fighting climate change,” said <strong>Bloomberg</strong>. “This investment will unlock new opportunities for leaders — in Brazil and around the world — as they partner with national governments, scale data-driven, proven solutions that cut emissions, and build a stronger and healthier world.”</p><p>Through this support, WRI will deepen its role in CHAMP, strengthening governance structures, expanding in-country partnerships and helping cities, states and regions deliver impact at scale.</p><p>“Local leaders are frontrunners in delivering solutions that both cut emissions and improve lives today,” said <strong>Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO of World Resources Institute</strong>. “When cities work hand in hand with regional and national governments — as we’re seeing in Brazil and around the world — their impact multiplies. By building on what works, we can turn local progress into lasting change that powers a more just, thriving and sustainable global economy.”</p><p>In Brazil, WRI Brasil will partner with C40 Cities, the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the National Front of Mayors (FNP), and government, multilateral and private sector partners, to help make the country a global model of climate federalism, supported by robust finance mechanisms to unlock mitigation and adaptation projects at the local level.  </p><p>Building on these efforts, Bloomberg Philanthropies, in partnership with the Mitigation Action Facility, WRI Brasil, Brazil's Ministry of Cities, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, and BTG Pactual, announced the creation of a 80-million-euro ($93-million) E-Bus Credit Enhancement Fund for Brazil, expected to unlock financing for more than 1,700 electric buses.</p><p>“Almost 90% of public transport in Brazil relies on city buses,” said <strong>Luis Antonio Lindau, Director of WRI Brasil Ross Center for Sustainable Cities</strong>. “Transitioning them to electric models is essential to improving quality of life for millions of citizens and helping the country get on track toward net-zero by 2050. As countries and financial institutions move from commitments to action, blended finance mechanisms like this credit enhancement fund are key to making electric mobility a reality.”</p><p>To date, CHAMP countries have submitted 50% of all new national climate commitments, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), ahead of COP30, part of a broader wave of national-local collaboration reshaping the global climate process. COP28 in Dubai and COP29 in Baku both had more formal roles for mayors and governors, and COP30's Urban Ministerial on Urbanization and Climate Change will serve as a central platform to advance enhanced NDCs, improved finance flows, affordable and resilient housing, and inclusive economic transformation.</p><p>“Climate action works best when it starts locally, where it touches people’s daily lives,” said<strong> Rogier van den Berg, Global Director for WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities</strong>. “When cities and national governments align, they can deliver real change — for people, for nature and for the climate. Innovative local approaches can drive national policy and inspire solutions around the world.”</p><p>In the year ahead, WRI will continue helping governments convert climate commitments into action, mobilize financing and strengthen local leadership — turning local solutions into global impact.</p><p><em><strong>About World Resources Institute  </strong> </em><br /><em>WRI works to improve people’s lives, protect and restore nature and stabilize the climate.

      "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>BELÉM (November 5, 2025)</strong> —Today, the COP presidencies of Azerbaijan and Brazil published </span><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/650953\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">the Baku to Belém Roadmap</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\"> to $1.3T. This report represents a key output agreed to at COP29, detailing how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Baku to Belém Roadmap presents numerous options for increasing investment in climate to reach this scale. Delivering on this will be critical for COP30’s focus on moving from commitments to action.    </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Following is a statement from Melanie Robinson, Global Director of Climate, Economics and Finance at World Resources Institute: </strong></span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The Baku to Belém Roadmap turns a promise made at COP29 into a plan. It charts a smart, holistic strategy to deliver $1.3 trillion a year in climate finance for developing countries, and start transforming the global economy, starting now.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The roadmap’s value is in its combination of pragmatism with a focus on scale and systems change. For too long, the climate community has been overly focused on relatively modest sums of public climate funding, whereas the Baku to Belém plan rightly shifts the lens to how a wider set of public finance and policy shifts can unlock much larger flows from private investors. </span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“As Brazil and Azerbaijan rightly note, tackling the climate crisis means rewiring the financial system so that all actors pull in the same direction, from development banks and private capital providers to public policy makers and financial regulators. Thanks to input from the Circle of Finance Ministers, the roadmap is grounded in tackling the real-world challenges that finance ministers and other financial actors face. As the economic case grows ever clearer, this is exactly what’s needed to drive large-scale investment in clean energy, resilient agriculture and adaptation — creating jobs, strengthening economies and reducing risk.</span> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“With this roadmap in hand, COP30 must pivot from plans on paper to investment at scale. Success in Belém will depend on whether all sources of finance can work together to align behind country-led priorities, and whether scarce grants go where they are needed most. The roadmap shows how to reach $1.3 trillion — now the world must deliver.”</span> </p><p> </p>",
