      "description": "<p><strong>BRUSSELS (July 7, 2025) -</strong> Today, the European Commission presented its formal proposal to cut the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, from 1990 levels.</p><p>The revised EU Climate Law aligns with the lower limit of the 90%-95% reduction range recommended by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change in 2024. The 2040 target will be a critical input to the EU’s forthcoming national climate plan, or Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).</p><p><strong>Following is a statement by Stientje van Veldhoven, Vice President and Regional Director for Europe, World Resources Institute: </strong></p><p>“A 90% emissions cut by 2040, as proposed by the Commission, keeps the EU on track for climate neutrality. It’s realistic, absolutely necessary and aligned with the bloc’s earlier commitment. If achieved, the EU will be well on its way to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.</p><p>The EU must back this credible 2040 target with a timely NDC by September with at least a 72.5% economy-wide emission reduction by 2035. This would set a clear, ambitious path for the green transition and show the EU is serious about leading the global energy race, investing in its industrial competitiveness and strengthening its energy security. </p><p>The proposed emission reductions must be delivered through domestic action. Overreliance on carbon credits would undermine the credibility of the EU’s target while diverting investment away from the EU’s clean tech industry. It is critical that monitoring and verification guardrails are put in place to limit the use of carbon credits to less than 3% of the target, ensure transparency and prevent emissions leakage. </p><p>The Commission also proposes leveraging carbon removal, which should be approached cautiously. While carbon removal can play a role in reaching the EU’s target, this must complement — not replace — deep emissions cuts. First and foremost, EU policymakers must take bold steps to phase out fossil fuels, scale up renewables, electrify transport and halt deforestation. Europe’s credible climate leadership will be vital as we approach COP30 in November.”</p><p> </p>",

      "description": "<p>Istanbul's Caferağa neighborhood has a longstanding reputation for its cultural richness and historic charm. Quaint cafes, restaurants and bars line the sidewalks. A thriving arts scene draws an eclectic crowd. More than 2.3 million visitors daily flock to the district in which Caferağa resides — but it's overwhelming the neighborhood's small community of 22,000 residents.</p><p>\"The streets of Caferağa are struggling to bear the weight they carry,\" said Hanife Dağıstanlı, the neighborhood chief. \"The sidewalks are too narrow and often blocked, and people are forced to step into the road just to keep moving.\" This overcrowding has made it hard for locals to navigate daily life, especially those who are older, have disabilities or are traveling with children or strollers. At the same time, heavy traffic contributes to Istanbul's worsening air pollution and discourages people from using cleaner travel options, like biking.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People on a narrow sidewalk crowded with pared cars and chairs.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/caferaga-crowded-sidewalks_0.jpg?VersionId=LK_PHsRUkedjDm7RFZAW7_6w9mqov4mv&itok=nXOsaDEA\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Caferağa's sidewalks overflow with parked cars, bikes, scooters and furniture, making it difficult for residents to get around.

Popular cities around the world are seeking ways to balance the economic boon of tourism with residents' needs and sustainability goals. Some (like Venice) now charge day-trippers an access fee to visit popular areas. Others (like Paris and Barcelona) are placing tighter restrictions on short-term rentals to curb tourism.</p><p>But Caferağa wanted to address its overcrowding differently: By collectively reimagining the neighborhood to be cleaner, safer and more livable for all.</p><h3>In Caferağa, Urban Challenges Collide</h3><p>While Caferağa is far from the only urban hub facing crowded sidewalks, polluted air and gridlocked streets, it makes a strong case study for better urban design.</p><p>The neighborhood is shaped like a peninsula, funneling travelers through just two main entry points and concentrating traffic along a narrow street network. It is also home to about twice as many older residents per capita as the national average, making safe and accessible mobility a high priority.</p><p>Meanwhile, residents in and around Caferağa are increasingly grappling with the dangers of extreme heat and air pollution as the planet warms. Istanbul's summer heat waves are <a href=\"https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/76-mln-face-extreme-heats-this-summer-in-turkiye-study-200745#:~:text=The%20megacity%20of%20Istanbul%20was%20affected%20by%20the%20high%20temperatures%20originating%20from%20climate%20change%20for%2047%20days%2C%20while%20the%20capital%20Ankara%20experienced%20such%20temperatures%20for%2041%20days\">already worsening</a> and could become <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/europe-cities-extreme-heat-climate-change#:~:text=Istanbul%20may%20experience%2040%25%20more,could%20go%20up%20by%2044%25.\">much more severe</a> in the years ahead.

Caferağa was recently designated as one of three pilot Low Emission Zones in Istanbul under the city's Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, which aims to address congestion, air quality issues and mobility challenges. Major cities like Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Rome have seen success using similar low-emissions-zone strategies to curb emissions and improve mobility. Due to its higher population of older adults, the Kadıköy district (which houses Caferağa) was also included in Istanbul's Street Transformation Program, which supports sustainable, people-friendly urban design.</p><p>But designating a neighborhood as a priority for transformation doesn't mean the work is done. On the contrary: It's only a starting point.</p><h3>Creating a Livable City from the Ground Up</h3><p>It started with a single square block. In September 2023, Caferağa temporarily transformed Mehmet Ayvalıtaş Square at the center of the neighborhood — a small but ambitious pilot project.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About WRI Türkiye's Deep Dive Initiative</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">The Livable Caferağa project is part of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/deep-dive-cities\">WRI's Deep Dive Cities Initiative</a>, which fosters long-term engagement with city officials and residents to build more sustainable, resilient urban environments. The next phase of the project will expand to the entire Kadıköy district and include nature-based solutions for urban heat island mitigation. We aim to develop a comprehensive concept plan, complete with pilot applications, for integrating nature-based solutions into urban mobility projects in Kadıköy. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/creating-more-sustainable-and-livable-caferaga\">Learn more about the project here</a>.</p></div><p>By temporarily restricting vehicles and using water-based paint and modular street furniture, pedestrians reclaimed the adjacent square. New benches and greenery created places to rest. Colorful crosswalks near the primary school improved safety and visibility. The usually vehicle-dominated space became, almost overnight, a vibrant gathering place for locals and visitors alike.</p><p>While temporary, the redesign caught residents' attention and helped catalyze months of collaboration to reimagine Caferağa's streets. Through discussions with the local government as well as researchers, NGOs and WRI Türkiye's Deep Dive Cities team, the community landed on five core recommendations to improve quality of life and tackle sustainability issues simultaneously. All five are currently moving forward with the municipality at various stages of implementation.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"768\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"768\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Aerial view of Mehmet Ayvalitas Square in Istanbul.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/mehmet-ayvalitas-square_0.jpg?VersionId=hbGQpdfsxmF0rylU5Db1U6gT25.oUYAx&itok=4Dn_RJqE\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Mehmet Ayvalıtaş Square after the temporary redesign.

The vibrant space stood in contrast to their typical experience navigating Caferağa's narrow sidewalks — which, according to Emel Budak, an older resident, are so overrun with cafe tables and haphazardly parked scooters that \"it is almost impossible for elderly or disabled individuals to pass through.\"</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-right half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1013\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"800\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A worker with three potted trees. \" height=\"607\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/potted-trees_0.jpg?VersionId=gJU.WEPpgvnMjVSCfF.W0beKIyIebk_X&itok=wZWEGUAM\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Trees brought in for the temporary square redesign. Photo by </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The pilot project highlighted the need for designated pedestrian zones throughout the neighborhood. Residents recommended wider sidewalks, accessible ramps, and raised, visible crosswalks to make the district safer — especially for people with disabilities. </p><p>Meanwhile, planting trees along major pedestrian routes would help improve air quality and cool the streets on hot days. Installing benches would create places to rest and socialize. And residents raised the need for tactile (textured) paving at places like crosswalks and curb edges to make it easier for those who are visually impaired to get around.</p><p>Collectively, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/complete-streets-brazil-promoting-paradigm-shift\">these solutions</a> can significantly improve walkability, comfort and safety. As the city begins to roll the changes out, residents will be able to provide continuous feedback through the municipality's <a href=\"https://impetus4cs.eu/accessible-kadikoy/\">Accessible Kadıköy</a> platform, which may help inform future improvements.</p><h4>2) Making room for bikes and scooters</h4><p>Caferağa's size makes it well suited for cycling or scootering, which can help cut down on vehicle traffic. But the neighborhood lacks a connected network of lanes. Parking is also an issue: Dağıstanlı told us that she receives countless complaints from residents about bikes and scooters blocking already crowded sidewalks.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"E-scooters in a designated street parking zone.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/20230927-111802-1.jpg?VersionId=POFd1keg4RaqgLBkkhep4nOGd7XwPSSV&itok=My8-0MLY\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Ride-share scooters in a designated parking area. Photo by WRI Türkiye</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In response, Kadıköy Municipality plans to grow its network of bike lanes from 18 km to 58 km by 2050, while developing an e-bike sharing system and designated bike parking. </p><p>Alongside addressing residents' concerns around safety and accessibility, this will support the district's broader <a href=\"https://makingcity.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240609-factsheet-Kadikoy_compressed.pdf\">sustainability efforts.</a> With Kadıköy aiming for a <a href=\"https://iklim.kadikoy.bel.tr/Uploads/iklim.kadikoy.bel.tr/202105271202061.pdf\">40% reduction in GHG emissions</a> by 2030 and full climate neutrality by 2050, infrastructure for electric and zero-carbon transportation is essential.</p><h4>3) Creating a new local shuttle system</h4><p>Caferağa is conveniently located near major transit hubs. However, it doesn't have its own transportation system. This makes it difficult for people — especially caregivers and older residents — to navigate the neighborhood and access public transit like the metro system and ferry, which link Caferağa to the rest of the city.</p><p>Residents and the WRI Türkiye team proposed a new shuttle service for the neighborhood, called ModaBüs, to make local trips easier and provide connections to nearby transit centers. Kadıköy Municipality is now in the final planning stages, having worked closely with community members to identify 17 stop locations and assess proposed routes that will connect residential pockets with public spaces and transit points.</p><p>Set to launch in late 2025, ModaBüs will integrate with the wider public transport system — including metro, tram and ferry lines — providing first- and last-mile connectivity for the over 22,000 residents of Caferağa. It will operate free of charge for those with 65+ cards, disability cards, mother cards (which enable mothers to ride transport for free) and local residency documentation.</p><h4>4) Developing a thoughtful approach to parking</h4><p>With overcrowding at the core of Caferağa's challenges, it's not surprising that parking (or the lack thereof) emerged as a key issue. But rather than adding more parking — which residents recognized would only hike congestion and pollution — the community suggested sustainable management strategies. These include limiting on-street parking in commercial areas, installing digital systems for more effective regulation and enforcement, and prioritizing parking for residents.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-left half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1013\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"800\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"607\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"People in a park looking at a display table.\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-07/community-involvement_0.jpg?VersionId=uycIB8lyq35gXYQGdQb8n4O9oObN7_Dv&itok=afHH4wrc\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>An interactive display for community members in Mehmet Ayvalıtaş Square. Photo by WRI Türkiye</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Nuran Kansu, an older neighborhood resident who often struggles to find parking during special events like football matches, suggested that \"transforming nearby schoolyards or other suitable open spaces into temporary parking areas during such occasions would provide significant relief for residents.\" The community is also considering visitor parking fees to generate revenue that could support needed infrastructure upgrades and enforcement.</p><p>These proposals are still in the planning phase. Once approved, they will build on measures from Istanbul's Low Emission Zone strategy. Caferağa is also limiting the number of non-resident vehicles that can pass through the area, especially during peak hours on evenings and weekends.</p><h4>5) Optimizing local deliveries</h4><p>Over 600 motorized delivery vehicles make their way around Caferağa each day, sustaining the community's tourism and service industries. But during peak hours, trucks and couriers often stop in narrow streets and block sidewalks. Loud late-night and early-morning deliveries disturb residents.</p><p>Scheduling deliveries during off-peak hours, designating specific loading zones and strengthening enforcement would improve quality of life in the neighborhood. It would also make a meaningful dent in carbon emissions: WRI estimates that transitioning even 30% of Caferağa's deliveries to electric or active transport (like bike couriers) could eliminate approximately 425 kg of CO2 emissions per week — roughly equivalent to eliminating 1,000 miles driven in a gas-powered car.</p><p>Taking inspiration from cities like <a href=\"https://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-cargo-bike-action-plan-2023-acc.pdf\">London</a> — where shifting to cargo bikes has reduced both <a href=\"https://www.westminster.ac.uk/news/using-cargo-bikes-for-deliveries-cuts-congestion-and-pollution-in-cities-study-finds\">delivery times and emissions</a> — the community, including nearly 70% of local businesses, has expressed support for a comprehensive cargo bike delivery strategy for Caferağa. A pilot program is set to begin later in 2025.</p><h3>Setting an Example Other Cities Can Follow</h3><p>The changes proposed in Caferağa are not solely about infrastructure; they are about enhancing the quality of life for all residents.</p><p>These new strategies — and Caferağa's process to develop them — offer insights for other urban areas facing similar challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Community involvement is key.</strong> Participatory and inclusive planning processes are essential to developing successful solutions. By helping local stakeholders and residents to understand the challenges, and working closely with them to identify solutions, Caferağa arrived at a framework that truly meets community needs. Through regular neighborhood meetings and via the district's digital feedback platforms, residents will continue to shape and refine the improvements to their neighborhood.</li><li><strong>Testing out solutions and responding to feedback creates stronger buy-in.</strong> The pilot project implemented in Mehmet Ayvalıtaş Square invited community interaction and real-time feedback — and showed people what is possible through better street design. This effort catalyzed strong engagement from the beginning and added nuance to the final series of recommendations.</li><li><strong>The most successful solutions address multiple challenges at once.</strong> Working to address mobility needs, accessibility challenges and sustainability together can be more efficient and responsive to a community's needs. For example, adding shade trees and greenery along sidewalks and cycle lanes simultaneously reduces urban heat, encourages walking and biking, and fosters a sense of community among residents. Comprehensive efforts to calm traffic will make the neighborhood safer, more navigable and ultimately more sustainable. </li></ul><p>Caferağa is one of Istanbul's most unique and dynamic areas. But its struggles with overcrowding and pollution will only worsen if left alone. The neighborhood's collaborative, iterative approach to addressing these challenges could set it on a better and more sustainable path — and inspire other neighborhoods to do the same. Now it's time to bring this shared vision for a Livable Caferağa to life.</p>",

The Sumerians, inventors of writing, the wheel and the first cities, built legendary settlements like <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1481/\">Ur, Uruk and Eridu</a> on the fertile fringes of these marshes.</p><p>Today, the <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/marsh/\">Marsh Arabs (Ma'dan)</a>, using ancient traditions, depend on the water, crafting floating reed houses and raising the water buffalo for food and income. Their way of life, adapted to the wetlands, tells a story of resilience that spans millennia.</p><p>However, intensifying use of water resources is placing greater strain on the Ahwar. Water stress — the ongoing competition over water — increases water pollution and threatens the ecological integrity, biodiversity and cultural significance of the Ahwar.</p><p>According to data from WRI’s Aqueduct platform, the Ahwar marshes face extremely high water stress, where over 80% of the renewable supply is withdrawn to meet human demand.

It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1989 for its vital ecosystem and essential source of livelihood for tens of thousands of people. Despite its reputation for massive cascading water, Mosi-oa-Tunya/Victoria Falls has faced recurring drought over the past decade and at times dried up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/victoria-falls-dries-to-a-trickle-after-worst-drought-in-a-century\">barely a trickle</a>. </p><p>Fed by floodwaters from the Zambezi River, Mosi-oa-Tunya/ Victoria Falls is crucial to the planet for several reasons.</p><p>Economically, Mosi-oa-Tunya/ Victoria Falls drives the tourism industry in both Zambia and Zimbabwe, drawing over 1 million visitors a year under normal conditions. Local tour guides, lodge owners, craft sellers and conservationists rely heavily on the flow of visitors. The water flowing from the falls also feed hydroelectric plants downstream that supply power to millions across southern Africa.</p><p>Ecologically, its riverine “rainforest” nurtures a rich diversity of wildlife and plants, including <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/509/\">endangered and migratory birds</a> like the Taita falcon.

That means in a drought year, it takes longer for relief to arrive; and the <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/drought-definition/\">longer a drought continues</a>, the more it affects the people, crops and economy around it.</p><p>In 2019, more than <a href=\"https://savetheelephants.org/news/drought-ignites-human-wildlife-conflict-zimbabwe/\">300 people in Zimbabwe were attacked by animals</a> in search of food and water; <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/corrected-victoria-falls-shrink-to-a-trickle-feeding-climate-change-fears-idUSKBN1YA1I4/\">45 million people</a> in southern Africa were in need of food aid amid crop failures; and in Zimbabwe and Zambia, hydroelectric power shutdowns caused <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146068/water-levels-keep-falling-at-lake-kariba\">blackouts up to 18 hours a day</a> — affecting millions while posing significant challenges to development and climate adaption goals.</p><p>An Aqueduct analysis found that Mosi-oa-Tunya/ Victoria Falls ranks as a medium drought risk, below the more than 430 UNESCO World Heritage Sites that rank as a high drought risk. This is primarily because relatively low population density and limited human development immediately surrounding the site reduces overall exposure. However, the site faces increasing pressure from tourism-related infrastructure development and data shows the probability of drought occurrence ranks high — a finding reinforced by the many recent droughts that have plagued the region.  </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3175848/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Climate change is not only expected to make these droughts more frequent, but<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23021\"> recovery is expected to last longer</a>, especially in places that <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/us-drought-vulnerability-rankings-are-how-does-your-state-compare\">aren’t prepared</a>.  The time between droughts may not be long enough for the ecosystem to recover — which is particularly concerning for Mosi-oa-Tunya/ Victoria Falls.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Water gushes over Victoria Falls.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/victoria-falls-healthy_0.jpg?VersionId=5x.kIvV0C.71hGzCt8VwszuWocT8_VR7&h=57957440&itok=CPehaKqA\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Gushing water from Victoria Falls drives tourism and nurtures a rich diversity of wildlife and plants.

The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986 and simultaneously placed on the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/\">List of World Heritage in Danger</a>, due to its overall vulnerability to natural erosion and extreme climatic events associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"An aerial view of the Chan Chan Arch\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/chan-chan-aerial-view_0.jpg?VersionId=to0onWsrmQV.DsLS0bmpcUyUqL89eQDC&h=40fe288c&itok=wZ6YFCqw\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>The Chan Chan Archaeological Zone in Peru is the largest adobe ruins in the world.

Stretches of farmland once surrounded Chan Chan, supported by a sophisticated irrigation system that diverted water from the Moche and Chicama rivers. These advanced water management systems not only <a href=\"https://www.peru-explorer.com/the-fascinating-history-of-chan-chan-perus-ancient-city.htm\">sustained the Chimú with water</a> during times of drought, but <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/1000-year-old-wall-in-peru-was-built-to-protect-against-el-nino-floods-research-suggests\">may have also protected the city from El Niño flooding</a>. </p><p>But the1,000-year-old adobe walls of Chan Chan were not built to withstand the intensified El Niño flooding of the 21st century. </p><p>The El Niño climate pattern warms the ocean and upends wind patterns, especially in the Pacific. In Peru, the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/coasts4030026\">warmer sea temperatures transform</a> the normally dry winds into humid air that gathers in the foothills of the Andes. When fully saturated, this tropical atmosphere can release up to <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/heavy-summer-rains-flood-peru\">10 times more rain than usual</a>. Mountain rivers swell, hurtling toward the coast as torrents of water, mud and rock. Known locally as <a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-a-huayco.html\">huaycos</a>, these destructive mudslides sweep away everything in their path, from homes and roads to hospitals and schools.</p><p>Chan Chan is no exception. According to WRI’s Aqueduct platform, the UNESCO site and its surrounding region in La Libertad face extremely high risk to river flooding, a threat that is only expected to grow and is shared by more than 390 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list. By 2050, the population affected by floods each year in an average, non- El Niño year in La Libertad is expected to double from 16,000 to 34,000 due to a combination of human activity and climate change. In an El Niño year, that increase may be much higher.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3175910/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Modern agriculture has dramatically expanded around Chan Chan. All that irrigation has <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/canopy/chanchan/\">pushed up the groundwater level</a>, leaving less room in the soil to absorb rainfall during storms.

Hundreds of people were killed, thousands were displaced — some <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/peru-faces-surge-climate-migrants-0\">permanently</a> — and millions of residents were affected. From space, the scars of swollen rivers and devastating huaycos are visible near Chan Chan. On the ground, caretakers report that the site's delicate adobe structures are deteriorating from heavy rainfall and erosion.</p><p>Chan Chan has weathered centuries of time, wind and desert sun.

Large-scale development and encroaching coastal flooding are squeezing the wetlands to death.</p><p>For decades, land reclamation — converting sea areas into land by filling in marshes for agriculture, industry or urban development — led to the loss of extensive mudflat habitats. In 2018, China responded by <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/3063544d79677a6333566d54/share_p.html\">banning land reclamation</a> in Bohai Bay, a move widely praised by conservation groups.</p><p>But another challenge is harder to control: coastal flooding, which is currently impacting close to 50 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list.

Even without storms, tidal conditions have temporarily <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202410/1321664.shtml\">raised sea levels by up to 1 meter</a> (3.2 feet) in some areas, flooding the nearby cities.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed\"><noscript><img alt=\"visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3175924/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>As the sea pushes inland, it leaves less exposed mudflats where birds can find food — especially where protective infrastructures like seawalls and levees prevent wetlands from naturally shifting further inland.

The 2018 ban on land reclamation was a major step forward, and local restoration projects are beginning to show positive results. In <a href=\"https://en.people.cn/n3/2024/0920/c90000-20221304.html\">Nandagang Industrial Park</a>, for example, coastal development was halted in 2015 to allow wetland restoration.

      "description": "<p>European forests are constantly changing as they experience the impacts of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/europe-forest-loss-drivers\">climate change and intensive harvesting</a>. In Nordic regions, the area of tall trees — which store the most carbon — <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/european-tall-forest-decline\">is declining</a> as harvesting overtakes regrowth. In southern Europe, severe forest fires are decimating large areas during ever-hotter summers. In central Europe, insect outbreaks are increasing in production forests, and demand for biomass energy continues to increase.</p><p>Understanding where, why and how much forests are changing is crucial for the long-term health of Europe's forests and supporting ongoing policy discussions for improved forest management, as well as ensuring a sustainable bioeconomy — forests in the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Forests,_forestry_and_logging\">are estimated to generate</a> €174 per hectare through the forestry and logging industry, and almost half a million people are employed in the industry.</p><p>There are different ways to monitor European forests: Historically, abundant and detailed ground data has been the main source of information, but a wealth of satellite data has been developed over the last few decades and has become increasingly important.</p><p>For example, the proposed <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/forest-monitoring_en\">EU Forest Monitoring Law</a>, which aims to provide consistent monitoring of Europe's forests, is built on a combination of both ground and satellite data, and in early 2025, 78 scientists from 17 European countries <a href=\"https://forwards-project.eu/open-letter-advocates-for-the-full-consideration-of-earth-observation-in-the-eu-forest-monitoring-law/\">signed a public letter</a> describing the benefits of satellite data for EU forest monitoring needs. Many European initiatives, including the <a href=\"https://forest-fire.emergency.copernicus.eu/\">European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS)</a>, also rely on satellite data. </p><p>While there are many satellite data sets that give insights on European forests, including data with global coverage on WRI’s <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch platform</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">annual tree height data</a> for Europe from the University of Maryland, these do not provide targeted, comprehensive monitoring tools for the region.</p><p>Now, <a href=\"https://landandcarbon.projects.earthengine.app/view/european-forests\">a new European Forest App</a>, developed by researchers from WRI and Land & Carbon Lab in collaboration with GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and building on the <a href=\"https://www.forestnavigator.eu/\">Forest Navigator Data Cube</a>, supports better monitoring of European forests by providing tailored information and insights in an easy-to-use platform. This new tool demonstrates the value and availability of free and open satellite data for European forest monitoring needs.</p><h3>About the New European Forest App</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://landandcarbon.projects.earthengine.app/view/european-forests\">European Forest App</a> provides harmonized and accessible data derived from multiple sources that are useful for European forest monitoring needs. It includes 12 indicators for forest change and condition: tree cover loss, gain, height, extent and stable forest extent (all based on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">data from the University of Maryland</a>); and forest age, fragmentation state and change, long term disturbance, biomass, forest type and forest management, long term disturbance, and biomass. </p><h4>European Forest App indicator details</h4><table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th width=\"120\"> </th><th width=\"120\">Indicator</th><th width=\"138\">Source and input data</th><th width=\"223\">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"5\" style=\"background-color: #fff;\" width=\"120\"><strong>Tree and forest characteristics</strong></td><td width=\"120\">Forest type</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/high-resolution-layer-forest-type/forest-type-2018\">Copernicus 2018</a>, based on 100-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Area (ha) of broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest areas in 2018</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Tree area</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">Turubanova et al. 2023</a>, based on 30-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Area of tree cover (ha) in six periods with 5-year intervals between 2001 and 2021</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Tree height</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">Turubanova et al. 2023</a>, based on 30-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Mean tree height for 2001 and 2020 in areas of trees >= 5 meters</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Forest age</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/4881/2021/\">Besnard et al. 2021</a>, based on 1-kilometer data</td><td width=\"223\">Area of forest (ha) in specified age classes (e.g. <10 years, or between 50 and 100 years) for 2010</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Biomass</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722000311\">Araza et al. 2022</a>, based on 100-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Woody aboveground biomass (Mg/ha) in 2020</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\" width=\"120\"><strong>Forest change</strong></td><td width=\"120\">Tree cover loss</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">Turubanova et al. 2023</a>, based on 30-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Area (ha) of tree cover lost in 5- and 10-year periods between 2001 and 2021</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Tree cover gain</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">Turubanova et al. 2023</a>, based on 30-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Area (ha) of tree cover gained in 5- and 10-year periods between 2001 and 2021</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Stable tree cover extent</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">Turubanova et al. 2023</a>, based on 30-meter data</td><td width=\"223\">Area (ha) of tree cover which remained stable in 5- and 10-year periods between 2001 and 2021</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Disturbance</td><td width=\"138\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00609-y\">Senf and Seidl 2021</a>, based on 30-meter data</p><p> </p></td><td width=\"223\"><p>Area of forest disturbance (ha) per year from 1986 to 2020</p><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #fff;\" width=\"120\"><strong>State of forests</strong></td><td width=\"120\">Forest fragmentation</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39221-x\">Ma et al. 2023</a>, metrics based on 30-meter data, with fragmentation calculated on a 5000-meter grid</td><td width=\"223\">Area (ha) of forest in five different fragmentation classes in 2000 and 2020, and mean change in fragmentation from 2000-2020</td></tr><tr><td width=\"120\">Forest management</td><td width=\"138\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01332-3\">Lesiv et al. 2022</a>, based on 100-meter data</td><td width=\"223\"><p>Area of forest under different management classes in 2015</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Users can select indicators from a dropdown menu and click on the map to see statistics calculated by country, province/state and district/municipality administrative levels.

Ground Data for Monitoring European Forests? </h3><p>Many European countries have robust monitoring of their forests based on extensive ground data, so what is the benefit of using satellite data?</p><p>First, not all countries have up-to-date or detailed national data, so satellite data can bolster national monitoring efforts for these countries.</p><p>Additionally, while ground data is detailed and precise, and is essential for calibrating and validating satellite-derived estimates, satellite data is complementary and offers many benefits for monitoring European forests:</p><ul><li><strong>Globally consistent:</strong> Satellite data provides a large-scale comprehensive and common data source for all countries so that progress towards shared EU-wide goals can be tracked.</li><li><strong>Timely:</strong> Satellite data provides much more frequent updates than ground monitoring campaigns, which typically occur every five to 10 years.</li><li><strong>High quality:</strong> While no data is error-free, all the data on the European Forest App is based on peer-reviewed science and has open and transparent information on their quality, such as uncertainty measures, which can guide users in interpreting the information.</li><li><strong>Cost effective:</strong> Satellites can provide large amounts of data more cost effectively than other sources like airborne surveys or data collection in the field, which can be very costly. This makes it easier for companies and others to comply with regulations like the EU Deforestation Regulation.</li><li><strong>Open and free:</strong> Anyone anywhere can use the European Forest App for their own forest monitoring needs.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, no one data source can meet all data needs — for example, risk assessments under the <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en\">EU Deforestation Regulation</a> can benefit from both ground and satellite data — so having quality data of both kinds is important.</p><h3>How Does the European Forest App Differ from Global Forest Watch? </h3><p>For the past decade, WRI’s Global Forest Watch (GFW) platform has provided free, open-source, globally consistent data on the world’s forests. While GFW provides important data on European forests, the new app uses different data, including a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486#s0080\">Europe-specific data set</a> from the University of Maryland’s (UMD) GLAD lab that is not available on GFW. Unlike the global data on GFW, this data set is optimized for Europe.</p><p>In Europe, where many forests are actively managed and are replanted or allowed to regenerate after harvesting, the app provides additional data on gain, extent and stable forest area, which is particularly important.</p><p>For example, for the indicators based on UMD data from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003486\">Turubanova et al. 2023</a>, the app is able to provide data for all five-year and 10-year periods between 2001 and 2021 (e.g. 2001-2011, 2001-2006 and so on), whereas a similar global data set based on tree height also from UMD on GFW only provides the option to <a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-tools/new-gfw-tree-cover-gain-net-change-data/\">change the baseline year</a> for tree cover gain, and offers more limited options for extent (10 year intervals).</p><p>The app also includes other Europe-specific data types not available on GFW, such as forest age, that are relevant for discussions related to the EU Forest Monitoring Law and the <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/nature-and-biodiversity/nature-restoration-law_en\">EU Nature Restoration Law</a>. Additionally, the app provides some historical data as far back as 1986, where GFW provides data from 2000 onwards. In Europe, where harvest cycles are longer and growth is slower than in many parts of the tropics, this long timeframe can provide valuable insights into European forest dynamics.</p><p>However, GFW offers some important data not available on the app, such as annually updated data on tree cover loss, contextual data like biodiversity hotspots, and near-real-time deforestation alerts. GFW also provides dozens of widgets with data-derived statistics, additional Help Center support and compatible tools such as Forest Watcher that support users for specific use cases.</p><p>While there is overlap between the European Forest App and GFW, and major trends revealed by the data remain the same, the data will not completely align in all cases — different data and methods will lead to slightly different results. Users monitoring European forests should consult both sources to identify which better suits their needs: those interested in only European forest information over longer timeframes may prefer the European Forest App, and those interested in other information, such as near-real-time disturbances, may prefer the GFW platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://landandcarbon.projects.earthengine.app/view/european-forests\">Explore the European Forest App here</a>.

      "description": "<p>The path to accelerating progress on global goals for people, nature and the climate depends on bringing together different sources of finance to align efforts and work better as a system. It also requires agreement to tackle systemic challenges, such as high <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/cost-of-capital-observatory/tools-and-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">capital costs</a> and limited <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2005/06/basics.htm\" target=\"_blank\">fiscal space</a>. That’s exactly what this year’s <a href=\"https://financing.desa.un.org/ffd4\" target=\"_blank\">Financing for Development Conference (FFD4)</a> aims to deliver. It’s an opportunity to identify where more supportive, integrated frameworks could help countries more quickly <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/paying-for-paris\" target=\"_blank\">shift, align and increase</a> finance for sustainable development. </p><p>This opportunity comes amid a rocky global context. Poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation and rising fragility are not isolated crises — they are deeply interconnected and mutually reinforcing challenges that require an integrated response. Yet they are often addressed separately, resulting in unintended consequences and missed opportunities for sustainable solutions.</p><p>This gap is evident as we’re on track to achieve just <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2024/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">17% of the Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) — which include targets for people, nature and the climate — by their 2030 deadline. The progress report also shows that since 2015, progress on the climate action goal (SDG 13) has gone backward on 30% of its targets, while the remainder show only marginal improvement.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>The Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4)</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">The UN is organizing the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4) — taking place in Seville, Spain, from June 30 to July 3, 2025 — to take stock of the role finance plays in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. </p><p class=\"secondary\">Bringing together leaders from every UN member country and organization, along with many international financial institutions and private-sector actors, FFD4 is a key venue to integrate climate and development finance and goals, and to reduce fragmentation in the international finance system through reforms at both national and international levels.</p><p class=\"secondary\"> An outcome document known as the Compromiso de Sevilla  (the Seville Commitment), was endorsed by UN member countries ahead of the conference, with the U.S. exiting the process.</p></div><p>FFD4 also comes at a time when multilateralism is under strain, as evidenced by recent cuts to <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/official-development-assistance-oda.html#:~:text=ODA%20is%20financial%20support%20from,finance%20for%20least%2Ddeveloped%20countries.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://financing.desa.un.org/ffd4\">Official Development Assistance </a>(ODA) — finance provided by the governments to promote and specifically target the economic development and welfare of developing countries. ODA grew at an average annual rate of 7.6% from 2019 to 2023, but dropped 7.1% between 2023 and 2024, and may decline further amid shifting geopolitics, financial pressures in provider countries and a reprioritization of investments toward defense and other domestic priorities. Despite its past <a href=\"https://one.oecd.org/document/DCD%282025%296/en/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated resilience in response to crises</a>, recent cuts by some of the wealthiest countries, including the U.S. and the UK, have raised concerns about future levels of ODA.</p><p>Despite these headwinds, there are four key areas where multistakeholder approaches to financing sustainable and equitable development can be better coordinated — at FFD4 and beyond.  </p><h3>1. Integrate Climate and Nature into Development Planning</h3><p>Since the Earth Summit in 1992, financing for development and financing for climate and nature have largely evolved on separate tracks. But this parallel trend is reaching its limits. A central theme at FFD4 is the need to rethink sustainable development in light of new, compounding shifts in the global economy, climate and biosphere. </p><p>Addressing climate, nature and development goals together brings both the opportunity for economic growth — <a href=\"https://newclimateeconomy.net/content/press-release-bold-climate-action-could-deliver-us26-trillion-2030-finds-global-commission\" target=\"_blank\">up to $26 trillion from bold climate action by 2030</a> — and recognizes the imperative for development to be climate-resilient and nature-positive. Climate transitions must also be inclusive if they are to be sustained. </p><article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1200\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"960\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"735\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"579\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"347\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/png\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A timeline of development, climate and nature summits and their finance targets\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/25-6-23-ffd4-f1-v2.png?VersionId=NNossgrDvY_h_WBHtNgIsF1GuSn3y7ME&itok=xFhpVIVT\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The 2015 FFD in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, outlined the principles that this FFD must now turn into action, recommending concrete ways to incorporate climate and nature into development and economic decision-making. An <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2024/oct/green-and-just-planet\" target=\"_blank\">independent expert report to the G20</a> emphasized the need to integrate climate and nature into macroeconomic planning through a whole-of-economy, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. This would allow countries to weigh the choices and trade-offs involved in meeting climate, nature and people goals, and to drive forward structural reforms that shift economies onto a more sustainable path. </p><p>There is a range of tools that countries will need to make this possible. In addition to new macroeconomic models and multistakeholder consultations, <a href=\"https://www.wavespartnership.org/en/natural-capital-accounting\" target=\"_blank\">Wealth and Natural Capital Accounting</a> offers a way for decision-makers to incorporate climate and nature into their analytical toolkit. The <a href=\"https://www.wavespartnership.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WAVES</a> (Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services) partnership, coordinated by the World Bank, shows how governments are integrating natural capital accounting into macroeconomic planning, budget decisions and development policy in countries such as Colombia, Indonesia and Rwanda (WAVES core implementing partners). This approach to national accounting includes incorporating water resources, minerals, forests, biodiversity and tourism, helping shift decision making away from short-term GDP growth toward long-term sustainability.</p><p>International data-gathering frameworks offer another key opportunity for progress. Frameworks like the one underpinning the SDGs have helped governments adopt and monitor policies aligned with global targets. Many countries have already used these data to develop SDG action plans; now, innovative data-gathering methods can support <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/innovative-data-collection-methods-international-development\" target=\"_blank\">more targeted development policies</a>. </p><p>FFD4’s <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164591\" target=\"_blank\">Compromiso de Sevilla</a> underscores the need to support “high quality and disaggregated data and statistics [to] enable evidence-based policy decisions and enhance accountability and transparency, fostering public trust and international cooperation.”</p><p>But countries can’t do this alone. Data sharing and international cooperation are crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change and nature loss. To help finance flow to climate and nature, the Compromiso de Sevilla emphasizes the importance of “economic, financial, risk, and resilience data [to be made] available to all financial market actors, including through capacity building for developing countries.” </p><p>In implementing the Compromiso de Sevilla, a shared global vision for data cooperation on SDGs could unlock international investment and bridge capacity gaps. Ministers of finance, climate and environment can jointly lead this effort. </p><h3>2. Rewire Public Finance for Development, Climate and Nature</h3><p>There are several areas where countries broadly agree on the need for national action but require a coordinated approach, given the interconnected nature of the global economy. </p><h4>Coordinate subsidy reform</h4><p>It is widely recognized that countries — both developed and developing — should reform environmentally harmful subsidies, including those related to fossil fuels (<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/08/22/IMF-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Data-2023-Update-537281\" target=\"_blank\">$7 trillion in 2022</a>, 18% in “explicit” subsidies, where <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies#:~:text=Subsidies%20are%20decomposed%20into%20explicit,but%20these%20are%20relatively%20small.\" target=\"_blank\">fuels are sold below retail cost through government support</a>) and unsustainable agricultural practices (<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/farm-restoration-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\">$619 billion in 2021</a>). Ending these subsidies would help reduce environmental and atmospheric degradation; repurposing them could help reverse it. </p><p>But such shifts would have to be coordinated to ensure a <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-is-just-transition-tracking-progress\" target=\"_blank\">just transition</a> where no worker or country is left behind. Without coordination, any first mover is likely to face a competitive disadvantage. FFD4 should call on governments to lead in reforming subsidy frameworks and to work together to ensure a just and equitable transition. </p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\"><noscript><img alt=\"table visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23898835/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Align and unlock investment flows</h4><p>A holistic, country-level approach to financing, such as the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\" target=\"_blank\">concept of ‘country platforms’</a>, could help match appropriate finance to transition needs. Country platforms are a way for governments to <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/country-platforms-delivering-green-growth-scale\" target=\"_blank\">align public and private, national and international finance</a> at scale behind country-led plans and policy reforms to deliver climate, nature and development goals. </p><article class=\"media media--type-video media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-oembed-video field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">\n<div class=\"oembed-lazyload oembed-lazyload--youtube\">\n  <a class=\"oembed-lazyload__button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzB-RgwBZ80\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watch What are Country Platforms?\"><span class=\"oembed-lazyload__thumbnail\"></span></a>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>These platforms have the potential to address policy risks by aligning stakeholders around a shared vision and creating an enabling environment for attracting private finance. They recognize the centrality of capacity building and technical assistance in supporting countries — especially the poorest and most vulnerable — to take a systemic approach. They also allow for the <a href=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/2025-06/financing-country-platforms.pdf?VersionId=A3PpdLvOj9.oPO98HUtq2bSrU.9S2uzZ&_gl=1*vn0qba*_gcl_au*NDIwNTMyMjc3LjE3NTA4NjcwMTM.\" target=\"_blank\">most strategic use of scarce concessional and blended finance</a> by prioritizing structural reform and taking more programmatic approaches.</p><p>FFD4 calls to “support enhancing the ability of MDBs [multilateral development banks] and other PDBs [public development banks] to work better as a system, aligned with country-led development priorities and strategies”. It also calls on other development partners, financial institutions, relevant domestic actors, civil society and local governments to play their part in integrated approaches based on each actor’s comparative advantage. Countries are in the driver’s seat to initiate this convergence and advance country platform mechanisms.</p><h3>3. Activate Private Investments in the Real Economy</h3><p>Right now, mobilizing private investment aligned with people, nature and climate goals, and its potential to transform the real economy, is not happening fast enough or at sufficient scale. </p><p>Building on the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/publications/aaaa-outcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Addis Ababa declaration</a>, FFD4 aims to address the systemic issues that limit private sector investments in sustainable finance. The UN estimates developing countries face a <a href=\"https://desapublications.un.org/publications/financing-sustainable-development-report-2024\" target=\"_blank\">$4 trillion </a>investment gap to achieve the SDGs, particularly in sectors such as renewable energy and infrastructure, where the private sector plays a crucial role. </p><p>As stated in the Addis Ababa Accord, the private sector is a major driver of productivity, inclusive of economic growth and job creation; yet looking to private financiers to “fill in the gaps” has proven <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/05/15/the-chimera-of-private-finance-for-development\" target=\"_blank\">complex</a>. To date, there has been a strong focus on the use of blended finance to de-risk and thereby mobilize more private investment. This includes using concessional finance (from MDBs, for instance) or <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/philanthropy-adaptation-finance-developing-countries\" target=\"_blank\">philanthropic finance</a> to catalyze investments in nascent markets where risks are currently too high, or returns too low, for investors to step in alone. </p><p>Reforming <strong>risk-sharing instruments</strong> — such as guarantees, first-loss capital and hybrid instruments — and blended finance would help bring these approaches to scale. In the G20 process, MDBs have been encouraged to take more programmatic approaches (e.g., guaranteeing portfolios rather than single projects) and to streamline and harmonize internal processes, both among themselves and with other PDBs. They have also been encouraged to unlock more institutional investment through originate-to-share models and by supporting the development of sustainable asset classes. The Compromiso de Sevilla also proposes promoting the use of risk management, risk mitigation and risk transfer practices too. </p><p>However, mobilization of private finance also requires a stronger focus on changes in fiscal incentives, regulatory environments, enabling conditions and business models, as well as changes in demand. It is important to achieve cost-effectiveness, improve returns and reduce risks in this way, rather than rely solely on blended finance. In some cases, this can be done by using better data on returns or by <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\" target=\"_blank\">showcasing the dividends</a> that can come from investing in adaptation.</p><p>When it comes to investing in climate and nature, delivery has been inconsistent and difficult to track, especially in the case of private finance. The conference is likely to call for UN member states to implement proposals by adopting standards, tools and metrics as targets, and to publish performance indicators to better measure private sector mobilization rates, sustainable finance mechanisms and their impacts on people, nature and the climate (e.g., continuing the <a href=\"https://www.gemsriskdatabase.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GEMS</a> effort). </p><h4>4. Improve Global Cooperation on Debt</h4><p>As developing countries face increasing repayment burdens due to rising interest payments on debt, about <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/nations-where-3-3bn-live-spend-more-on-debt-than-health-schools\" target=\"_blank\">40% of the global population</a> lives in a country that spends more on debt servicing than on essential public services such as education and health.</p><p>The climate- and nature-relevant provisions of the Compromiso de Sevilla acknowledge the importance of accounting for climate and nature in debt frameworks and include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>A request for a UN-led working group (with the IMF and the World Bank) to propose voluntary principles for responsible sovereign borrowing and lending, “to strengthen debt management,” including:</strong><ul><li>Supporting more frequent use of state-contingent debt instruments, including climate-resilient debt clauses and debt pause clauses, which allow debt service suspension during climate or other external shocks. This would increase fiscal resilience.</li><li>Encouraging wider uptake of such clauses across both official and commercial lending, with international financial institutions supporting implementation.<br /> </li></ul></li><li><strong>Support scaling up debt swaps for the SDGs, especially those targeting climate and biodiversity outcomes, to “lower the cost of borrowing”:</strong><ul><li>Promotes concessional finance based on vulnerability to enhance debt sustainability and climate-resilient development.</li><li>Calls for simplifying debt swap processes, lowering transaction costs and ensuring country ownership.<br /> </li></ul></li><li><strong>Launch an intergovernmental UN-led process to close gaps in the international debt architecture and explore options to enhance sustainability, aiming to “restore countries to a path of debt sustainability and continue to work toward debt restructurings being timely, orderly, effective, fair, negotiated in good faith, predictable, and coordinated”</strong>:<ul><li>This includes dialogues with all stakeholders (UN Members, Paris Club, MDBs, IMF, World Bank and private creditors) to address debt challenges and climate-linked vulnerabilities.<br /> </li></ul></li><li><strong>Calls for reforming Debt Sustainability Assessments (DSAs) to “ensure that debt sustainability and credit assessments are accurate, objective and long term oriented”:</strong><ul><li>Calls for more accurate, long-term DSAs that integrate climate and nature spending needs, and account for investments in resilience, nature protection and productive capacity.</li><li>Account for multidimensional vulnerabilities and spillovers from monetary policy.</li><li>Encourages open consultation on DSA reformulation, capacity building and for countries to conduct their own assessments.</li></ul></li></ul><p><br />Multilateral initiatives to support countries at risk of, or already in, debt distress are mainly led by the World Bank, the IMF and forums such as G20. However, gaps and challenges remain across these initiatives, limiting comprehensive support that considers factors like climate vulnerability as an indicator for debt management and risk assessments. </p><table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\"><thead><tr><th>International Framework/<br />Taskforce<br /> </th><th>Actors</th><th>Scope</th><th>Drawbacks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Common Framework for Debt Treatment (G20)</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Low-income countries in debt distress. </td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Debt treatment (e.g., debt rescheduling, relief and write-off).</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">The process is currently lengthy, needs to be expedited to benefit more countries and expand private creditors' participation.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable </td><td>Creditors and beneficiaries.<br />Co-chaired by IMF, World Bank and G20 Presidency, includes official creditor members from the Paris Club, new creditors, private creditors and borrowing countries.  <br /> </td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Debt treatment (e.g., debt restructuring) for countries in default.</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Lack of clarity on options available to debtor countries throughout the debt treatment process, such as suspending debt service payments.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Debt Sustainability Framework (LIC DSF) (IMF/WB)</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Low-income countries with long-maturity concessional debt and countries eligible for the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) grants.</td><td>Assess borrower risk using threshold and benchmark indicators such as GDP, exports and revenue to inform lending decisions and determine debt limits based on borrower needs and repayment capability.</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Lack of debt data and inconsistent definitions may affect countries' risk assessments and ratings. <br />Lack of data on vulnerability.<br /> </td></tr></tbody></table><p>It is high time for a concrete breakthrough, one that takes a comprehensive approach to debt challenges and provides tailored solutions to free up fiscal space that countries need to invest in essential public services and resilient green growth. This should include measures addressing the drawbacks outlined in the table above.  </p><p>The World Bank Group and IMF have had climate strategies since 2021, yet integrating nature into their fundamental economic frameworks is still lagging. For example, FFD4 proposals are needed on how investments in resilience, nature protection and productive capacity can benefit economic activity and financial stability, including specific timelines for integrating these elements into national accounts. IMF and WBG are well positioned to lead the implementation of these proposals. </p><h4>Accelerating Sustainable Development Action</h4><p>A systemic, transformational approach is essential for addressing complex, transboundary environmental challenges like climate change and environmental degradation, and to achieve the SDGs. This requires more inclusive and effective global governance. FFD4 presents an opportunity to enhance global cooperation on these issues, ensuring policies and actions are harmonized across borders and effective in addressing them. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=400&nr=2051&menu=35\" target=\"_blank\">Addis Ababa Action Agenda</a> laid the groundwork for the SDGs and outlined a clear map for mobilizing finance to deliver them. Yet, with SDG progress currently off track, the task in Seville is to accelerate momentum by rebuilding trust and confidence in global cooperation. Political traction and impetus are urgently needed to implement complex domestic reforms, scale up international support to climate, nature and development, activate the private sector, address debt vulnerabilities and enable finance to work better as a system. </p><p>FFD4 could be a unifying moment that brings together the aspirations of the <a href=\"https://www.bridgetown-initiative.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgetown Initiative</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.afdb.org/sites/default/files/2023/09/08/the_african_leaders_nairobi_declaration_on_climate_change-rev-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Nairobi declaration</a>, the Paris <a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/en/emmanuel-macron/summit-on-a-new-global-financing-pact\" target=\"_blank\">New Global Financing Pact</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/summit-of-the-future/pact-for-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">Pact for the Future</a>, along with wider development and nature finance commitments, into an integrated action agenda. Keeping leaders accountable for delivering on the indivisible integrity of the SDGs is paramount.</p>",

India is by far the world's biggest producer and exporter of mentha oil, fulfilling <a href=\"https://www.mcxindia.com/docs/default-source/products/agro-commodities/performance-review/performance-review-2023-24---mentha-oil.pdf\">around 80%</a> of global demand. The bulk (70%) of this comes from Uttar Pradesh.</p><p>Yet what was once a stable cash crop is faltering. India's mint farmers now face stiff competition from synthetic menthol, coupled with rising production costs and high taxes. These challenges are only exacerbated by climate change, which is making harvests less reliable.</p><p>They aren't alone: Farmers and businesses around the globe are grappling with climate risks and market disruptions. But India's mint industry is also exploring solutions across the supply chain — from trade reforms to more climate-resilient crop varieties — that can offer lessons for resilience in a changing world.</p><h3>Mint: The 'Green Gold' of India's Smallholder Farmers</h3><p>Mentha farming has been a staple in Uttar Pradesh for over 40 years, particularly in the state's Barabanki region.

Once the harvest is dried, its essential oil is extracted in locally fabricated steam distillation units owned and operated by individual farmers or farmer collectives.</p><p>Farmers sell this mentha oil to aggregators in the village who further sell it to traders, exporters and small-scale and medium industries. The oil is either exported as-is or processed into menthol crystals and byproducts like Dementholized oil (DMO), alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and menthone.</p></div><h3>What's Ailing the Mint Industry?</h3><p>Traders, industrialists, scientists and farmers largely blame synthetic menthol for downturn in Barabanki's mint production.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media align-right half_content\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"571\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"451\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"600\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Clear crystals made from distilled mint oil.\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/mentha-crystals_0.jpg?VersionId=SIBnWsNkcXM5VJ3cO1HMHFS6e9IxsvOP&itok=GPpeMwFv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Menthol crystals derived from mentha oil.

When synthetic menthol — derived from <a href=\"https://www.betalabservices.com/natural-vs-synthetic-menthol/\">Meta-cresol, a petrochemical</a> — entered India around 2013, it offered an affordable alternative. \"Since then, many Indian companies making menthol-based products shifted to it\" said Tek Ram Sharma, a mint oil trader and chairman of essential oil company Ashri Naturals.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also included synthetic menthol in its list of substances <a href=\"https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/menthol/\">\"generally recognized as safe\"</a>. \"Since synthetic menthol is approved for use in edible products, companies would not want to spend more on natural menthol,\" said Mittal. This has pushed prices down and driven some farmers to abandon natural mentha altogether.</p><p>Synthetics aren't the only challenge. Mint faces high taxes in India. The national government charges a Goods and Services Tax of 12% on mint oil, and Uttar Pradesh charges a 1.5% Mandi tax (a tax on agricultural produce sold in markets) to mint oil traders.</p><p>In addition, many farmers rely on locally fabricated steam distillation units for producing mint oil.

Yet large companies tend to overlook these supply chain partners in their climate risk assessments and sustainability efforts. WRI, through the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-resilient-supply-chains-crest\">Climate-Resilient Employees for a Sustainable Tomorrow</a> (CREST) initiative, aims to create more resilient supply chains and help amplify the voices of the people within them. The Barabanki mint farmer is one of these voices. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/climate-resilient-supply-chains-crest/voices-supply-chains\">Explore more stories here</a>.</p></div><p>At one end, traders and local politicians are pushing to reform taxes and trade policies that hamper the natural mint industry. In <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsPotliEng/status/1819297177027653797\">August 2024</a>, a political representative from Barabanki worked with the Indian Parliament to separate natural and synthetic menthol in the country's trade code. This is meant to help ensure that potential issues with synthetics (such as defective products) will not impact the natural mint market.</p><p>Others are working from the ground up, helping farmers build resilience to climate and market shocks.</p><p>\"Mint is CIMAP's baby. It took hard work to turn India from a mint importing country to the biggest exporter in the world. So we will do everything to sustain natural menthol in the market,\" said Dr. Singh from CIMAP.</p><p>In 2017, CIMAP introduced early mint technology (EMT). This involves training farmers to produce mint stolons (stems) in a nursery and then transplant them onto ridges to ensure minimal plant loss and damage. EMT can lower the cost of production by reducing the need for weeding, irrigation and fertilizer. By cutting water use 25%-30%, it also helps reduce pressure on limited supplies. \"We found that the cost of cultivation with EMT has come down by 20% while crop yield has gone up by 15%,\" said Dr. Singh.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Small plot of mint plants.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-06/cimap-fields-1_0.jpg?VersionId=_.NAuegx0d7XU1gkd.GmmeMxwGBqj6dN&h=d1cb525d&itok=F_ro7hIf\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Experimental mint varieties developed by CIMAP have shown improved climate resilience and higher yields. Photo by Ravleen Kaur</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>CIMAP is also working to develop more resilient and productive mint varieties. In 2020, it developed and distributed \"CIM-Unnati\" — a hardy and high-yielding varietal that can better withstand extreme weather while yielding 180-190 kilograms of mint oil per hectare. (Other varietals produce 120-150 litres per hectare.) Almost 90% farmers in Barabanki now grow CIM-Unnati.</p><p>Chauhan — who runs a YouTube channel called \"Mentha's new variety\" — can attest to the benefits. \"In 2020, I got 700 grams of a new variety of Menthol mint from CIMAP and made 1,000 saplings out of it. I propagated these saplings [on 0.25 hectares] of my land and got a profit of Rs 1.5 lakh (US$1,740) by selling mint suckers,\" he said. Encouraged, Chauhan started the YouTube channel to promote his enterprise. \"Farmers from far and wide come to buy mentha suckers from me. This year, I rented 1.2 hectares of land to expand [production].\"</p><p>Beyond this, CIMAP is looking for ways to help stabilize mint farmers' livelihoods. It supports activities like vermi compost production from distillation waste; mushroom cultivation; and beekeeping. \"We are also exploring making disposable cutlery from mentha waste and aerosols from the water that comes out with oil at the time of distillation,\" said Dr. Singh. This is helping to diversify mint farmers income, boost their resilience and reduce dependency on one crop.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1183\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"946\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"725\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"571\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"342\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Woman holding a beeswax candle.\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/savitri-devi-beeswax-candl.jpeg?VersionId=nLD8JC3tjIJqoVZBgizLf.Mx8OyRTSpF&itok=6m7BquWM\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Savitri Devi, seen here holding a beeswax candle, is a member of the farmer group that CIMAP is supporting to help diversify their incomes. Photo by Ravleen Kaur</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Thanks to such initiatives, farmers like Chauhan are optimistic that mint prices will bounce back. And they are more securely positioned when climate extremes and other setbacks strike.</p><h3>The Way Ahead</h3><p>While large companies are increasingly focused on climate risks and sustainability, supply chain partners, such as smallholder farmers, tend to be left out of the equation. But this status quo can't continue. For truly resilient supply chains, stakeholders need to work together to ensure that everyone involved — from production through to sale — has the tools, skills and knowledge to weather climate and economic shocks.</p><p>This will require coordinated efforts from governments, research institutions and the private sector. Barabanki shows how collaboration and innovation can make a difference, with CIMAP supporting farmers directly while traders and local politicians push for market reforms. Looking ahead, more support from the government could offer new avenues for investment and improvement. For example, as Dr. Sudeep Tandon, CIMAP's Chief Scientist, points out, \"Menthol is one crop in which farmers themselves do the first level of processing. The government gives subsidies for other agricultural equipment and machinery; why can't there be a price support mechanism for menthol distillation units too?\"</p><p>Such efforts are critical for all who depend on India's mint supply chain. \"Mentha has prevented distress migration in [Barabanki] to a large extent,\" says farmer Ram Lagan Pal. \"[The] district's prosperity is only due to mentha.\" More support for resilience-building efforts can help ensure that this prosperity continues.</p><p><em>Ravleen Kaur is an independent journalist working on environmental and rural issues in India.

      "description": "<p><strong>BONN, GERMANY (June 26, 2025)</strong> — The 2025 UN climate talks concluded today in Bonn after a challenging start, with a two-day delay over the agenda cutting into negotiation time. As a mid-year checkpoint before COP30, the largely technical talks aimed to bring countries closer on core issues including adaptation, mitigation and finance. While some progress emerged, political tensions slowed momentum. <br /> <br /><strong>Following is a statement from David Waskow, Director, International Climate Initiative, World Resources Institute:</strong></p><p>“With four months to go before COP30, leaders need to start delivering: they need to put forward strong national plans to cut emissions and transform key sectors; scale up climate finance from all sources; and urgently implement and mainstream adaptation and resilience to protect lives, economies, and security. With the 1.5°C window closing fast, every fraction of a degree — and every decision — matters.</p><p>“Persistent political tensions and competing agendas led to limited and uneven progress in Bonn. Delegates did lay essential groundwork for better measuring adaptation — a key part for planning and accountability — and made some headway on just transition issues. What’s now needed is a strong dose of decisive, coordinated action to deliver real results.</p><p>“There can be no further delays in achieving the Global Stocktake priorities set in 2023 — from transitioning away from fossil fuels to tripling renewables, doubling energy efficiency and ending deforestation. Moving forward requires bold, system-wide change across every sector, driven by all levels of government, business, and civil society, recommitting to the Paris Agreement — together.”</p><p> </p>",

From April 2023 to July 2024, the Livable Caferağa project worked closely with residents to understand the neighborhood’s challenges around overcrowding, rising heat and pollution, and develop a set of responsive solutions.  </p><p>For several years, the WRI Türkiye Deep Dives team in Istanbul has worked closely with the city to advance neighborhood-scale active mobility planning. Istanbul is currently pursuing a citywide Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), which provides a broad framework for how the city can achieve a range of goals — from ensuring affordable, low-carbon public transport to encouraging a shift toward zero-carbon modes like walking and bicycling.</p><div class=\"callout alignright\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>Creating Sustainable Cities</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">Through its <strong>Deep Dives initiative</strong>, <strong>WRI Ross Center</strong> works in a deep and sustained way with a network of cities to develop both long-term relationships and solutions to entrenched urban challenges. </p><p class=\"secondary\"><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/deep-dive-cities\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the initiative</a>. </p></div><p>Within this strategy, Caferağa was selected as a priority area for developing a low-emission zone. As a key cultural and tourism hub in the city, the neighborhood faces increasing pressure from traffic and congestion. To support the SUMP’s implementation, WRI Türkiye focused its Deep Dive efforts on creating a plan that would balance Caferağa’s cultural vibrancy with the city’s goals of emissions reductions, sustainable mobility and livability.   </p><h3>Empowering Communities to Shape a More Livable Space</h3><p>Recognizing that Caferağa’s residents were bearing the consequences of overcrowding and pollution — including exposure to traffic fumes and limited mobility on crowded sidewalks, especially for older adults, people with disabilities and parents with young children — the Deep Dive project team put the community at the center of developing livable and sustainable solutions. Through a broad outreach and engagement campaign with residents, local organizations, metropolitan and district officials, researchers and NGO representatives, the WRI Türkiye team gathered a range of perspectives and insights to guide the creation of the Livable Caferağa plan.  </p><p>Beginning in July 2023, the WRI Türkiye team hosted a series of training sessions with community members and key stakeholders to build a strong and collective foundation of knowledge on how to create livable, climate-resilient neighborhoods. These sessions explored key aspects of pedestrian safety, active mobility planning and data-driven decision-making.</p><p>Together, the WRI Türkiye team and Caferağa stakeholders examined best practices for improving public spaces, balancing the needs of residents and visitors, mitigating climate challenges like extreme heat and implementing effective urban policies that support sustainable mobility. </p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A snapshot from the Criteria Development Workshop where participants collaboratively evaluated thematic criteria for active mobility planning in the Caferağa neighborhood.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-06/workshop.jpg?VersionId=Us5jbHV42EsTWSEzf3Ca.m00w16WYPnl&itok=l6O70JK2\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A snapshot from the Criteria Development Workshop where participants collaboratively evaluated thematic criteria for active mobility planning in the Caferağa neighborhood.

Some, like the expansion of public transportation with the new ModaBüs shuttle service, will come as soon as the fourth quarter of 2025, while others, like revitalizing pedestrian spaces, will be tackled on an ongoing routine basis.  </p><p>By involving the community at every step of the development process, the WRI Türkiye team ensured that the solutions were responsive to the needs and expectations of Caferağa's residents, and that the community felt a sense of ownership over the plan.  </p><h3>What’s Next for Deep Dives in Istanbul?  </h3><p>The success of this Deep Dive Cities project will inform the next phase of the initiative, which will expand to focus on the entire Kadıköy district. In 2025 and 2026, the WRI Türkiye team will investigate nature-based solutions (NBS) for mitigating urban heat islands, building on the foundation established in Caferağa. With the aim to develop a comprehensive concept plan — complete with pilot applications — for integrating NBS into urban mobility projects, WRI will explore how these solutions can be embedded across Kadıköy’s urban mobility planning.  </p>",

China experienced massive growth in electric buses from 2014 to 2018, a time when other countries had barely started deploying them. In 2017, Shenzhen became the first city in the world to electrify its entire bus fleet (16,000 buses). By 2023, the top 10 global <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/r2z-zero-emission-hdv-china-2023-aug24/\">cities with the most electric bus sales</a> were in China, with Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing leading the way.

Several European countries such as the Netherlands, Finland and Switzerland have achieved very high rates of electric bus adoption.</p><p>India, South Korea and the United States are <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">each home</a> to more than 10,000 electric buses.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\"><noscript><img alt=\"hierarchy visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23674775/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>China: The Primary Electric Bus Player</h3><p>China started deploying electric buses more than a decade ago, becoming the leading electric bus manufacturer and market in the world.</p><p>At first, the government supported electric buses as a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">strategic industry</a>. China saw a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">competitive advantage</a> in pursuing EVs in an already saturated fossil-fuel-vehicle-manufacturing market. City buses were a good candidate for early electrification because they were a public purchase and had fixed routes with a range — on average 120 miles per day — that could operate on a single charge.</p><p>After years of unhealthy smog in China’s most high-profile cities, the desire to reduce air pollution and improve health also became a motivator. The central government began <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">evaluating local officials’</a> performances based on their progress in reducing air pollution, which created an incentive for those officials to electrify transportation. </p><p>In 2009, China began an EV subsidy program in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856422002312\">10 pilot cities</a>. Over time the program added 88 more cities. It was eventually replaced with a national EV subsidy program. The government also put in place favorable polices that <a href=\"https://zfxxgk.ndrc.gov.cn/web/iteminfo.jsp?id=19564\">lowered electricity prices</a> for charging electric buses and <a href=\"https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2015-05/22/content_2866789.htm\">gradually removed</a> its existing subsidies for diesel buses.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23676592/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Cities in China also designed their own policies to make electric buses financially viable. For example, Shenzhen provided city-level subsidies in addition to the national subsidies, which made it <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/db408b53-276c-47d6-8b05-52e53b1208e1/e-bus-case-study-Shenzhen.pdf\">36% cheaper</a> to own an electric bus than a diesel bus over its lifetime. In some cases, the city <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/db408b53-276c-47d6-8b05-52e53b1208e1/e-bus-case-study-Shenzhen.pdf\">leased</a> the buses rather than buying them outright to spread out the costs over the leasing period. </p><p>Many cities also developed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231206-climate-change-how-chinas-electric-vehicle-revolution-began-with-buses\">creative strategies</a> to optimize charging and designed operations schedules to compensate for the electric buses’ shorter ranges and recharging needs. In a few examples, charging infrastructures were built that could be <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/how-did-shenzhen-china-build-worlds-largest-electric-bus-fleet\">shared</a> with electric cars. As Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu, Beijing and many other Chinese cities became <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856422002312\">electric bus leaders</a> and the industry matured, the government gradually <a href=\"https://theicct.org/subsidy-fraud-leads-to-reforms-for-chinas-ev-market/\">scaled down the subsidies</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/ze-mhdv-market-china-january-june-2024-nov24/\">Nearly 100%</a> of city buses sold in China are now electric, an impressive accomplishment, but <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/mainland-chinas-bus-production-in-the-shadow-of-covid19.html\">about half of its bus market</a> is privately-owned coach buses — used for tourism, business and intercity travel. <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/ze-mhdv-market-china-january-june-2024-nov24/\">Only 6%</a> of coach bus sales are electric. Coach buses travel longer distances, where the limited range and long charging times of electric buses can become more challenging. When looking at city and private buses together, since 2017 electric bus sales have <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">plateaued</a> at a little over half of all China’s bus sales.</p><p>For almost a decade, China’s total bus market has been <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/mainland-chinas-bus-production-in-the-shadow-of-covid19.html\">shrinking</a>. Fewer new buses may be needed because so many were deployed in a short amount of time. Also, car ownership has <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/285306/number-of-car-owners-in-china/\">increased rapidly</a> and China now has the world’s most extensive <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-high-speed-rail-cmd/index.html\">high-speed train network</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic also had an impact — urban bus ridership still <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/258560/passenger-trasportation-china-by-public-transport-type/\">has not recovered</a> to pre-2020 levels, and the economic impacts may have decreased city budgets.</p><p>Chinese electric bus companies, however, continue to show they’re a dominant force in the industry. The <a href=\"https://theicct.org/publication/r2z-zero-emission-hdv-china-2023-aug24/\">top 10 electric bus companies</a> worldwide are all Chinese and China’s <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a9e3544b-0b12-4e15-b407-65f5c8ce1b5f/GlobalEVOutlook2024.pdf\">exports</a> account for 30% of the electric buses sold in Europe and more than 85% of the electric buses in Latin America.</p><h3>The Netherlands: An Early Leader in Europe</h3><p>The Netherlands invested heavily in electric buses earlier than any other European country and now has more than 2,100 electric buses on the road.</p><p>In 2016, Dutch transit authorities <a href=\"https://www.interregeurope.eu/good-practices/national-administrative-agreement-zero-emission-buses-bazeb-in-2016-in-the-netherlands\">set</a> the most ambitious target in the world for all new bus sales to be zero-emissions by 2025, with the entire fleet to follow by 2030. The move, which was created as part of <a href=\"https://www.rvo.nl/files/file/2019/06/Misson%20Zero%20Powered%20by%20Holland.pdf\">the Netherlands’ national climate plan</a> to decarbonize transportation, triggered a rapid shift toward electric buses nationwide.</p><p>To facilitate the transition, public transit authorities gave <a href=\"https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bart-kraaijvanger-public-transport-zero-emissions/\">longer contracts</a> to the private electric bus companies that own and operate public transit buses in the Netherlands to help them recoup their investments (15 years instead of 8 to 10 years for diesel). Various cities and regions also provided financial support for the transition. For example, Amsterdam gave direct <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/policies/7222-amsterdam-city-subsidies-for-electric-commercial-vehicles\">subsidies</a> of up to 40,000 euros per bus (about $45,000 based on average 2019 and 2020 exchange rates <span>— </span>when the subsidies began implementation).</p><p>The country also used dynamic <a href=\"https://brainporteindhoven.com/en/business-and-innovation/cases/the-largest-electric-bus-fleet-in-europe-operates-in-brabant\">modeling</a> to plan bus schedules and routes. In some cases, it also used <a href=\"https://www.heliox-energy.com/case-studies/the-worlds-largest-opportunity-depot-charge-network\">opportunity charging systems</a> that allowed for fast charging of the batteries during stops along the route.</p><p>After reaching more than 60% of bus sales, electric buses in the Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">fell</a> in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic caused financial constraints and supply chain bottlenecks, so many electric bus purchases were <a href=\"https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bart-kraaijvanger-public-transport-zero-emissions/\">postponed</a>. Today, the electric bus transition is <a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/ondermaatse-accu-s-kapotte-laadpalen-oude-dieselvloot-neemt-duurzame-elektrische-bussen-weer-over/64387845.html\">still struggling</a> due to overloaded electric grids and technical problems with charging. While the Netherlands has made impressive progress, it is in danger of missing its ambitious targets without making big investments in electric buses and supportive infrastructure.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"><noscript><img alt=\"interactive diagram visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/23790084/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>The rest of the European Union has also been <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\">adding</a> electric buses to its fleets. Electric buses increased from less than 2% of EU bus sales in 2018 to 19% in 2024. An important turning point came in 2019, when the EU adopted a <a href=\"https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/clean-transport/clean-and-energy-efficient-vehicles/clean-vehicles-directive_en\">Clean Vehicles Directive</a> which <a href=\"https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/zero-emission-buses-europe-sept22.pdf\">set binding requirements</a> for publicly-procured buses to be clean, with escalating targets as time goes on. Then in 2024, the EU <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-29-2024-INIT/en/pdf\">released</a> a target for a 90% reduction in city bus carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and a 43% reduction in coach and intercity bus emissions.</p><p>About 70% of the EU’s buses are manufactured by European companies, including MAN and Mercedes-Benz from Germany and Solaris from Poland. Chinese companies <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a9e3544b-0b12-4e15-b407-65f5c8ce1b5f/GlobalEVOutlook2024.pdf\">grew</a> from 10% of the EU market for electric buses in 2017 to 30% in 2023.</p><h3>Chile: Home to the Leading City for Electric Buses Outside of China</h3><p>Chile has <a href=\"https://ebusradar.org/en/\">more than 2,700</a> electric buses in operation as of April 2025, the most of any country in Latin America, with <a href=\"https://ebusradar.org/en/#cities\">about 2,500</a> in its capital city. Santiago now has the <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/From-Pilots-to-Scale-Lessons-from-Electric-Bus-Deployments-in-Santiago-de-Chile?language=en_US\">largest fleet</a> of electric buses of any non-Chinese city, making up <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/en/news/chile-is-now-home-to-the-second-largest-electric-bus-fleet-in-the-world/\">more than a third</a> of its total fleet.</p><p>In 2017, Chile established a <a href=\"https://www.minenergia.cl/archivos_bajar/2018/electromovilidad/estrategia_electromovilidad-27dic.pdf\">national electromobility strategy</a> and in 2021, it announced a <a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/how-santiago-became-one-of-the-first-cities-to-electrify-public-transport-at-scale\">goal</a> of 100% bus electrification by 2035. By 2023, <a href=\"https://www.anac.cl/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Informe-Cero-y-Bajas-Emisiones-Dic23-DatosV2.pdf\">46%</a> of the buses sold in Chile were electric.</p><p>The push to clean up buses in Santiago — one of Latin America’s largest cities and home to 40% of Chile’s population — began out of a desire to reduce air pollution and reduce health impacts; the city was <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/From-Pilots-to-Scale-Lessons-from-Electric-Bus-Deployments-in-Santiago-de-Chile?language=en_US\">one of the most polluted</a> in Latin America in the 1990s.

The new standards increased the cost of diesel buses which made electric buses <a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/how-santiago-became-one-of-the-first-cities-to-electrify-public-transport-at-scale\">more financially feasible</a>. Santiago also required each of its seven bus operators to have <a href=\"https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/reforming-bus-concessions-santiago-de-chile.pdf\">at least 15 electric buses</a>.</p><p>Rather than manufacturing its own electric buses, Santiago imported them from Chinese companies like <a href=\"https://dialogue.earth/en/climate/36128-chinese-electric-buses-rollout-across-latin-america/\">BYD, Yutong and others</a>. The initial rollout cost about $300,000 per electric bus — which is more than diesel models — but each electric bus is expected to <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/656661600060762104/pdf/Lessons-from-Chile-s-Experience-with-E-mobility-The-Integration-of-E-Buses-in-Santiago.pdf\">break even</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/santiago-electric-buses-tco-diesel/\">be more cost-effective</a> than diesel buses over its lifetime due to lower operating and maintenance costs.</p><p> <a href=\"https://theicct.org/chile-latam-lvs-leg-en-apr22/\">Direct government subsidies</a> were not required to create the financial ecosystem that made the bus rollout possible, but city and national support was still needed — for example, by offering <a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/how-santiago-became-one-of-the-first-cities-to-electrify-public-transport-at-scale\">backup financial guarantees</a> to private sector bus operators to incentivize investment. Bus operators, bus manufacturers and utilities <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/From-Pilots-to-Scale-Lessons-from-Electric-Bus-Deployments-in-Santiago-de-Chile?language=en_US\">partnered</a> together to figure out viable financial and logistical options. Like in the Netherlands, bus operators receive <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/How-we-made-e-bus-a-reality-in-Santiago-Chile?language=en_US\">longer contracts</a> for electric buses than diesel buses to recoup investments.</p><p>To build on its success, Santiago will need to <a href=\"https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/From-Pilots-to-Scale-Lessons-from-Electric-Bus-Deployments-in-Santiago-de-Chile?language=en_US\">turn over</a> the rest of its bus fleet quickly.

Governments can follow the <a href=\"https://transformative-mobility.org/multimedia/avoid-shift-improve-framework-explained-in-20-seconds/\">Avoid-Shift-Improve</a> framework: First, plan cities in a compact and transit-oriented way so people can avoid lengthy trips; second, incentivize more people to shift from private passenger cars to <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/transport/shift-public-shared-and-non-motorized-transport\">walking, cycling or public transit</a>; third, improve and optimize transport to be as efficient as possible. For motorized vehicles, this means electrifying not only buses but also <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/countries-adopting-electric-vehicles-fastest\">passenger cars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2023/trends-in-electric-heavy-duty-vehicles\">heavy trucks</a>, while ensuring the electricity comes from <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/power/rapidly-scale-zero-carbon-electricity-generation\">increasingly clean sources</a>.</p><p>While buses are not the biggest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, the transition to electric buses can lead to reduced climate change, healthier air, happier riders, less congestion and improved access to jobs and services for lower-income groups. Electric buses can also serve as a test case for other high-emitting vehicle types like <a href=\"https://systemschangelab.org/transport/transition-zero-carbon-cars-trucks-and-buses?indicatorId=2258&tab=timeline\">heavy trucks</a>.</p><p>Leading countries like China, the Netherlands, Chile and India prove that a rapid transition to electric buses is possible and desirable.</p><p><em>Data for electric bus sales, sales share and fleet size in this article are from the </em><a href=\"http://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer\"><em>International Energy Agency's Global EV Data Explorer</em></a><em>, as of April 2025.

But while efforts often focus on conserving mature forests and planting new trees (both of which are badly needed), a critical piece of the puzzle is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01026-8\">often overlooked</a>: managing naturally regrowing forests to increase the carbon they remove.</p><p>Until now, scientists did not have a detailed picture of the carbon removal value of naturally regrowing forests. But <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02355-5\">new research</a> by The Nature Conservancy, WRI and partners shows that naturally regenerating \"secondary forests\" (which have regrown after being cleared by harvests, severe fires, agriculture or other disturbances) could be especially powerful for fighting climate change. It is the first to show where, and at what ages, they can have the biggest impact.</p><p><strong>We found that secondary forests between 20 and 40 years old can remove carbon from the atmosphere up to 8 times faster per hectare than new natural growth —</strong><em><strong> if</strong></em><strong> they're allowed to reach those older ages. </strong>The catch is that many secondary forests don't regrow for this long, whether due to human activity (such as clearing or harvest) or climate-related disturbances (like fires or pests).</p><p>These findings highlight that countries may be underestimating the value of naturally regenerating secondary forests in their climate reporting — and that protecting them, or encouraging their regrowth for longer periods, offers untapped opportunities for climate action.</p><h3>How Quickly Can Secondary Forests Remove Carbon?</h3><p>The rate at which natural forests remove carbon from the atmosphere varies with location and age. Within a forest's first 100 years of regrowth after being cleared or destroyed — the age range covered in this research — carbon removal rates generally start relatively slow, then accelerate, before slowing again. That means it may take many years before newly established forests provide their largest climate benefits.</p><p>Our new research provides the first global maps of how these carbon removal rates vary across space and time as secondary forests regenerate naturally. The maps cover any square kilometer on Earth where forests could grow. Previous estimates have not captured as much <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/vol4.html\">geographic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2686-x\">age</a> variation or did not provide <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36922608/\">global</a> coverage.</p><p>We found that naturally regenerating forests typically remove carbon fastest when they're between 20 and 40 years old. This means that older secondary forests can provide more immediate and often greater carbon removals than younger regrowing forests.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22205308/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>However, the age at which forests reach their peak carbon removal rates varies across the globe. Tropical and subtropical rainforests (such as the Amazon and the Congo Basin) and some temperate forests (such as in in the United States) capture carbon fastest at younger ages. Meanwhile, boreal forests (like in Canada and Russia), Mediterranean forests, and forested areas in tropical and subtropical savanna regions (such as the Brazilian Cerrado), reach their maximum — and generally lower — carbon removal rates at older ages.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21926583/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Maximum carbon removal rates also vary vastly by region. On average, established secondary forests at their peak removal age absorb 10% more carbon than newly growing forests. But in some areas, the difference is as large as 820%.</p><p>Carbon removal rates change most dramatically with age in tropical and subtropical wet forests, while changes were least pronounced in Mediterranean forests and woodlands. However, there is variation within each of these ecoregions, highlighting the value of knowing how carbon removal changes through time for every square kilometer of potential forest.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21926921/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<div class=\"callout\"><p class=\"secondary body-link\"><strong>About the Data</strong></p><p class=\"secondary\">To better understand carbon removal by naturally regenerating forests, we developed a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02355-5\">global machine learning model</a> that maps carbon removal rates across naturally regenerating forests up to 100 years old. The model combines over 100,000 field plot measurements of carbon stocks at different forest ages for 66 environmental covariates and predicts carbon stocks at 1 kilometer resolution every 5 years as forests age. Then, from the carbon stock maps, we derived carbon accumulation curves. The resulting maps show how much carbon could be removed by allowing forests to regenerate without major disturbances for any forest age and any location where forests naturally occur. (Note that these maps predict what would happen if regeneration does occur, but do not show where natural regeneration could or should occur.)</p></div><h3>Many Secondary Forests Never Reach Peak Carbon Removal Age</h3><p>Knowing when forests remove the most carbon matters. The world urgently needs to scale up climate action over the next 25 years (2025-2050) to achieve net-zero emissions deadlines and protect the planet from the worst effects of climate change. This new data shows that older secondary forests are some of the most effective at removing carbon within this critical window. And it pinpoints when and where regrowing forests pack the biggest climate punch.</p><p>Yet despite their importance, naturally regrowing secondary forests are frequently ignored in climate policy — and they are under threat. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02721-8\">Across the tropics</a>, forests regenerate for an average of 7.5 years before being cut down, with only 6% reaching 20 years of regrowth. In the Brazilian Amazon, <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab76db\">half of secondary forests</a> are cleared within eight years. In Costa Rica, where the clearance cycle is one of the longest in the tropics, the average age for regenerating forest is still only <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12607\">20 years</a>.</p><p>This means that many secondary forests never reach their peak carbon removal years, undercutting their climate benefits as well as the benefits they bring to people and nature. In addition to faster carbon removals, allowing forests to regrow naturally — as opposed to more active planting — can <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/what-assisted-natural-regeneration-benefits-definition\">provide benefits</a> like restoring biodiversity and protecting waterbodies at much lower costs.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"A fire burning in the Amazon Rainforest.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-04/brazil-amazon-fire-deforestation-agriculture-jpg.jpg?VersionId=7gZzhtccKvhimLqWCovXMyQ6fi301JP7&itok=7C1RKToF\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Fire is used to clear an area in the Brazilian Amazon for agricultural use.

This new information provides valuable insights into how to prioritize forest management efforts to maximize their impact:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Secondary forests should be protected or kept growing for longer periods. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Currently, secondary forests are often not prioritized for protection. But it's now possible to quantify the carbon removals that are foregone by cutting these forests down at a young age. While keeping intact and mature forests standing remains crucial, this research shows that protecting secondary forests — or in the case of production forests, delaying clear-cutting until after the peak age for carbon removal — warrants additional attention, as they can often provide the greatest per-hectare carbon removals. Additionally, some forests do not survive to their peak carbon removal age due to windthrow, pests, fire or drought (which are natural disturbances but are exacerbated by climate change). To effectively protect secondary forests, they must be managed for resilience to these risks.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Large-scale natural forest regeneration must start now. </strong></p><p> </p><p>That way, new forests can reach the age at which their carbon removal is greatest within the window of time that carbon removal is most needed to reach climate goals. Our research shows that delaying natural forest regeneration by five or 10 years decreases potential carbon removals globally by a quarter or half through mid-century, respectively, compared to starting natural regeneration in all reforestable areas now.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Policymakers and land managers can begin to make more strategic forest management decisions. </strong></p><p> </p><p>These maps can inform where and when the returns will be greatest from regrowing forests and/or letting forests continue to grow as a <a href=\"https://www.naturebase.org/\">natural climate solution</a>. They can be combined with forest restoration opportunity maps to estimate carbon removal in new forests over specified time horizons. They can also be integrated with maps of the age of naturally regenerating secondary forests and forest loss risk maps to estimate how much more carbon these forests could capture if they are left standing over specified time horizons.</p><p> </p></li><li><p><strong>Countries can improve their carbon accounting and make more accurate climate projections. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Compared to the removal rates in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href=\"https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html\">greenhouse inventory guidelines</a>, which are a common benchmark, the carbon removal rates we found are 26% lower for forests under 20 years old and 18% higher for those aged 20-100 years. (Differences vary by region.) This means governments and others that rely on IPCC rates are likely underestimating carbon removals by older secondary forests. Improved estimates could be used in developing Nationally Determined Contributions, place-based conservation and more.</p></li></ul><p>Protecting secondary forests should go together with conserving mature forests (which have high carbon densities and biodiversity) and investing in restoring forests where they have been lost, which will bring long-term climate and nature benefits. In other words, it shouldn't be one or the other, but all of the above.</p><p>Conservation and restoration also need to be done in ways that benefit the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332220304255\">more than 1 billion people</a> who live near or rely on forests. Secondary forests are often used by low-income or rural communities to support their livelihoods, and their protection must consider the needs, knowledge and wishes of local communities.</p><h3>Informing More Impactful Climate Solutions</h3><p>With <a href=\"https://research.wri.org/gfr/forest-extent-indicators/forest-loss\">forests under attack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/4/xii/ms3-e.htm\">under-valued</a>, the world needs to muster every resource it can to show how much value forests provide and prioritize their protection. Maintaining existing secondary forests, protecting mature forests and enabling new forests to grow are all important for strengthening the global forest carbon sink — but these must be done while also providing food, fiber and other resources on <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore\">finite land</a> for a growing population.</p><p>Mapping carbon removal rates in forests is a rapidly advancing field. More ground data is needed from underrepresented regions, which includes most of the tropics (especially in Africa). We also need a better understanding of the human and environmental factors that affect carbon accumulation in forests. This can help inform <a href=\"https://www.naturebase.org/\">where and how</a> to focus forest protection efforts to maximize <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/tackle-climate-change/climate-change-stories/reforestation-natural-climate-solutions/\">nature-based carbon removals</a> within the context of social needs and other ecosystem benefits.</p><p>These maps provide another line of evidence for the value of forests. The new information can help practitioners and decision-makers focus forest restoration and protection efforts so that they are as effective as possible in averting further climate change.</p><p><em>This article was written in collaboration with Susan Cook-Patton and Nathaniel Robinson of The Nature Conservancy.</em></p>",
