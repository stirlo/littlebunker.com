This is particularly important, as data shows that Native children have <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18595967/\">higher rates of asthma</a>, face <a href=\"https://oasis.library.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1754&context=fac_articles\">longer routes to school</a> and are <a href=\"https://nhts.ornl.gov/\">more likely to ride the school bus</a> than other non-Native students — all concerns associated with emissions from riding diesel buses.</p><p>Without the tailpipe exhaust that emits harmful air pollutants, electric school buses offer a better path than diesel buses, with advantages for air quality, health, climate and long-term costs. Electric buses are also responsible for the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any school bus type, even when accounting for emissions from the generation of electric power.</p><h3>State of Play: Electric School Buses Serving Indian Country</h3><p>As of July 2025, over 400, or about 3%, of the approximately <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/dataset-us-electric-school-bus-adoption\">14,000 electric school buses nationwide</a> serve tribal nations and Native communities across 70 school districts.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\"><noscript><img alt=\"map visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24828831/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Cherokee Nation was the first tribe to transition to electric school buses, with <a href=\"https://ictnews.org/the-press-pool/cherokee-nation-unveils-first-rural-electric-transit-buses-first-electric-school-bus-in-region/\">Sequoyah High School in Oklahoma deploying its first electric school bus</a> in 2021 after receiving funding from several sources including a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2018.

It has also supported community resiliency as demonstrated this past summer when their electric school buses provided power back to their electric utility, Duke Energy, helping reduce grid strain during heat waves.</p><p>It also fostered workforce development opportunities, with three Cherokee Boys Club technicians receiving specialized high-voltage training from the dealer and bus manufacturer. Cherokee Boys Club Service Manager <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/electric-school-bus-ambassadors#DonnieOwleCherokeeBoysClubServiceManager\">Donnie Owle</a> and Master Technician Cliff Cochran also provided high school interns with hands-on electric vehicle (EV) training experience — including converting golf carts to solar electric — preparing community members for participation in the green economy.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1050\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"840\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"643\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"507\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"303\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Two people install electric solar battery in a golf cart.\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/electric-golf-cart_0.jpg?VersionId=qnxjIqOZlh93w.ArlKSwfaObs3kME78j&itok=VRYOLuRP\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Cherokee Central Schools high school students received EV training experience, including how to convert golf cars to solar electric.

Because the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean School Bus Program limits eligibility to certain types of applicants, nonprofit school transportation providers like the Cherokee Boys Club could not apply directly. Instead, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians had to set up complex arrangements to channel grant funds, which added administrative difficulty to the process. In addition, in the early stages of the transition, the Cherokee Boys Club was surprised by the high infrastructure costs for necessary upgrades for EV charger installation. While they were able to work with their partner Duke Energy to cover these expenses, other school districts may need to budget for these upgrades. Districts may also be able to limit power demands by adopting practices such as <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/all-about-managed-charging-and-vehicle-everything-or-v2x\">managed charging</a>.</p><h3>Sipayik Elementary School (Maine Indian Education)</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.maineindianeducation.org/\">Maine Indian Education</a>, through <a href=\"https://www.maineindianeducation.org/article/1579420\">EPA's 2023 Clean School Bus Program rebate</a>, electrified the <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/how-rural-tribal-school-electrified-their-school-bus-fleet\">three buses serving Sipayik Elementary</a>, which educates Passamaquoddy Tribe’s youth who live on the <a href=\"https://wabanaki.com/\">Pleasant Point (Sipayik) Reservation</a> (sharing geography with Maine).</p><article class=\"align-right media media--type-embed media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25300703/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Sipayik Elementary’s transition was motivated by Maine Indian Education’s desire to address high respiratory disease rates among the Passamaquoddy community and reduce emissions and operational costs. The outcomes exceeded expectations with an 80% reduction in Maine Indian Education’s energy costs, 60% reduced maintenance expenses and approximately 25 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per bus avoided each year. The school district intends to reinvest its cost savings into school programs.</p><p>One of the project's most striking aspects lies in the integration of Passamaquoddy cultural values throughout the electrification effort. Instead of the vehicles’ safety feature playing default warning sounds to compensate for the buses’ silent operation, the buses play a traditional Passamaquoddy travel song recorded by tribal elder Wayne Newell during slow speeds. This fusion of language preservation with transportation modernization marks the beginning of Maine Indian Education’s broader vision to integrate cultural education with a curriculum that includes lessons on sustainability, science, math, language, and social sciences.</p><p class=\"secondary\"><em>Listen to a traditional Passamaquoddy travel song performed by tribal elder Wayne Newell:</em></p><p><audio controls=\"controls\" title=\"Recording of the Travel Elder Song played through the electric school bus speakers\">\n    <source src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/2025-10/travel-song.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n    </audio></p><h3>Shawnee Public Schools</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.countywidenews.com/news/sps-receives-142-million-epa-grant-electric-buses\">Shawnee Public Schools</a>, which serves students from the <a href=\"https://www.potawatomi.org/\">Citizen Potawatomi Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.choctawnation.com/about/\">Choctaw Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.muscogeenation.com/\">Muscogee (Creek) Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astribe.com/about-us\">Absentee Shawnee Tribe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sacandfoxnation-nsn.gov/about/\">Sac & Fox Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kickapootribeofoklahoma.com/\">Kickapoo Tribe</a>, <a href=\"https://iowanation.org/about-us/\">Iowa Nation (Baxoje)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sno-nsn.gov/\">Seminole Tribe</a>, pursued electrification for financial savings and air quality benefits.

By assigning the quieter electric school buses to routes with higher rates of behavioral issues, the district saw a <a href=\"https://electricschoolbusinitiative.org/building-resilience-electric-school-buses-rural-oklahoma\">nearly 50% drop</a> in reported incidents between the 2022–2023 and 2024–2025 school years, and drivers noticed that students with sensory sensitivities were more comfortable riding again. At a time when school districts nationwide are struggling to recruit drivers, Shawnee’s electric buses sparked strong interest from diesel bus <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/bus-drivers-reap-electric-school-bus-benefits\">drivers</a>; many requested the cleaner, quieter electric buses, helping the district retain staff and ease short-term staffing pressure.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Electric school bus charging.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/electric-school-bus_0.jpg?VersionId=jJYhRuzFzcnYBR.a9lylg0yDKmLfi3Nm&itok=6TFL0saJ\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>By transitioning half of their fleet to electric school buses, Shawnee Public Schools saved $40,900 in fuel costs during the 2024-2025 school year.

But the school district worked closely with their charging company, who replaced the original chargers with four new charger units, fully resolving the issue.</p><h3>Endazhi-Nitaawiging Charter School</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.redlakecharterschool.com/\">Endazhi-Nitaawiging</a> in Red Lake Nation (sharing geography with Minnesota) is a charter school with the mission of providing their children with an Ojibwe language immersion education grounded in Ojibwe values that is academically rigorous and celebrates Indigenous culture. </p><article class=\"align-right media media--type-embed media--view-mode-half-content\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider\"><noscript><img alt=\"photo-slider visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25300791/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Endazhi-Nitaawiging received its electric school buses through funding awarded to <a href=\"https://www.nativesun.org/electric-nation\">Electric Nation</a>, a joint initiative between Red Lake Nation and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office.</p><p>The motivation for piloting electric school buses stemmed from the desire to provide a clean ride for the high percentage of students whose ride to and from school in this rural community can sometimes take more than an hour. Switching from diesel to electric was viewed as an essential step toward reducing pollution and protecting student health. The benefits soon extended beyond cleaner air. The buses helped spark community-wide interest in renewable energy and electric vehicles, aligning with Red Lake Nation’s broader goals of energy sovereignty and self-determination.</p><p>Getting the project underway was the most significant hurdle for the school. Navigating an unfamiliar industry, identifying manufacturers and building the right partnerships required persistence and teamwork. Those early challenges are now giving way to momentum, as the success of the pilot has encouraged other tribal schools and leaders to pursue electric buses of their own. For these communities, electric school buses are more than just a cleaner mode of transportation, they represent a pathway to healthier commutes, stronger communities and greater control over their energy future.</p><p>In addition to Endazhi-Nitaawiging's electric school bus deployment, Red Lake Schools, a public school operating within Red Lake Nation, has electrified their school bus fleet through a Clean School Bus Program award.</p><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><p>Tribal schools that have begun the transition from diesel to electric school buses emphasize that success depends on careful preparation, strong relationships and community engagement. Their experiences point to common strategies that can help other districts and those working alongside them to navigate the opportunities and challenges of electrification:</p><ul><li><strong>Start early</strong>. Allow ample time for community input, infrastructure assessments and grant applications.</li><li><strong>Build strong partnerships</strong>. Work closely with utility companies, vendors and community stakeholders, and prioritize collaboration with established manufacturers to ensure security and expertise throughout the deployment process.</li><li><strong>Plan thoroughly.</strong> Develop clear route deployment strategies, reliable maintenance services and comprehensive training programs for staff.</li><li><strong>Document and engage.</strong> Collect evidence of community support and assess health impacts to strengthen the case for electric buses and keep transitions people-centered.</li><li><strong>Honor culture and inspire youth</strong>. Incorporate cultural practices, such as blessing ceremonies with community elders, and create opportunities for students to serve as advocates and leaders in clean transportation.</li><li><strong>Know the market.</strong> Become familiar with the range of electric bus manufactures early on to avoid delays and confusion during deployment.</li></ul><p>Tribal nations are proving that the shift to electric school buses is far more than a technological change. By embracing cleaner transportation, they are strengthening community health, reinforcing cultural values and building partnerships that will carry forward for generations. Although tribal schools currently represent only a small share of electric bus adoption nationwide, the experiences of Cherokee Central Schools, Sipayik Elementary School, Shawnee Public Schools and Endazhi-Netaawiging demonstrates what is possible when communities lead with vision and determination.</p><p>Each new electric bus on the road reflects progress and a step toward self-determination. For some tribal nations, including the ones mentioned here, that means embracing electrification, using their current fleet or choosing a different technology. What matters most is that the decision rests with tribal governments to ensure that the future of Native students and their communities is shaped by their own sovereignty and sustainable vision for generations to come.</p><p><em>To find out more about transitioning electric school buses within tribal nations and Native communities, check out these resources:</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wri.org/research/whos-driving-bus-culturally-and-legally-informed-approach-electrifying-student\">Who's Driving This Bus?

      "description": "<p>Climate change is accelerating, threatening lives, livelihoods and economies across the world. In response, countries are stepping up efforts to manage climate risks and shift away from carbon-intensive industries. But alongside the technical and financial challenges posed by this climate transition lies a political and social reality: Without proper attention to the distribution of the costs and benefits of the transition, there may be heightened inequality and political resistance that undermines the transition itself.</p><p>A just transition approach directly addresses this risk and builds a fair, stronger and more resilient pathway to prosperity. By anticipating and managing the social and economic impacts of decarbonization, just transition policies help ensure that the costs of change are not borne disproportionately by vulnerable communities.</p><p>Done well, just transition policies can unlock broad participation in the new green economy, support social protection and reskilling, strengthen local resilience to climate shocks, and mobilize non-state actors behind national climate goals. Neglecting social and equity considerations, by contrast, risks slowing progress, provoking contestation and leaving people more vulnerable to both transition risks and climate impacts.</p><p>To deepen understanding of what enables effective just transitions, WRI supported a series of national dialogues across eight countries: Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/update/what-just-transition-and-why-it-crucial-colombia\">Colombia</a>, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. Five common themes emerged as critical levers: <em><strong>participation and inclusion; assessing and managing the social and economic impacts of the transition; aligning policies across sectors; strengthening governance and institutional capacity; </strong></em><strong>and</strong><em><strong> mobilizing finance at scale</strong></em>. </p><p>Illustrative case studies from each country shows the evidence is clear: Where these enabling factors are supported, just transition efforts can gain traction and accelerate; where they are neglected, transitions risk stalling. Drawing lessons from country experiences, these five levers can advance equitable, resilient and politically viable climate action.</p><h3>1) Participation and Inclusion</h3><p>Inclusive and participatory stakeholder engagement is not just a matter of fairness — it is central to building the legitimacy, acceptance and momentum needed for a successful transition. Ensuring meaningful representation of impacted stakeholders, especially women, youth, informal sector workers and Indigenous communities, allows policies to respond to lived realities while broadening the constituency for climate action. Bottom-up approaches that localize problems and solutions build trust, reduce conflict and ensure that communities most affected by the transition can shape its direction.</p><p>Kenya offers valuable lessons in this regard. Localized engagement — whether through research co-designed with communities, dialogues held in local languages or forums that amplify the voices of women and marginalized groups — has proven effective in grounding policy responses in lived experience. Projects such as <a href=\"https://www.hoperaisersinitiative.com/future-yetu#:~:text=He%20is%20a%20mentor%20focusing,and%20sports%20in%20his%20community.&text=Through%20a%20mobile%20Matatu%20exhibition,around%20the%20streets%20of%20Korogocho.\">Future Yetu</a> in Nairobi’s informal settlements used storytelling to link climate impacts with community-driven solutions. <a href=\"https://pacida.org/climate-change/\">Pastoralist Community Initiative and Development Assistance </a> in northern Kenya mobilized pastoralist communities through culturally appropriate methods, ensuring climate plans reflected local priorities. Women’s climate forums in Kwale County demonstrated how targeted spaces can surface practical solutions — from drought-resistant crops to sustainable energy — that might otherwise be overlooked. The lesson is clear: Inclusive engagement strengthens both the quality and relevance of policy outcomes.</p><p>Brazil has experimented with scaling inclusivity to the national level. Through the <a href=\"https://brasilparticipativo.presidencia.gov.br/processes/planoclima/f/145/\">Brasil Participativo</a> platform, citizens are invited to propose, debate and vote on ideas feeding into the country’s updated national climate plan. The process has already drawn tens of thousands of participants and generated over a thousand proposals. While challenges remain — particularly in reaching communities without internet or reliable energy access — the initiative shows how participatory democracy can be harnessed to embed just transition principles across national strategies.</p><p>Taken together, these experiences highlight that participation and inclusion are not only about protecting vulnerable groups; they are also about broadening the social base for climate action. When communities see their priorities reflected in policies, they are more likely to support and defend them. In this way, inclusion strengthens both the equity and the political durability of the transition, ensuring it can move forward with legitimacy and momentum.</p><h3>2) Assessing and Managing the Social and Economic Impacts of the Transition</h3><p>A just transition depends on understanding who wins, who loses and how benefits and risks are distributed as economies shift. Without this knowledge, climate policies can create unintended consequences that undermine livelihoods, deepen inequality and provoke resistance. By contrast, careful analysis of social and economic impacts allows governments to anticipate risks, design targeted protections and unlock the full growth potential of a green economy.</p><p>India’s experience in the brick-making industry illustrates both the risks and opportunities. Pollution-reduction policies are driving a shift away from traditional kilns, which employ large numbers of informal workers with limited safety nets. Introducing cleaner technologies such as <a href=\"https://www.ccacoalition.org/sites/default/files/resources/Bricks-SEA.pdf\">fixed chimney bull’s trench kilns</a> can reduce emissions and health impacts, but their success depends on investment in <a href=\"https://wri-india.org/perspectives/breaking-mold-transforming-bihars-brick-kilns\">training</a> for both workers and owners. This example demonstrates how climate policies must be accompanied by strategies to reskill vulnerable workers and adapt technologies to local contexts. Otherwise, environmental gains risk being offset by social dislocation.</p><p>Ethiopia demonstrates the power of investing in modelling and data to guide decision-making. By building technical capacity in systems dynamics modelling, the government has projected the potential costs and benefits of different transition pathways. These analyses revealed opportunities for growth in renewables, transport, forestry and climate-smart agriculture, while identifying risks in traditional agriculture and industry. The results directly informed the country’s <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/ETHIOPIA_%20LONG%20TERM%20LOW%20EMISSION%20AND%20CLIMATE%20RESILIENT%20DEVELOPMENT%20STRATEGY.pdf\">long-term low emissions development strategy</a> and nationally determined contribution (NDC), embedding social and economic considerations into national development planning. This kind of rigorous modelling can help governments manage risks proactively while aligning climate strategies with growth and jobs.</p><p>Across these cases, it is evident that deliberately seeking to understand the social and economic impacts of climate policies is a prerequisite for socially responsive policies. Careful data gathering, robust analysis and continuous monitoring enable policymakers to design measures that cushion vulnerable groups, seize new opportunities and ensure that climate action contributes to shared prosperity.</p><h3>3) Aligning Policies Across Sectors</h3><p>Managing climate transitions is not the responsibility of any single ministry. The impacts of decarbonization span energy, industry, labor, agriculture, transport and social protection, therefore, achieving a just transition requires coordinated action across government. Ministries responsible for economic planning, labor markets, industrial policy and social protection must work hand in hand with sectoral line ministries. A robust national framework that explicitly integrates climate and just transition principles can provide the foundation for this alignment — ensuring that economic, social and environmental goals reinforce rather than contradict each other.</p><p>Colombia shows how integrated frameworks can create coherence. Its long-term climate strategy (<a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/COL_LTS_Nov2021.pdf\">E2050</a>) and <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2025-09/NDC%203.0%20Declarativa%20Colombia%20Transformaciones%20para%20la%20Vida%20V.25.09.2025%20Gob.%20Nacional.pdf\">NDC</a> embed just transition principles at the national level, while sectoral roadmaps provide more detailed guidance. The Ministry of Mines and Energy’s Just Energy Transition Roadmap outlines plans to decarbonize the energy sector, expand renewables and diversify local economies in coal-dependent regions. Complementing this, the Ministry of Labor is developing a phased National Just Transition Workforce Strategy to drive green job creation and reskilling across sectors, starting with energy and moving progressively into agriculture, transport, commerce and construction. This alignment across ministries ensures that decarbonization efforts are matched with labor market strategies and regional development planning, thereby reducing the risks of dislocation and unlocking new growth opportunities.</p><p>Yet, Colombia’s experience also highlights the need to bridge public–private divides. Business leaders voiced frustration about being excluded from international climate negotiations despite being essential to implementation. The government responded by initiating structured dialogues with private actors after the 2024 UN climate change summit (COP29), a first step toward more effective coordination. The lesson from this experience is clear: Alignment is needed not only across ministries, but also between governments, businesses, workers and civil society. Without the involvement of these different actors, implementation will falter.</p><p>Beyond coordinating across ministries and sectors, Brazil demonstrates the benefits of aligning social and economic goals with climate objectives. By emphasizing high-quality job creation, reducing inequality and prioritizing support for youth, women and marginalized communities, the new Brazil ecological transformation plan ensures that decarbonization delivers inclusive development. Anchoring social protection, health care and welfare in transition planning builds security for workers and communities, while skills development programs prepare people to seize new opportunities. This comprehensive approach demonstrates that when social policy and climate policy are integrated, the transition becomes a driver of equity as well as growth.</p><p>These cases show that alignment is not an administrative exercise, but a political and economic imperative. Coordinated responses across ministries and with social partners ensure that climate action supports jobs, growth and equity. When policy coherence is achieved, climate transitions can generate broad socio-economic benefits and build durable support for ambitious climate action.</p><h3>4) Strengthening Governance and Institutional Capacity</h3><p>Policy alignment alone is insufficient without the governance mechanisms and institutional capacity to make it real. Managing a climate transition requires not only clear strategies, but also the ability to coordinate across government, engage stakeholders and implement sectoral programs at scale. Weak institutions or fragmented responsibilities can derail even the most carefully designed plans. By contrast, strong governance systems that bring together diverse actors — across ministries, levels of government, business, labor and civil society — create the foundation for effective implementation and durable political support.</p><p>South Africa provides a valuable example of how governance structures can be built to underpin a just transition. At the advisory level, the <a href=\"https://www.climatecommission.org.za/\">Presidential Climate Commission (PCC)</a> has played a critical role in building consensus across stakeholders. Chaired by the country’s president and drawing in government, labor, business, civil society, youth and traditional leadership, the PCC has provided a forum for negotiating trade-offs, shaping the national <a href=\"https://pccommissionflo.imgix.net/uploads/images/22_PAPER_Framework-for-a-Just-Transition_revised_242.pdf\">Just Transition Framework</a> and monitoring progress. Its inclusive composition has given legitimacy to the transition agenda and helped ensure that diverse perspectives are represented.</p><p>Yet the PCC is only part of the governance solution. Implementation capacity has been bolstered by the establishment of the <a href=\"https://justenergytransition.co.za/about\">Just Energy Transition Project Management Unit (JET PMU)</a>, which provides technical and coordination support to government. Working through an inter-ministerial committee, the JET PMU has ensured political oversight at the highest level while driving alignment across departments. Importantly, it has supported line ministries — such as energy, transport and higher education — to take the lead on delivering specific components of the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan. Subnational governments (provinces and municipalities) have also been engaged as partners in the energy transition. This dual structure, combining participatory advisory mechanisms with an operational coordination unit, has enabled South Africa to move from planning to implementation.</p><p>The lesson is clear: Governance capacity is as important as technical and financial resources. Countries need institutions that can integrate stakeholder voices, build consensus and monitor progress, while also ensuring that sectoral ministries, subnational governments and social partners have the capacity to deliver on their respective roles. Where governance is strong, transitions gain coherence, legitimacy and momentum; where it is weak, policies risk stalling or fragmenting.</p><h3>5) Mobilizing Finance at Scale</h3><p>A just transition cannot be delivered without finance — not only for decarbonization technologies, but also for the social and economic measures that make the transition fair and durable. Investment is needed to reskill workers, diversify regional economies, strengthen social protection and build resilience in vulnerable communities. Mobilizing finance at scale from domestic and international, public and private sources is therefore essential. Importantly, financing strategies must be designed to ensure the equitable distribution of benefits, reaching not only large infrastructure projects but also small enterprises, informal workers and community-led initiatives that are critical to inclusive transitions.</p><p>Indonesia’s experience shows both the opportunities and the gaps in aligning finance with just transition objectives. The country’s Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs launched the Global Blended Finance Alliance (GBFA) in 2022 in an effort to mobilize and scale blended finance instruments to support climate and development goals. By building institutional capacity and encouraging <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/indonesia/press-releases/sdg-linked-global-blended-finance-alliance-gbfa-marks-milestone-undp-tony-blair-institute-join-platform\">multi-stakeholder partnerships</a>, the GBFA could play an important role in financing transition efforts. However, difficulties in channeling global funds such as the Just Energy Transition Partnership to industry players highlight a persistent challenge: resources often flow to governments and state-owned enterprises, while private sector actors — including local firms that create jobs and drive regional diversification — remain constrained. As such, financing frameworks must deliberately include mechanisms to support businesses, workers and regions most exposed to transition risks, ensuring that financial flows extend beyond the energy sector into wider social and economic priorities.</p><p>Rwanda offers another perspective on how finance can advance just transition outcomes. With support from the World Bank, the <a href=\"https://www.brd.rw/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRD_Annual_Report_2024.pdf\">Renewable Energy Fund</a> expanded electricity access to more than 2 million people, created over 4,000 jobs, and catalyzed private investment in Rwanda. These are important social and economic co-benefits. Yet the government has identified a significant funding gap to reach universal electrification and faces barriers including high local lending rates and limited specialized financing mechanisms. The lesson here is that financing strategies must be intentionally structured to advance equity and resilience: By building local financial sector capacity, tailoring instruments such as green bonds or impact bonds to national contexts and prioritizing affordability for vulnerable households, finance can become a lever not just for energy access, but for inclusive economic participation and regional development.</p><p>These examples demonstrate that mobilizing finance at scale is not only about raising capital for low-carbon infrastructure but also about designing financial mechanisms that embed just transition priorities. By explicitly funding skills, diversification, social support and resilience, financing strategies can unlock the socio-economic benefits of the transition and build durable public and political support for climate action.</p><h3>Sharing Lessons Learned Across Countries to Support Just Transitions</h3><p>Experiences from Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa show that while the pathways differ, the underlying lesson is the same: Just transitions work best when they combine ambition with inclusion. Across these contexts, five levers — participation and inclusion, understanding social and economic impacts, policy alignment, governance capacity, and financing strategies — have emerged as critical to ensuring that climate action delivers not only emissions reductions but also jobs, resilience and equity.</p><p>Neglecting these dimensions risks social dislocation, political resistance and stalled progress. Supporting them, by contrast, builds legitimacy, expands the social base for climate action, and unlocks economic opportunities that make the transition both fair and feasible. Importantly, the equity dimension is not limited to decarbonization: climate impacts themselves fall hardest on vulnerable communities, making resilience and social protection core components of a fair transition.</p><p>The country experiences reviewed here highlight the importance of cross-country learning. While no single model can be transplanted wholesale, the common challenges and solutions underscore the value of sharing knowledge and best practices across contexts. Building platforms for this exchange — particularly among countries in the Global South — will be critical to accelerating progress.</p><p>Just transitions are not only a moral imperative, but a practical necessity for effective and politically viable climate action. By embedding social and economic priorities into transition strategies, countries can transform the risks of climate change into an opportunity for inclusive growth and resilient development.</p>",

      "pubDate": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 07:00:00 EDT",
      "description": "<p>The world is racing to increase supplies of lithium, cobalt, copper and other \"critical minerals\" that are building blocks of modern technology. Not only are these minerals used in industries like defense, healthcare and electronics, but they are also key to producing the clean energy technologies that are increasingly powering our lives.</p><p>Yet critical minerals present an environmental and social conundrum. While necessary in the fight against climate change, mining and processing of these minerals can drive greenhouse gas emissions, pollute the environment and bring risks to nearby communities. Mining and production are also concentrated in a small handful of countries, and surging demand is adding to geopolitical tensions — from trade disputes to global debates over the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained\">deep-sea mining</a>.</p><p>There is no question the world will need a lot more of these minerals, and quickly. But how do we meet this demand in a way that's responsible and equitable?</p><h3>What Are Critical Minerals and Why Do They Matter?</h3><p>Critical minerals are those that are essential to countries' economies or development. They are generally in high demand and prone to supply chain disruptions, although countries differ on which minerals they define as \"critical\" depending on their level of access, what the minerals are used for, their export value and national supply risks.</p><p>Most countries' critical mineral lists include copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements. These are used widely in clean energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels, EV batteries and motors, as well as in energy transmission infrastructure like power lines. Additional minerals important for the energy transition include aluminum, manganese, silicon and silver, among others.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\"><noscript><img alt=\"table visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24953742/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Many critical minerals are integral to other industries as well. NATO includes several on its list of <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_231765.htm\">essential raw materials</a> for defense. And they are needed to manufacture the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip\">semiconductors</a> that underpin our electronics, from smartphones and computers to lighting and medical devices.</p><p>While the terms \"rare earth elements\" and \"critical minerals\" are sometimes used interchangeably, the two are not the same. Rare earth elements are a subset of critical minerals that includes 17 elements (such as neodymium, promethium and cerium) used extensively in clean energy systems and other advanced technologies. Contrary to their name, rare earth elements tend not to be rare. The challenge is that they are often found in very low concentrations and are intermingled with other minerals, making it difficult and uneconomical to extract them.</p><h3>Can the World Meet Growing Mineral Demand?</h3><p>Rapid growth in zero-carbon technology has supercharged the world's need for critical minerals, and demand is expected to keep climbing. The <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/c7716240-ab4f-4f5d-b138-291e76c6a7c7/CriticalMineralsMarketReview2023.pdf\">International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates</a> that if governments are to meet their announced energy and climate pledges, critical mineral demand could more than double from 2022 levels by 2030 and quadruple by 2050.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24953562/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<p>Despite this high demand, there are likely enough critical minerals to meet the world's need. But the reality of accessing them is complex. Some critical minerals, like aluminum and palladium, have stable reserves on land that can fulfil the world's demand through 2050 and likely beyond. For others, like copper, nickel and cobalt, current reserves are <a href=\"https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETC-Materials-ExecSummary_highres-1.pdf\">likely to come up short</a>, and it will take a combination of more exploration, technological advances and economic incentives to increase supply.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24956632/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>New mining requires long lead times.</h4><p>Part of the challenge with scaling up critical mineral supplies is that mining operations move slowly. From discovery to first production, it takes an average of 15.5 years to develop new mining projects, depending on the mineral, location and mine type. Long lead times raise questions about the world's ability to ramp up output as demand grows, especially if companies wait for deficits to emerge before committing to new projects.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24953873/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h4>Mining and processing are concentrated in a handful of countries.</h4><p>Extraction and processing of critical minerals are highly concentrated, both in terms of geography and ownership. For example, <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025.pdf\">in 2023</a>, Indonesia held 42% of global nickel reserves and 54% of global nickel production, while the Democratic Republic of Congo held 55% of global cobalt reserves and 74% of global cobalt production.</p><p>Once mined, the majority of these minerals are shipped to China for processing before they can be applied in end uses. China <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ee01701d-1d5c-4ba8-9df6-abeeac9de99a/GlobalCriticalMineralsOutlook2024.pdf\">processes</a> more than half of the world's lithium, two-thirds of its cobalt, one-third of its nickel and nearly all rare earth elements.</p><p>China's dominance in processing stems from early strategic investments in global mining and its history of looser environmental standards — although lax <a href=\"https://www.energy-transitions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETC-Materials-ExecSummary_highres-1.pdf\">regulations are tightening</a> as harms from irresponsible mining come to light. The country's longstanding investment in clean energy development has also propelled it as a leader in mineral-intensive EV battery and solar panel manufacturing, driven by a combination of relatively low, capital and land costs.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24955266/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>How Is the World Responding to Supply Risks?</h3><p>As countries move to protect their national security and energy independence, critical minerals have become a central point of conflict. Some with a healthy mineral supply, like China, have <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions\">imposed export restrictions</a> as a geopolitical lever, heightening the urgency for other countries to build up their domestic supplies. For example, the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to establish a secure and dependable critical minerals value chain for the bloc. In the U.S., the Mine of the Future initiative provides <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/us-department-energy-launches-mine-future-initiatives-bolster-us-mining-industry\">nearly $100 million</a> in funding to accelerate research, innovative mining technologies and commercialization, while the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-trumps-new-critical-minerals-executive-order\">Defense Production Act</a> elevates critical minerals as a national security imperative.</p><p>Some countries — such as the U.S., EU, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea — have joined international initiatives like the IEA Critical Minerals Security Programme and the Minerals Security Partnership to work together on strengthening critical mineral security and scaling up investments in sustainable supply chains. China's partnerships through its Belt and Road Initiative, which supports infrastructure development mainly in developing and emerging economies, have been instrumental in the country's ability to dominate mineral processing.</p><p>Several countries and companies are also racing to pursue deep sea mining, a frontier area of exploration. The ocean floor is estimated to hold significant reserves of copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, silver, gold and rare earth elements. Recent technological advancements have made it possible to readily access these minerals; however, little is known about the deep ocean, and research suggests mining it could <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained\">pose grave environmental threats</a>.</p><h3>What Are the Dangers Associated with Critical Mineral Mining?</h3><p>All mining has social and environmental impacts. These can sometimes be positive; for example, responsible, industrialized mining may bring jobs, income and services to areas with few other economic opportunities. But there are also serious risks to nature and communities, particularly when it comes to irresponsible and illegal extraction.</p><p>For one, extracting, processing and shipping minerals releases planet-warming emissions. Global mining already represents <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00346-4\">about 8%</a> of the world's carbon footprint, and emissions from critical mineral production <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/sustainable-and-responsible-development-of-minerals\">will grow</a> alongside demand.</p><p>Mining can also strain water quality and supplies. <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/critical-minerals-mining-water-impacts\">Sixteen percent</a> of critical mineral mines, deposits and districts are in highly water-stressed areas (places that already use 40% of their available water each year to meet demand). This means there is high competition for water and sometimes not enough left over to sustain important freshwater ecosystems. If mining waste isn't managed properly, it can leach hazardous materials like acidic mine drainage or tailings impoundments (process waste) into the surrounding environment and contaminate groundwater.</p><p>Between 2001 and 2020, the world lost nearly <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/how-mining-impacts-forests\">1.4 million hectares</a> of forest to mining and related activities, an area of land roughly the size of Montenegro. Felling trees not only releases emissions (<a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/how-mining-impacts-forests\">36 million tonnes</a> of carbon dioxide equivalent a year), but also harms ecosystems. And it often involves extensive removal of vegetation and soil that Indigenous and local communities depend on for food and livelihoods.</p><p>While mining may help bolster local economies, it has a track record of social harm when not well regulated. For example, of the 255,000 workers engaged in small-scale mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/drc-mining-industry-child-labor-and-formalization-small-scale-mining\">40,000 are children</a> — some as young as six years old. Communities may face also forced displacement, loss of traditional livelihoods, and health risks linked to pollution from mines.</p><p>When it comes to ocean mining, there are many unknowns. But <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained\">the research available</a> suggests the practice could irreparably harm fragile deep-sea ecosystems. It could also affect species beyond the ocean floor, including fish like tuna that are vital to food security.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  \">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"1181\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1575\" />\n              <source height=\"945\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1260\" />\n              <source height=\"724\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"965\" />\n              <source height=\"570\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"760\" />\n              <source height=\"341\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"455\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Large mining operation cut out of a forest with roads and excavators.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/455_wide/s3/2025-10/nickel-mining-indonesia_0.jpg?VersionId=OMPbLT9vVuU_TISZZJao.B6oqRevXofL&itok=EgjHGTHv\" width=\"455\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>A nickel mining operation in Indonesia. Critical mineral mining can drive deforestation, among other environmental and social challenges.

This will require: <em>1)</em> ensuring that all mining is done responsibly, and<em> 2) </em>encouraging a circular mineral economy to minimize demand for new extraction.</p><h4>Mainstream responsible mining.</h4><p>Responsible mining means extracting critical minerals in a way that safeguards the environment and respects people and communities. Several different levers can support responsible mining, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Standards: </strong>An overarching international framework for critical minerals can help regulate and compare companies' environmental, social and governance efforts in a meaningful way. There are numerous protocols already in place — such as the <a href=\"https://responsiblemining.net/\">Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tsminitiative.com/\">Toward Sustainable Mining</a> and <a href=\"https://coppermark.org/\">The Copper Mark</a> — but they need to be used more widely. Efforts to harmonize industry-led standards, such as the <a href=\"https://miningstandardinitiative.org/\">Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative</a>, are currently underway.</li><li><strong>Regulations: </strong>Countries can encourage or even require responsible mineral supply chains through policymaking. Regulatory levers may address trade and export controls, resource management, international cooperation and supply chain security. The <a href=\"https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/development-and-sustainability/conflict-minerals-regulation/regulation-explained_en\">EU's Conflict Minerals Regulation</a>, for example, requires that gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum be sourced from conflict-free areas across the world.</li><li><strong>Technology: </strong>Technological advancements can help mining companies reduce their impact. For example, mining companies operating in water-scarce areas are increasingly required to develop desalination plants so they don't put pressure on limited freshwater supplies.</li><li><strong>Transparency and accountability:</strong> Through groups like <a href=\"https://eiti.org/\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a> (EITI), countries can commit to disclose information along their mineral value chains. Organizations like the <a href=\"https://accountabilityaccelerator.org/\">Accountability Accelerator</a> can help hold stakeholders responsible for their mining activities, with consequences for inaction.</li><li><strong>Market-based incentives:</strong> Large buyers like governments and companies can exert their influence through green procurement, committing to purchase only critical minerals that have been responsibly mined. Companies can also join forces through corporate buyers' clubs and can opt to pay a green premium for products that have met specific environmental, social and governance targets. Financing is also an important lever, and groups like <a href=\"https://mining2030.org/\">Mining 2030</a> are looking to define the role of finance in realizing a socially and environmentally responsible mining sector.</li></ul><h4>Promote a circular economy.</h4><p>A shift from our current economic model of \"make-use-discard\" to one that emphasizes reduction, reuse and recycling can ease resource pressures, helping to minimize the need for new mining and the impacts that come with it.</p><p>Critical mineral use can be <strong>reduced</strong> through material-efficient products. For example, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/electric-vehicles-smaller-better\">more and more EV models</a> on the market are SUVs and other larger passenger vehicles that require larger batteries and therefore more minerals. Governments can encourage car manufacturers and consumers to opt for smaller vehicles through measures like the EU's recently announced Small Affordable Cars Initiative. New technologies can also help substitute demand; for example, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01197-7\">cobalt-free EV batteries</a> rely on cheaper, more abundant resources, such as iron and phosphate.</p><p><strong>Reusing </strong>older clean energy components after the end of their \"first life\" can keep minerals in circulation. Retired EV batteries, for example, often retain 70%-80% of their capacity and could be used in renewable energy storage, EV charging stations and microgrids. Retired commercial solar panels could power off-grid structures like electric bike stations or community solar systems. This can help reduce waste while creating new jobs and expanding access to clean energy. However, second-life use needs to be properly managed to avoid becoming a loophole for waste dumping in lower-income countries. ​</p><p>Increasing mineral <strong>recycling </strong>could reduce the need for new mine development by 40% for copper and cobalt and 25% for lithium and nickel by 2050. Though in near-term, improvements in recycling may be outpaced by rising material consumption. For instance, the share of total copper demand that was supplied by secondary or recycled copper actually fell from 37% in 2015 to 33% in 2023.</p><p>Fortunately, policy momentum in support of recycling is gaining strength. Since 2022, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/critical-minerals-policy-tracker\">more than 30 new policies</a> related to critical mineral recycling have been introduced globally. These include India's 2022 Battery Waste Management Rules, which regulate the recycling and management of all batteries, and Vietnam's Decree No.8/2022/ND-CP, which mandates recycling rates and specifications for producers and importers of specific products, including batteries and solar cells.</p><article class=\"media media--type-embed media--view-mode-full\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-media-embed-code field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24955398/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div>\n      \n  </article>\n<h3>Confronting the Mineral Conundrum</h3><p>Critical minerals underpin the world's efforts to build a cleaner, safer future for all. But they are not without risks. As surging demand spurs geopolitical tensions and environmental and social concerns, the need for meeting this demand responsibly is paramount. Countries and companies must work together to ensure that supply chains are not only secure, but sustainable — and that we're making the most of the minerals already in play to minimize the need for new extraction as much as possible.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Building solutions for urban peripheries — the sprawling, poorly served, low-income informal neighborhoods on the outskirts of Brazilian cities — requires recognizing their value.</p><p>Brazilian peripheries, while poor, often have knowledge, organizational forms and collective practices that are already helping provide concrete responses to everyday challenges. Insights from these existing efforts can support more sustainable solutions for structural issues, such as access to decent housing and basic urban services in the face of the climate crisis.</p><p>The need to better understand and support homegrown solutions in informal neighborhoods has fueled the urban laboratories of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/initiatives/transformative-urban-coalitions?utm_medium=redirect&utm_source=wrirosscities&utm_campaign=cities\">Transformative Urban Coalitions</a>, a project co-led by WRI in Brazil and Mexico, the United Nations University’s Institute for Environment and Human Security, the International Institute for Environment and Development, and the German Institute for Development and Sustainability.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/noticias/cidades-brasileiras-abordagens-locais-inovadoras-crise-climatica\">Since 2022</a>, resident-led coalitions in Comunidade do Pilar in Recife and Residencial Edgar Gayoso in Teresina have developed <a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/atividades/mutiroes-realizam-transformacoes-em-comunidades-de-recife-e-teresina\">bottom-up solutions</a>, strengthened ties and <a href=\"https://www.wribrasil.org.br/atividades/como-qualificacao-de-territorios-vulneraveis-em-recife-e-teresina-gera-acesso\">created opportunities</a> to address climate change and other challenges.</p><p>Now, the success of these projects is trickling up. In 2024, the Brazilian federal government launched <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/cidades/pt-br/novo-pac-selecoes-2025/periferia-viva-urbanizacao-de-favelas\">Periferia Viva</a>, a federal program for slum urbanization led by the National Secretariat for Peripheries. The program directs federal investments toward integrated urban development in peripheral communities across the country, with the goal of transforming 58 marginalized communities across Brazil by promoting slum upgrading, <a href=\"https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Land-Regularization-and-Administration-Projects-A-Comparative-Evaluation.pdf\">land regularization</a>, new social housing and community participation.</p><h3>From Local Experience to National Impact</h3><p>One of these communities is Peixinhos in Olinda, just north of Recife. There, under Periferia Viva, a new “territorial post” provides a physical space for the program’s technical assistance teams to co-create interventions with residents and oversee implementation.</p><p>Lessons learned from Transformative Urban Coalitions are reflected in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/cidades/pt-br/assuntos/publicacoes/arquivos/arquivos/periferias/plano-de-acao-periferia-viva_v16.pdf/\">Periferia Viva Action Plan Guide</a>, a set of recommendations and steps for implementing the action plan, aimed at equipping local actors to deliver inclusive and resilient solutions on the ground.

      "description": "<p><strong>WASHINGTON (October 1, 2025) </strong>— Today, World Resources Institute's <a href=\"https://p4gpartnerships.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030</a> (P4G) awarded $3.8 million in grants and technical assistance to 14 climate startups across Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. This funding will help these early-stage businesses grow breakthrough solutions — from clean cooling systems in Vietnam to water-absorbing pavers in Indonesia, and solar-powered dryers for agricultural crops in Kenya<em> </em>— making them investment-ready to accelerate green growth in emerging markets. </p><p>Mobilizing climate finance is one of the most urgent priorities of our time. Achieving this requires unprecedented investment in innovative solutions that can rapidly reduce emissions, build resilience and support a just transition for communities around the world. Yet in emerging markets, startups with promising solutions often face steep barriers to growth.  </p><p>While graduation rates from early-stage funding – commonly known as seed – to their first major investment round (Series A) <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/cb/insights/banking/commercial-banking/cb-insights-banking-startup-insights-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">average 20–30%</a> in developed markets, they drop to around <a href=\"https://www.lavca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LAVCA_Startup-Ecosystem-Insights_2024-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">10%</a> in Latin America and just <a href=\"https://partechpartners.com/africa-reports/2024-africa-tech-venture-capital-report/equity-breakdown\" target=\"_blank\">5%</a> in Africa. Common challenges include financial modeling, preparing investor documentation and developing effective pitch and marketing materials. </p><p>P4G bridges these gaps by pairing startups with nonprofits and technical experts to strengthen their business models, ESG strategies and market positioning. Through its National Platforms – public-private coalitions at the country level – P4G also connects startups with government agencies, facilitates policy dialogues and hosts workshops to foster a more enabling environment for climate businesses. </p><p>“Climate startups are powerful engines of innovation and play a key role in accelerating the transition to a low-carbon future,” said <strong>Robyn McGuckin, Executive Director, P4G</strong>. “From working closely with these entrepreneurs, we’ve seen how targeted funding and hands-on support can unlock their full potential – helping them scale faster, create jobs, boost local economies and deliver climate solutions that the world can’t afford to wait for.”  </p><p>One of the newly funded partnerships, <a href=\"https://p4gpartnerships.org/pioneering-green-partnerships/all-p4g-partnerships/vox-cool-assist\" target=\"_blank\">VOX Cool – ASSIST Vietnam</a>, will use its funds to scale “Cold Battery” technology — an affordable, low-emission cooling solution that stores thermal energy for when it’s needed most. By ensuring reliable, energy-efficient refrigeration, it cuts electricity costs, reduces fossil fuel reliance and prevents food spoilage.  </p><p>“We are scaling a technology that not only reduces food loss and emissions in Vietnam but can also serve as a model for how emerging markets build more efficient and cleaner cold chain systems,” <strong>said Dr. Khoa Le, co-founder and CEO, VOX Cool</strong>. “With P4G’s support, we can scale faster, create greater value for farmers and businesses, and demonstrate how innovative cooling can drive both economic growth and climate action.”  </p><p>Other partnerships receiving funding include: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://p4gpartnerships.org/pioneering-green-partnerships/all-p4g-partnerships/parsons-kinetics-acosol\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Parsons Kinetics - ACOSOL</strong></a><strong> </strong>– patented wind turbines inspired by the aerodynamics of the Varasanta tree seed in Colombia.</li><li><a href=\"https://p4gpartnerships.org/reservoair-kopernik\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ReservoAir - Kopernik</strong></a><strong> </strong>– porous pavers that absorb water 100x faster than conventional paver and reduces the risk of flooding in Indonesia.</li><li><a href=\"https://p4gpartnerships.org/pioneering-green-partnerships/all-p4g-partnerships/synnefa-solidaridad\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Synnefa - Solidaridad</strong></a><strong> </strong>– Solar dryers that use smart technology to cut agricultural crop drying time from weeks to just 2–3 days in Kenya. </li></ul><p>These startups provide real-world evidence of what works to tackle pressing challenges in food systems, energy, transport and water, helping to attract private sector investment and de-risk the climate innovation space.   </p><p>Since 2018, P4G-backed partnerships have leveraged this support to raise over $211 million in commercial and non-commercial investments, create over 17,000 green jobs, produce nearly 7.9 million metric liters of clean water, reclaim more than 130,000 metric tons of waste and revitalize over 307,000 hectares of land with climate smart agricultural practices. These outcomes underscore P4G’s long-term commitment to catalyzing green growth and scaling market-based climate solutions in emerging economies. </p><p>P4G received 167 applications for this round of funding.

While energy transitions are often imagined as a complicated political process that requires long-term planning, international climate finance or industrial policy, Pakistan proves a different story is possible: A revolution driven by market forces, rather than climate-driven or state-led green policies.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Rooftop solar panels in the city of Karachi, Pakistan. \" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-10/pakistan-solar-panels-rooftops_0.jpg?VersionId=dpD.JrJezUtND_abb7FXxj9Wj0ux3ql9&h=c6980913&itok=AUgevh-W\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Solar panels on homes and businesses in Karachi, Pakistan.

Industrial and residential users faced sharp price increases as subsidies were withdrawn. Simultaneously, Pakistan’s economic crisis, high global fuel prices and mandatory fixed costs to maintain underutilized fossil-fuel plants compounded the spiralling costs.</p><p>On the supply side, global solar panel prices fell by nearly 50% due to Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, while Pakistan <a href=\"https://uploads.renewablesfirst.org/The_Great_Solar_Rush_in_Pakistan_38157451a3.pdf\">exempted solar photovoltaic (PV) imports</a> from duties and sales taxes until mid-2025. Together, these factors made rooftop solar systems (also known as distributed solar PV) financially attractive.</p><p>In agriculture, the removal of diesel subsidies further <a href=\"https://paklaweservice.com/updates/PLP-others/PakistanEconomicSurvey2024-25.pdf\">tipped the balance toward solar pumps</a>, while maintaining the grid stability <a href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099062824120620952#:~:text=This%20report%20is%20based%20on,(MTF)%20for%20Energy%20Access.\">made solar appear more dependable than grid</a>.</p><p>The combination of these demand- and supply-side disruptions made solar an infrastructure of necessity. It offered cheaper, more reliable and more immediate energy relief compared to the grid. Pre-existing policies which supported this included the favorable net-metering policy — which subsidized customers to sell power into the grid at a price higher than just the fuel saving; legacy subsidy programs for off-grid solar for rural households and agriculture; and policies for development of utility-scale power plants.</p><p>Between 2019 and 2025, cumulative solar panel imports <a href=\"https://paklaweservice.com/updates/PLP-others/PakistanEconomicSurvey2024-25.pdf\">surpassed Pakistan’s total installed power plant capacity by 2 gigawatts (GW)</a>. Yet only a fraction of this was utility-scale (0.7 GW) and connected to the grid suggesting a paradigm shift in the country’s power sector, with rapid growth of small solar PV systems, the actual scale of which is difficult to estimate.</p><h3>The Early Adopters</h3><p>Pakistan’s residential sector became an important early adopter as it sought more affordable electricity, particularly by households consuming large amounts of electricity. They faced volume-based prices where the last unit of electricity used is priced at a much higher rate than the first unit in an effort to protect energy access for its poorer residents. As tariffs rose steeply, many high-consumption households installed rooftop systems to reduce demand on the grid. In 2020, 10% of consumers were paying unsubsidized tariffs. By 2024, that number decreased to 1%, while those benefiting from net-metering policies <a href=\"https://uploads.renewablesfirst.org/The_Great_Solar_Rush_in_Pakistan_38157451a3.pdf\">rose from 57% to 89%</a>.</p><p>Off-grid households, especially in remote provinces like Balochistan and Sindh, where grid access remains below 70%, have increasingly come to rely on stand-alone PV systems, as well. With an estimated capacity between <a href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099062824120620952#:~:text=This%20report%20is%20based%20on,(MTF)%20for%20Energy%20Access.\">1 GW and 1.7 GW</a>, stand-alone solar home systems are now the most common off-grid electricity source, enabling households in poor and remote areas to access daytime electricity for their basic needs — a service that was until now unavailable to them.</p><p>Farmers, too, were among the earliest movers in the agricultural sector’s shift away from using diesel generators and/or an unreliable power grid. Contributing <a href=\"https://www.pakistangulfeconomist.com/2025/01/14/agriculture-in-pakistan-a-comprehensive-overview/#google_vignette\">roughly 19% of the country’s GDP and employing about 38% of its workforce</a>, the trajectory of the agricultural sector’s shift to using solar  represents one of the least discussed but most transformative changes.</p><p>Of the 1.5 million to 2 million nationwide tube wells (which are pumps that provide groundwater to crops), <a href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099062824120620952#:~:text=This%20report%20is%20based%20on,(MTF)%20for%20Energy%20Access.\">80% relied on imported diesel units unconnected to the grid</a>. As diesel became expensive with the removal of subsidies, solar pumps became much more cost effective. At the same time, the grid was becoming more unreliable, also motivating a shift to solar. As a result, agricultural electricity demand decreased by 34.3% in 2024.</p><p>Estimates by experts suggest that half of the tube wells will switch to solar power, adding 5.6 GW to 7.5 GW of distributed PV capacity — equivalent to 1 million U.S. residential rooftop solar systems. This shift has not only restructured energy in rural Pakistan but also reduced dependence on costly imported diesel.</p><p>Businesses in the industrial sector also embraced renewable systems to hedge against both tariff hikes and frequent electricity supply interruptions. Given that industry was already dependent on expensive backup diesel and gas generators, the removal of subsidies improved the business case for solar adoption in the industrial sector as well. Export-oriented industries, especially textiles, found solar doubly beneficial – lower costs and cleaner electricity for global competitiveness. While solar plus batteries cannot yet ensure full energy independence, it has significantly reduced the strain on the electricity grid, with industrial demand falling from 31,008 GW per hour (GWh) in fiscal year 2023 to <a href=\"https://paklaweservice.com/updates/PLP-others/PakistanEconomicSurvey2024-25.pdf\">27,830 GWh in fiscal year 2024</a>.</p><figure class=\"caption caption-drupal-media  full_width\">\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-full-width\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">    \n                  <source height=\"695\" media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"2000\" />\n              <source height=\"550\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1440\" />\n              <source height=\"450\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"1024\" />\n              <source height=\"338\" media=\"(min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"768\" />\n              <source height=\"300\" media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 500px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"500\" />\n                  <img alt=\"Solar panels in an agricultural field in Pakistan.\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/500x300/s3/2025-10/solar-panels-pakistan-agriculture_0.jpg?VersionId=_I2LWlkXS7GpLbhjpTBRSzpcikKWEWeC&h=c6980913&itok=-6IbCks7\" width=\"500\" />\n\n  \n\n</div>\n      \n  </article>\n\n<figcaption>Solar panels in agricultural fields have become popular in Pakistan as an inexpensive way of generating electricity for solar pumps that irrigate the land. Photo by GreenThumbShots / Shutterstock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Financing, Informal Economies and Community-Built Infrastructures</h3><p>Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Pakistan’s solar transition is its facilitation by a new wave of mostly self-taught solar entrepreneurs who entered the market during the country’s economic decline beginning in 2022. Leveraging informal merchandise networks in rural areas and importing solar panels through wealthy Pakistani trading houses from China, they have created hyperlocal supply chains that extend into Pakistan’s interior lands. Technicians have learned installation and maintenance by doing — circulating knowledge within communities and via YouTube and WhatsApp groups. These people-led efforts built a domestic workforce and created exportable skills, with Pakistani solar technicians now finding opportunities abroad.</p><p>Civil society and non-governmental organizations have also helped facilitate the transition by piloting school solarization or bundling small household systems with microfinance. The dominant pattern, however, is vernacular: infrastructures improvised through neighborhood electricians, local supply chains and community trust. Social proof reinforced this spread — seeing peers succeed (and often reduce their electricity bills to near zero) increased the attractiveness and reduced the risk perception for new adopters.</p><p>Moreover, what began as a solar rush is now evolving into a solar-plus-storage story, as imports of lithium-ion batteries grew in 2024 alongside solar PV imports, despite high taxes and import duties. Alongside 17 GW of solar PV imports in 2024, Pakistan imported an estimated <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/net-metering-reforms-and-grid-challenges-amid-pakistans-solar-rise\">1.25 GWh of lithium-ion batteries</a>. Battery storage allows households and businesses to not just save money during the daytime, but also use stored energy in morning and evening hours to minimize outages and better optimize the electric grid. Though nascent, battery adoption is rising and will soon become another source of income to help stabilize Pakistan’s overall electricity grid.</p><h3>Solar as an Equalizer of Energy Access</h3><p>One of the most profound yet under-acknowledged dimensions of Pakistan’s solar boom is how it’s facilitated energy access after 60 years of trying to do this with subsidized fossil fuels. Instead of just urban areas and industrial clusters, where the grid is centralized, vast swaths of rural Pakistan that were previously unserved by the grid, now has access to low-cost electricity.</p><p>For rural households, stand-alone PV systems mean that access to lighting, connectivity and cooling are no longer contingent on state investment in transmission lines. For schools, solarization is enabling study sessions, functioning fans during heat waves and reliable power for learning — outcomes that directly address decades of infrastructural neglect due to the high costs of importing diesel fuel. Rural health clinics, too, are beginning to operate refrigerators for vaccines and equipment for basic diagnostics, where unreliable electricity made sophisticated electronics unworkable.</p><p>By creating new access opportunities in marginalized communities, solar challenges the entrenched inequities of Pakistan’s energy regime. However, this democratizing potential is still uneven: Households able to afford storage systems or larger arrays benefit more than those limited to small daytime systems. Yet, even within these limits, solar has begun to blur the structural divides between the grid-connected and the energy-poor, offering an incremental correction of historical legacies.</p><h3>Emerging Challenges</h3><p>Despite the staggering rates of adoption, contradictions continue to persist. Distributed solar has reduced grid demand, triggering what analysts describe as a <a href=\"https://ieefa.org/resources/net-metering-reforms-and-grid-challenges-amid-pakistans-solar-rise\">potential utility death spiral</a>. Electric companies, already plagued by 20% transmission losses and endemic theft, now face collapsing revenues as high-paying consumers defect. Pakistan faces a paradox — a surplus of fossil-fuel plants with installed capacity of 46 GW under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor partnership is now underutilized, but the U.S.-dollar denominated debt still has to be repaid. As more high-paying consumers defect, revenues collapse and electricity rates go up due to fixed capacity payments to idle thermal plants, deepening circular debt.</p><p>Policy responses — such as eliminating net-metering programs and imposing a 10% tax on imported panels — are unlikely to reverse the trajectory. Further, as central and provincial policies continue to act at cross-purposes, with provincial authorities promoting agricultural solarization, and the federal government imposing import taxes to stabilise revenues, these contradictions may push more consumers towards off-grid systems, accelerating the fragmentation of the power sector.</p><h3>How Can Pakistan Maintain Its Solar Momentum?</h3><p>Pakistan’s solar transition has demonstrated a definitive shift from technology commercialization to full market acceptance of renewable energy among lower-income communities. It is neither a climate-driven decarbonization nor a state-led green transition, but a counter-infrastructure of necessity that has expanded access at a pace unimaginable through conventional planning. What began as fragmented responses to tariff hikes and unreliable supply, has grown into one of the most striking people-led energy shifts in history.</p><p>While contradictions remain — utilities face revenue collapse and uneven finance access risks deepening divides — the broader trajectory is still transformative. Solar has displaced expensive imported fossil fuels, powered education and health care institutions, and given households and farmers a measure of energy sovereignty long denied by the centralized grid. Equally important, it has fostered new skills, livelihoods and forms of collective learning that extend well beyond energy.</p><p>Momentum is likely to accelerate as cost declines, supply chains improve and storage becomes standard on all new deployments. With localized guidelines, skill investment and recognition of solar PVs role in expanding energy access, Pakistan’s people-led transition can evolve from an infrastructure of necessity into a foundation for resilience, opportunity and social renewal.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Bogotá, D. C., Colombia (September 26, 2025)</strong> — Colombia has submitted its new national climate plan, or Nationally Determined Contribution 3.0 (NDC), committing to limit its emissions in 2035 to a maximum of between 155 and 161 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq). Colombia has also reaffirmed its commitment to reduce black carbon emissions by 6,130 to 8,873 tons by 2035 compared to 2014 emissions, excluding forest fires.</p><p>The country’s new NDC also includes a climate adaptation component aimed at “reducing risk and the socio-economic impacts associated with climate variability and change.” Eight priorities have been defined for this component: biodiversity and ecosystem services; water resources; food security and agricultural production; human health; infrastructure; disaster risk management; cultural heritage; and human settlements.</p><p><em>Note: The Spanish version of this statement is </em><a href=\"https://es.wri.org/noticias/colombia-actualiza-sus-compromisos-climaticos-con-miras-al-2035\"><em>available here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Following is a statement by Carolina Useche, Director of Climate, Economics, and Finance at WRI Colombia:</strong></p><p>“This NDC update sends an encouraging signal of continuity in climate governance in our country.

      "description": "<p>Across the United States, energy rates continue to climb and contribute to energy inequities. Since 2021, the average residential electricity bill increased by $22 per month, adding up to an additional $264 per year, with more price hikes projected through 2030. The rise is largely <a href=\"https://powerlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PowerLines_Utility-Bills-Are-Rising_2025-1.pdf\">driven by inflation, aging grid infrastructure and</a> growing electricity demand from data centers.  A recent analysis by the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/with-americans-facing-utility-bill-increases-this-year-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-threatens-to-drive-costs-even-higher/\">Center for American Progress</a> found that nearly 60 utilities have either raised or are proposing to raise electric and gas rates by a combined $41.9 billion — impacts that could reach over 80 million customers.</p><p>Electricity rate hikes disproportionately impact low-income households. According to the <a href=\"https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/data_update_-_city_energy_burdens_0.pdf\">2024 Policy Brief on City Energy Burdens</a> by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE), one in four low-income households spends more than 15% of their income on energy, far exceeding the 6% threshold that indicates high burden. Black, Latino, Indigenous and immigrant households are disproportionately represented among these families, reflecting the legacy of discriminatory housing policies, inefficient housing stock and limited access to energy efficiency upgrades. The same ACEEE analysis found that nearly 77 million households, or one in every two households, have had to reduce or forego essentials like medicine or food at least once or twice to pay utility bills. </p><p>While low-income communities already face the greatest risk of climate-related impacts such as urban heat, extreme weather events and pollution, they are also being excluded from the decisions that offer potential solutions to the energy affordability crisis, such as clean energy.</p><p>Clean energy can help improve affordability by directly reducing households’ monthly utility bills and providing long-term price stability. While installing solar panels often requires high upfront costs that put it out of reach for historically disadvantaged or low-income households, once the system is installed, it provides families with a cheaper, more reliable and independent energy supply.</p><p>Subscriber-based community solar can also offer similar benefits but with even lower commitment that allows renters to participate. Low- to moderate-income (LMI) solar programs provide key financial support mechanisms, such as grants, rebates, on-bill financing, third-party ownership models and community solar options, that eliminate or reduce upfront payments. By covering or deferring these initial expenses, LMI solar programs provide a pathway for households to reap the long-term benefits of clean energy.</p><p>To avoid unintended obstacles to program uptake and address systemic barriers, successful LMI solar programs are designed together with the communities they aim to serve. Community-based organizations (CBOs) can be a key partner in this process, ensuring that program details such as financing options, outreach and program administration meet the needs of communities as well as thoroughly address the energy burden crisis and expand reliable, affordable and accessible clean energy.<strong>                       </strong></p><h3>The Case for CBO Leadership</h3><p>Locally formed and staffed by residents of nearby communities, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/justice40-community-based-organizations-environmental-justice\">CBOs</a> can take many forms; their missions typically center around religion, food, health care, education, housing, social services and/or community development. Given this local focus, CBOs have a deep understanding of local circumstances that allows them to act as trusted community liaisons: advocating for the community’s specific needs, educating residents on various issues, raising awareness about available resources and ensuring that community voices are heard through town halls, door-to-door outreach and focus groups.</p><p>Throughout May and June, WRI met with 10 environmental and equity-focused CBOs from across the United States to better understand their role in the community and their involvement in programmatic decisions for LMI-focused solar energy programs. From those conversations, we determined that many CBOs possess three key characteristics which make them uniquely qualified to not just champion or facilitate LMI solar programs, but also to inform and design them.</p><p>First, they are deeply trusted in the communities that they serve — their people and work are well-known among community members. Second, they are accessible; they routinely engage with the community in a capacity that makes them approachable and reliable. Lastly, they have a deep understanding of the local context, derived from their own belonging and familiarity with the community that they serve.</p><p>Based on these conversations, plus feedback from a WRI-hosted <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/events/2025/6/advancing-energy-equity-locally-led-solar-how-cbos-are-lighting-path-community-impact\">webinar on CBO-led clean energy programs</a>, and an analysis of LMI-focused solar program case studies, the team identified four persistent barriers that CBOs described as limiting solar adoption by LMI households:</p><ol><li>Homes need repairs first, such as roof repairs or replacements and electrical upgrades.</li><li>For residential rooftop solar, even with the few remaining available financial incentives, installation costs are still too high.</li><li>Program requirements or applications are complex and difficult for residents to navigate.</li><li>There is a disconnect with or distrust of solar developers due to <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/residential-rooftop-solar-complaints-tax-credits-fraud-deceptive-abusive-practices/651774/\">occasional predatory practices and deceptive actors</a>.</li></ol><h3>How CBOs Can Plug in Now</h3><p>How can CBOs solve these barriers by using their unique perspective to serve as a bridge between communities and solar programs? WRI identified seven strategies that CBOs can utilize to promote successful design and implementation of LMI-focused solar energy programs. These strategies range in both levels of effort required and approach, so CBOs of all sizes and capacities can help advance energy equity in their communities.</p><h4>1. Amplify success stories and testimonials to build trust.</h4><p>Solar implementation can have a “ripple effect” thanks to peer modeling. When one neighbor successfully installs solar panels, others are <a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/news/berkeley-lab-study-explores-how-low#:~:text=Low-income%20households%20are%20more,neighbors%20to%20install%20solar%20too\">more likely to follow</a>. CBOs can amplify local success stories and highlight the benefits of solar, building trust and increasing community interest in the technology. </p><h4>2. Raise community awareness of existing solar programs.</h4><p>CBOs are often more trusted messengers than government staff when it comes to community programming. They can provide resources and materials on existing solar programs and ensure that all communities have access to the cost-saving benefits of renewable energy.</p><h4>3. Help co-design programs by tailoring solutions to overcome local barriers.</h4><p>CBOs can engage with grant recipients and <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/SFA-for-CBOs.pdf\">city sustainability teams</a> to make sure that programs center community priorities and are accessible, attractive and relevant for the communities that they support.</p><h4>4. Identify workforce development programs and connect with community members.</h4><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Regional-Summaries-US-Community-Based-Organizations-and-Their-Relationship-to-Solar-Energy-Development.pdf\">strong local workforce</a> helps successfully scale rooftop and community solar projects. CBOs can do more than support the design and facilitation of training programs; more importantly, they can also leverage established relationships to <a href=\"https://www.jff.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/What_Can_CBOs_Teach_Us_About_Achieving_Equity_in_Workforce_Development_122023.pdf\">ensure residents can access career pathways</a> as the clean energy economy evolves.</p><h4>5. Help residents navigate and enroll in various energy assistance programs.</h4><p>Low-income solar programs can require extensive paperwork to apply — including income verification and access to past electricity bills — that serve as a barrier to participation. CBOs can help <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Implementing-Washington-DCs-Solar-for-All-Program.pdf\">streamline this process</a> by providing checklists on what is needed to sign up, as well as by holding in-person Q&A events that work to demystify the application process.</p><h4>6. Join community task forces, working groups and/or advisory committees to discuss barriers and solutions to low-income solar.</h4><p>Because CBOs are often a trusted entity with whom community members can voice concerns and develop solutions, they often have a unique and holistic understanding of the barriers to low-income solar adoption. They can use this knowledge to develop solutions in key community forums, such as task forces, working groups and/or advisory committees.</p><h4>7. Vet solar installers and developers to streamline collaboration and build trust with program participants.</h4><p>Many low-income households may hesitate to adopt solar due to unfamiliarity with and distrust of installers and developers. CBOs can play a critical role in protecting residents from deceptive practices in a variety of ways. By vetting solar vendors and contractors, fostering direct engagement and guiding investors on equitable engagement strategies, CBOs can foster trust between installers and developers and community members. Partnering with government-led group procurement can also help provide assurance to program participants that the contractors are trusted.</p><p>These strategies aim to expand opportunities for CBO involvement in energy equity and LMI solar initiatives. However, many CBOs are already active in solar program design and implementation; across the country, numerous organizations have successfully advanced rooftop solar adoption among LMI households.</p><h3>Replicable Pathways: Templates for Community-Driven Solar Success</h3><h4>Georgia Interfaith Power & Light (GIPL)</h4><p>GIPL supports faith communities in adopting solar energy through its <a href=\"https://gipl.org/solar#:~:text=GIPL%20helps%20faith%20communities%20and%20religious%20schools%20explore,commitment%20to%20being%20better%20stewards%20of%20Sacred%20Earth\">Congregational Solar Program (CSP)</a>, which has been active since 2018. GIPL assists houses of worship by serving as a liaison between congregations, vetted installers and utilities to streamline effective projects. The CSP facilitates solar feasibility studies, reviews proposals with congregations and supports decision-making around financing options — including if and how to utilize power purchase agreements, grants, tax incentives such as <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-pay-clean-energy-tax-credits-us-benefits\">direct pay</a> (authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act) and GIPL’s own solar loan fund.</p><p>Through education, storytelling and media outreach, GIPL raises awareness and inspires other congregations to follow suit. It provides materials such as one-pagers, social media graphics and case studies to build trust and demonstrate the real impact of solar savings. Their approach aims to create a ripple effect: enabling faith communities to become solar adopters, reinvesting some of that savings into local needs and inspiring broader community transformation.</p><p>So far, GIPL has installed 620 kilowatts across 25 projects, offsetting 3,541 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. GIPL is proving that CBOs are not peripheral to clean energy implementation but rather are essential to building a just solar future.</p><p>When asked what advice GIPL would give to other CBOs looking to engage with program administrators and local governments around clean energy, Hannah Shultz, GIPL’s program director, emphasized the need for resource planning and partnership development, specifically establishing relationships with the program administrator, as GIPL did with Georgia BRIGHT, and connecting with pro-bono organizations, such as Lawyers for Good Government. This external support and technical resources were key in establishing and expanding GIPL’s solar assistance program. Many other participants in the June 2025 webinar agreed, with 70% of respondents asserting they needed more one-on-one coaching, formal guidance and toolkits to implement the proposed strategies.</p><h4>Washington, D.C.’s Solar for All Program<strong> </strong></h4><p>In administering <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/wp-content/uploads/Implementing-Washington-DCs-Solar-for-All-Program.pdf\">Washington, D.C.’s Solar for All program</a> since 2016, the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment collaborated closely with CBOs to ensure program success. The locally run program was enabled and funded through the Renewable Portfolio Standard of 2016 and served as a model for the 2022 national program. At the program’s outset, CBOs assisted in generating support and community buy-in for the program, as communities were justifiably hesitant to subscribe to a program that seemed too good to be true. Key supporting activities included writing letters of support for the Solar for All program, which were used to recruit new subscribers, and meeting with community members to share program details through trusted messengers. Throughout the program, CBOs served as crucial connectors between the program administrator and communities to ensure fair treatment of subscribers and achievement of program goals.</p><h4>Michigan's Solar for All Program</h4><p>Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy was one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Solar for All grant awardees which included CBOs as integral in producing an inclusive program that reflected community priorities in its design and implementation. The <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/climate-and-energy/mi-healthy-climate-plan/funding/ggrf/mi-solar\">MI Solar for All program</a> also highlighted the various roles that CBOs played in implementing LMI solar programs. For community solar projects, CBOs may be site hosts and design projects to benefit their communities, such as resilience hubs. Alternatively, CBOs could assist in identifying site hosts for community solar projects. For residential rooftop solar projects, CBOs can play a critical role in engaging community members, raising awareness of the program and advising on program application.</p><p>The MI Solar for All program envisioned its partner CBOs as a key instrument for educating community members about energy efficiency, enabling upgrades, solar and energy storage, as well as how such technologies are helpful in lowering household electricity bills. To build this out, it organized a focus group of CBOs to understand the communities they intend to serve, tailor engagement strategies, address barriers to previous program participation and discuss how best to on-board CBOs as formal, compensated partners.</p><p>Although the MI Solar for All program, which provided free low-cost solar for LMI residents in all 50 states, was formally canceled by the EPA in August 2025, ongoing legal challenges mean its future remains uncertain. City and state leaders, however, can take lessons from the program’s approach.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Solar deployment is a critical part of the solution to rising energy costs, and the path to equitable and affordable clean energy begins at the community level. CBOs bring lived experience, cultural understanding and respect, and deep local trust that cannot be replicated by outside actors. When included as true partners, CBOs can transform solar programs from technical interventions into community-driven solutions that meet families and households' energy needs. Without their leadership, many programs risk reinforcing existing energy inequities instead of dismantling them.</p><p>Policymakers, utilities and program administrators must commit resources, decision-making power and long-term partnerships to ensure CBOs are not only consulted but positioned as co-leaders in clean energy deployment. Funders and advocates can accelerate progress by investing in CBO capacity, offering technical support, and amplifying their success stories to catalyze replication nationwide. Most importantly, communities must be empowered to shape the clean energy future on their own terms.</p><p>To thoroughly address energy insecurity and ensure that the benefits of solar reach those who need them most, we must center equity, trust and community leadership at every stage. The question is not whether community leaders should lead, but how we can remove barriers to their participation and provide clearer entry points into program design, ultimately ensuring all communities will experience the benefits from the clean energy transition.</p>",
