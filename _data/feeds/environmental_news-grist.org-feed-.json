      "description": "Drought, hurricanes, floods and fires are bankrupting cities across America. After flames ripped through Paradise, California in 2018, the town’s redevelopment agency defaulted on some of its obligations. Naples, Florida resorted to selling $11 million in bond to rebuild its pier after Hurricane Ian in 2022. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power had a harder time raising money after massive fires swept the city. Kerr County, Texas is in the midst of raising taxes after devastating floods in July. And the city of Clyde in north Texas missed two debt payments last year during a prolonged dry spell.  \n<br><br>\nEach episode underscores how climate shocks once seen as exceptional are now straining local budgets, but drought may be the most insidious of these threats. Compared to other types of disasters, it often hits everyone in a community, affects large areas, and can last months, if not years. And unlike with its headline-grabbing cousins, drought has a much weaker federal safety net when something does go wrong.",

      "description": "The upheaval from Hurricane Helene was particularly hard on the Southern Appalachian brook trout, a fragile, cold-water native that has endured more than a century of logging, development, and competition from introduced species. Once abundant across the region for which it is named, the fish has lost roughly 80 percent of its range since 1900. Because the animal is so sensitive to pollution and temperature changes, biologists consider it a bellwether for the region’s forests and streams. They find its rapid decline alarming — not only because they care about trout, but because trout can only survive in healthy waterways. Helene’s damage raises the larger question of whether one of Appalachia’s most iconic fish — and the ecologies, economies, and traditions tied to it — can adapt to a rapidly changing climate.",

      "description": "The Amazon rainforest that covers more than 90 percent of Suriname’s landmass allows the South American country to claim itself as “carbon-negative,” meaning that the nation absorbs more greenhouse gases than it emits. As a result, Suriname is one of the few countries that can make an unimpeachable claim to being on the right side of the climate crisis. But all that is about to change.\n<br><br>\nIn 2028, the country’s first offshore oil platform will begin pumping almost a quarter-million barrels of crude each day. In its first year alone, this project from the French oil major TotalEnergies is expected to generate billions of dollars of revenue for the government and billions more in private spending, causing the country’s economy to grow by more than half. \n<br><br>\nUp until now, Suriname’s coveted “carbon-negative” status has been inextricably linked to its underdevelopment. Its slice of the Amazon sequesters more carbon than the country can emit only because its citizens by and large cannot afford the energy-intensive lifestyles that much of the world takes for granted. The average resident earned less than $500 per month in 2024.\n<br><br>\nNow, Suriname’s leaders want to alleviate that poverty without becoming a net source of carbon.",

And because the process of decomposition slows down in these water-saturated, mossy environments, they trap carbon dioxide and keep it out of the atmosphere, slowing the process of climate change.\n<br><br>\nIn northern Canada, the 90-million-acre Hudson Bay peatlands store five times as much carbon per acre as the Amazon rainforest. Indigenous nations call the area “the breathing lands.” Valérie Courtois, executive director of the Indigenous Leadership Initiative, refers to it as the world’s temperature regulator. “It’s like we have a big fridge on top of the planet that is helping keep everything the way that it should be.”\n<br><br>\nBut now, the fridge is hanging open.",

Among the aid that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved was a $2.9 million grant to hire an 11-person disaster case management team to help victims navigate their FEMA applications, find other available resources, and rebuild their homes. The money was supposed to last two years but was on pace to be gone far sooner. \n<br><br>\nOn the afternoon of August 21, the emergency management director at the Vermont Agency of Human Services raised the alarm: The flood recovery project he managed was running out of money faster than he had anticipated.
