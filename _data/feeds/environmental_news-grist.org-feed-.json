      "description": "At COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the governments of Brazil, Italy, Japan, and India spearheaded a new pledge calling for the rapid global expansion of biofuels as a commitment to decarbonizing transportation energy. By Friday, the last official day of the United Nations climate talks, at least 23 countries had signed on to the goal of doubling the world’s biofuel production and use by 2035 — while Brazilian delegates worked “hand in hand with industry groups” to get language backing biofuels into the final summit deal.\n<br /><br />\nMore biofuels means either more intensive agriculture on a smaller share of available cropland, which has its own detrimental environmental effects, or expansion of cropland, and the land-use emissions and ecological consequences that can carry. Moreover, diverting crops like corn and soybeans from dinner plates to fuel tanks doesn’t just spark brutal competition for land and resources, it can also spike food prices and leave the world’s most vulnerable populations with less to eat.",

Even considering how quickly humans are heating the planet, such a change would likely unfold over centuries — that’s how much ice we’re talking about here. But scientists are finding more and more evidence that Antarctica’s ice is in far more peril than previously believed, with many abrupt changes, like the loss of sea ice, reinforcing one another. \n<br><br>\nWe can now add underwater “storms” to the troubles unfolding around the frozen continent. A new paper suggests that vortices are drawing relatively warm waters across the underside of the extension of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, known as the ice shelf, floating on the Southern Ocean, potentially accelerating its destruction.",

In an increasingly chaotic climate, urban agriculture could improve food security, generate clean electricity, reduce local temperatures, provide refuges for pollinators, and improve mental and physical health for urbanites, among other benefits.\n<br><br>\nThese community spaces are an especially potent climate solution, because it’s getting ever harder for people to stay healthy in cities due to the urban heat island effect, in which the built environment absorbs the sun’s energy and releases it throughout the night. Verdant patches reduce temperatures by releasing water vapor — essentially sweating into the neighborhood — and provide shade. And as climate change makes rainfall more extreme, urban gardens help soak up deluges, reducing the risk of flooding.",

      "description": "On Tuesday, the Jamaican agricultural ministry announced a $3 billion plan to help producers rebuild after Hurricane Melissa, and will start distributing seeds this week. It’s a first step in what is sure to be a prolonged recovery process — one that poses serious questions about how to rebuild the Caribbean nation’s food system, specifically at a time where climate change will make storms like Melissa more likely. \n<br><br>\nFarmers and fisheries across the island, many of which were still in the process of rebuilding after 2024’s Hurricane Beryl, sustained tremendous losses to equipment, crops, and livestock. One of the regions hardest hit by Melissa was St. Elizabeth parish, an agricultural hub known as the breadbasket of Jamaica. Floyd Green, the agricultural minister, said this week that over 70,000 farmers and nearly 41,500 hectares of farmland were impacted by the storm. The devastation holds consequences for both farmers’ livelihoods, as well as the nation’s overall food security. Melissa has left tens of thousands in need of immediate food assistance, according to the UNDP. \n<br><br>\nSome aid groups are already looking toward how Jamaicans can rebuild in a way that is appropriate for a different reality. Hurricane Melissa demonstrated that communities are likely to need even better measures to withstand storms made more intense due to global warming.",
