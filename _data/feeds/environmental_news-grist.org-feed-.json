The action comes on the heels of an action earlier this week when hundreds of Indigenous peoples marched into the conference, clashing with security, and pushing their way through metal detectors while calling on negotiators to protect their lands.\n<br><br>\nThe protests have raised questions about the distinction between climate talks and action, and whether this year’s COP will translate into the latter for Indigenous communities who see deforestation and weak land tenure rights as immediate threats to their lives and homes.",

      "description": "Whether it’s on top of a roof or tucked between apartment buildings, the urban garden is a simple yet uniquely powerful tool for solving a slew of environmental and human health problems. In an increasingly chaotic climate, urban agriculture could improve food security, generate clean electricity, reduce local temperatures, provide refuges for pollinators, and improve mental and physical health for urbanites, among other benefits.\n<br><br>\nThese community spaces are an especially potent climate solution, because it’s getting ever harder for people to stay healthy in cities due to the urban heat island effect, in which the built environment absorbs the sun’s energy and releases it throughout the night. Verdant patches reduce temperatures by releasing water vapor — essentially sweating into the neighborhood — and provide shade. And as climate change makes rainfall more extreme, urban gardens help soak up deluges, reducing the risk of flooding.",

      "description": "On Tuesday, the Jamaican agricultural ministry announced a $3 billion plan to help producers rebuild after Hurricane Melissa, and will start distributing seeds this week. It’s a first step in what is sure to be a prolonged recovery process — one that poses serious questions about how to rebuild the Caribbean nation’s food system, specifically at a time where climate change will make storms like Melissa more likely. \n<br><br>\nFarmers and fisheries across the island, many of which were still in the process of rebuilding after 2024’s Hurricane Beryl, sustained tremendous losses to equipment, crops, and livestock. One of the regions hardest hit by Melissa was St. Elizabeth parish, an agricultural hub known as the breadbasket of Jamaica. Floyd Green, the agricultural minister, said this week that over 70,000 farmers and nearly 41,500 hectares of farmland were impacted by the storm. The devastation holds consequences for both farmers’ livelihoods, as well as the nation’s overall food security. Melissa has left tens of thousands in need of immediate food assistance, according to the UNDP. \n<br><br>\nSome aid groups are already looking toward how Jamaicans can rebuild in a way that is appropriate for a different reality. Hurricane Melissa demonstrated that communities are likely to need even better measures to withstand storms made more intense due to global warming.",

Tuna makes up 99.5 percent of the territory’s exports.",

      "description": "One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. \n<br><br>\nResearchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15 to 20 percent more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and Environmental Protection Agency enforcement officers were furloughed.\n<br><br>\nSince the current shutdown began on October 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. “The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees.",
