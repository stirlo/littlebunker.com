      "description": "The recently passed Senate version of President Trump’s megabill delivers a major win for large commodity farms. Despite early efforts from Senator Chuck Grassley to make sure farm safety nets reach small and medium-sized family farms, his amendment was ultimately dropped. \n<br><br>\nThe exclusion of Grassley’s provision is congruent with the Trump administration’s two evident priorities when it comes to agricultural policy: slash federal food and farm funding, leaving small farmers struggling to stay afloat, and shower commodity farmers with multi-billion-dollar bailouts. \n<br><br>\nThe bill’s changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, threatens food security for millions. It also significantly ramps up immigration enforcement, which will have grave implications for farmworkers and the business of producing food.",
