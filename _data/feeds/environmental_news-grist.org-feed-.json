      "description": "Negotiators from more than 170 countries are arriving in Geneva, Switzerland, this week to resume discussions over the United Nations plastics treaty, eight months after they missed their original deadline for finalizing the pact.\n<br><br>\nPlastic now permeates virtually all of the Earth’s landscapes, as well as human organs such as the brain, lungs, testicles, and ovaries. It’s associated with myriad health concerns, and — because it’s made from fossil fuels — it’s a major contributor to climate change. \n<br><br>\nMany delegates, advocacy groups, and U.N. officials are hopeful that the 10-day session, running from Tuesday through August 14, will result in a final agreement that delivers on the U.N.’s objective to “end plastic pollution.” But progress has been slow at each of the five preceding sessions, in large part due to a consensus-based decision-making structure that has allowed oil-producing countries to obstruct progress.\n<br><br>\nIf negotiators leave Geneva without an agreement, the next official opportunity for them to engage in plastics treaty diplomacy will likely be at the U.N. Environment Assembly’s next convening in Nairobi, Kenya, in December. That forum allows voting — a double-edged sword.",

      "description": "The United States is home to millions of small businesses that form the backbone of countless communities. Even during the best of times keeping shops solvent can be a struggle, but when climate-driven disasters strike the impact on mom and pops can be particularly devastating — and prolonged.\n<br><br>\nThat was certainly the case in Asheville, a city known for its artists, breweries and boutiques. Hurricane Helene not only destroyed homes and upended lives, it sent the region’s economy into a tailspin. According to Kyle McCurry, the director of public relations for Explore Asheville, visitors to the area spent $2.9 billion in 2023. The storm led to a 20 to 40 percent drop in annual business revenue.\n<br><br>\nThese waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term. While FEMA has individual and public assistance programs, there is little if any funding for businesses. The SBA often offers low-interest loans, but the paperwork can be burdensome and the money might not start arriving for months. \n<br><br>\nOne expert says that these avenues don’t usually address one of the toughest challenges facing businesses after a storm: liquidity. Even a month or two of disrupted cash flow can devastate some operations.",

      "description": "Even as President Donald Trump continued upending how the country’s natural resources are managed, he signed an executive order vowing to “Make America Beautiful Again.” His directive, issued July 3, called for balancing environmental stewardship with economic growth, and established a commission to “advise and assist the President regarding how best to responsibly conserve America’s national treasures and natural resources.” It is unclear what policies this commission might develop or how much authority it will hold. \n<br><br>\nBenji Backer, a 27-year-old conservative conservationist, hopes to influence some of those details. He has built a national platform around the idea that caring about the environment and climate change is a bipartisan issue. \n<br><br>\nShortly after the president took office Backer delivered a draft order to the White House containing a list of policy goals he’d developed in consultation with groups like Ducks Unlimited and the National Wildlife Federation. These included goals like restoring forests and combating plastic pollution. \n<br><br>\nThough the Trump administration’s revisions substantially altered the order, Backer was quick to celebrate it. Lobbying efforts by the American Conservation Coalition and its advocacy arm have also met mixed success with the Trump administration.",

      "description": "On June 17, the Department of Agriculture announced the end of $148.6 million in funding awarded by the Biden administration to projects geared toward DEI. The move appeared in lockstep with President Donald Trump’s priorities. The notice itself, for example, was titled “Secretary Rollins Takes Bold Action to Put American Farmers First, Cuts Millions in Woke DEI Funding.” \n<br><br>\nIt all seemed like standard fare under the new administration — except that the USDA neither specified what awards it was scrubbing, nor did it follow the news with direct notifications to those grantees affected. And more than a month later, no one yet seems to know whether, or to what extent, the $148 million in grants has actually been cancelled. \n<br><br>\nThe federal agency’s silence has prompted urgent calls for transparency from some members of Congress. According to a former senior USDA official, who spoke to Grist on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the precedents of how the agency chooses to operate — and communicate — are changing so quickly and radically that it’s creating an environment of fear for the nation’s farmers and ranchers who could rely on federal government funds before Trump took office.",

      "description": "Over the last six months, Americans have been inundated with a near-constant stream of announcements from the federal government — programs shuttered, funding cut, jobs eliminated, and regulations gutted. President Donald Trump and his administration are executing a systematic dismantling of the environmental, economic, and scientific systems that underpin our society. The onslaught can feel overwhelming, opaque, or sometimes even distant, but these policies will have real effects on Americans’ daily lives.\n<br><br>\nIn its new guide, Grist examines the impact these changes could have, and are already having, on the things you do every day. Flipping on your lights. Turning on your faucet. Paying household bills. Visiting a park. Checking the weather forecast. Feeding your family.\n<br><br>\nThe decisions have left communities less safe from pollution, more vulnerable to climate disasters, and facing increasingly expensive energy bills, among other changes.",

      "description": "Economists like to say that demand for coffee is relatively inelastic — drinkers are so attached to their daily caffeine fix that they keep buying it even when prices increase. As the Trump administration mounts its retaliatory trade agenda, that theory will be put to the test.\n<br><br>\nCoffee growers, as well as the roasters and sellers that purchase them in the U.S., are now facing unforeseen geopolitical and economic challenges. Should Trump’s threatened tariffs go into effect next month, it will likely hurt consumers, as many businesses will pass on the costs by raising prices. But it could also have ripple effects on coffee farms, as companies may cut costs by pulling back on investments in environmentally-conscientious practices like organic or regenerative agriculture.\n<br><br>\nEven if the tariffs do not go into effect in August, the ongoing economic uncertainty will likely impact coffee growers in Brazil, which provided 35 percent of America’s unroasted coffee supply as of 2023.",
