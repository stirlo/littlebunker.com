      "description": "At a White House roundtable last Monday, president Donald Trump, alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and a handful of other leaders in the government, announced a $12 billion farm aid program intended to offset the economic blowback that U.S. farmers have faced this year as a result of the president’s volatile trade policies. \n<br /><br />\nThe move is par for the course from the administration, which has allocated a near-record total of $40 billion in farm subsidies this year, with at least two-thirds of those payments having gone to commodity farms. But Trump’s latest billion-dollar bailout does much more than funnel even more cash into Big Ag, which accounts for a significant share of the roughly 10 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions released by agricultural activities nationwide. \n<br /><br />\nThe corporate handout is also adding kindling to a feud brewing within factions of the right wing in American politics.",

      "description": "The COP30 climate conference in Belém, billed as the “Indigenous COP,” was defined by the organized presence of Indigenous activists, who staged protests and demanded inclusion in negotiations. Their advocacy led to tangible successes, notably Brazil’s promise to demarcate more Indigenous lands and the U.N.’s formal recognition of Indigenous rights, including Free, Prior, and Informed Consent, in the Just Transition Work Programme.\n<br /><br />\nDespite these gains, Indigenous advocates were profoundly disappointed by the ultimate failure of U.N. member states to commit to a specific plan to stop relying on fossil fuels, with oil-rich nations watering down the final text. Leaders affirmed that the crucial fight for climate justice and land rights will continue through grassroots resistance, legal action, and future international forums, extending beyond the U.N. conference halls.",

      "description": "According to the latest data, electric vehicle dealers sold about 20 percent fewer used electric cars in October than in September and saw a 50 percent drop for new ones. The question now is whether this dip is a sign of a prolonged slump or a mere blip in an otherwise upward trajectory. \n<br><br>\nWhile only time will tell, many analysts believe that electric vehicle adoption in the United States will continue to grow — albeit maybe not at the same pace seen before Congress killed the credits and automakers started second-guessing themselves. \n<br><br>\nEliminating the federal credit of $7,500 on new EVs and $4,500 on used ones is certainly taking a toll. But the price of batteries, and thus cars, also continues to come down, and used models are becoming more of a bargain. Additionally, some states are trying to step in to fill the void the federal government has left.",
