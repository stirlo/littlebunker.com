      "description": "For several years now, heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces in the United States. Instead of burning fossil fuels to generate warmth, these appliances use electricity — ideally provided by renewable sources like wind and solar — to transfer heat from even frigid outdoor air into a home. Many states have recognized the power of these highly efficient devices for both reducing emissions and keeping people from burning toxic natural gas in their homes: In 2023, Maine hit its goal of installing 100,000 of them two years ahead of schedule, then went ahead and pledged to install 175,000 more by 2027.\n<br><br>\nNow, attention is turning toward industries that burn fossil fuels in boilers to process food, textiles, and a bevy of other goods. In addition to producing almost a quarter of the nation’s directly emitted greenhouse gases, the manufacturing sector loads the atmosphere with toxicants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and PM 2.5, which all cause extensive and severe health problems across the country.\n<br><br>\nThe solution is the humble heat pump, albeit much larger versions than you’d get for your home. A new report from the American Lung Association finds that replacing 33,500 conventional, combustion-based boilers nationwide with this electric alternative could avoid 77,200 premature deaths, 33 million asthma attacks, and more than 200,000 new asthma cases by 2050. It would also save $1.1 trillion in health costs in that period, and prevent $351 billion in climate damages.",

      "description": "About a billion years ago, the United States was nearly ripped in half. Magma bubbled up as the Earth’s crust stretched thin somewhere around Michigan, nearly creating a new sea. Evidence of that scar, called the Midcontinent Rift, now curls around the upper Midwest, stretching from Ontario all the way down to Wichita, Kansas. Today, it’s the deepest failed rift in the world — and a 1,200-mile mining hotspot, known for its stores of copper and nickel.\n<br><br>\nResearchers believe the area may also be home to large hydrogen deposits. They are starting to think that places like the Midcontinent Rift can provide the world with enough naturally-occurring hydrogen to decarbonize the technologies that rely on the element.\n<br><br>\nThat matters because, even though hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it’s also one of the most difficult to capture in its pure form.",

      "description": "On Georgia’s Wassaw Island beach near Savannah, volunteers with the Caretta Research Project dig into sea turtle nests to count eggshells, assess hatch success, and gather data on hatchlings and nesting mothers. Their work, part of a decades-long coastal monitoring effort from Florida to Virginia, tracks population trends, genetic diversity, and the impacts of climate change. Rising seas, for instance, threaten nesting beaches, while warmer sand may skew sex ratios toward females. \n<br><br>\nSea turtles take around 30 years to reach sexual maturity. Hatchlings that crawl to the ocean today won’t be back until the 2050s. Although researchers can’t draw conclusions from their current data, it will be critical decades from now.",

It also includes boons for oil drilling and exploration, and increases demand for timber from national forests. White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers told Grist that its policies will “turbocharge energy production” and “deliver further relief to American families and businesses.” \n<br><br>\nBut one month since its signing, the Republican megabill seems to be doing the opposite. Program administrators, energy experts, and tribal leaders across the country said there is chaos and confusion as they wait to hear the fate of IRA-funded programs worth billions of dollars.\n<br><br>\nGrist reports from four locations on how local groups are wading through the cuts and uncertainty.",
