      "description": "In July 2024, Vermont was hit by 100-year flooding for the second summer in a row. Among the aid that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, approved was a $2.9 million grant to hire an 11-person disaster case management team to help victims navigate their FEMA applications, find other available resources, and rebuild their homes. The money was supposed to last two years, but was on pace to be gone far sooner. \n<br><br>\nOn the afternoon of August 21, the emergency management director at the Vermont Agency of Human Services raised the alarm: the flood recovery project he managed was running out of money faster than he had anticipated. The corporate contractor Vermont used to hire the team, he calculated, was actually billing nearly half of the budget for its own staff.",

Inside, operators wage war against inclement weather and power surges, ensuring that electricity is reliably delivered to 65 million customers across 13 states and the District of Columbia. \n<br><br>\nAs the U.S. grapples with a surge in electricity demand, however, that may be changing. Governors from 11 of PJM’s member states have banded together to demand a greater role in the grid’s energy decisions, given rapidly rising costs faced by their constituents. Some even threatened to walk away from the 13-state grid altogether.",

      "description": "When residents of a small farming community southeast of Ann Arbor learned that a data center was proposed for an 822-acre property largely in their town, they responded by quickly forming a new residents group in opposition, and began collecting ballot initiative signatures to put a rezoning for the data center in front of Augusta Township voters.\n<br><br>\nTownship leadership fully supported the data center. The debate consumed local politics and bitterly divided some residents in this town of about 8,000 people, leading to accusations of harassment and threats. But the grassroots effort is part of a growing number of municipal fights that are playing out in towns throughout Michigan—and across the U.S.—that could derail data center plans.",

      "description": "Today, a group of 160 scientists from 23 countries is announcing that the planet has already reached its first major tipping point: the widespread death of warm-water coral reefs. That’s due primarily to rapidly rising marine temperatures — the seas have absorbed 90 percent of the excess heat we’ve created — but also the acidification that comes from more atmospheric CO2 interacting with water. Since the late 1980s, ocean surface warming has quadrupled. Accordingly, in the last half century, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared.",

The goal is to thin, log, and intentionally burn what experts say are unnaturally fire-prone forests. If their work can stay ahead of stand-converting flames, they hope to leave a vast swath of trees resilient to future fires. The project, which targets 285,000 acres of forest, is called Plumas Community Protection, and Congress in 2023 gave the Forest Service $274 million to carry it out.\n<br><br>\nThe plan’s success depends on rapid accomplishment by a bureaucracy seldom known to be nimble, and now in the hands of an administration that has laid off thousands of workers and frozen millions of dollars of federal funds.",

Across the world’s oceans, tiny organisms known as phytoplankton harvest the sun’s energy, gobbling up carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They’re eaten by little animals called zooplankton, which poop out pellets that sink to the seafloor. What is essentially a giant toilet, then, flushes carbon at the surface into the depths, where it stays locked away from the atmosphere, thus keeping the amount of CO2 up there in check.\n<br><br>\nBut worrying signals are flashing that this commode could be changing in profound ways.",
