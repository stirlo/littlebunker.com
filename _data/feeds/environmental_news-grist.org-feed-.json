      "description": "Two recent studies show how rising temperatures have already made—and could keep making—agricultural production less efficient, underscoring the tough position farmers and consumers face.\n<br><br>\nAgricultural production both drives climate change and suffers from its effects. Adapting to any growing season challenges comes at a cost, and farmers must continually weigh the financial benefits of adopting new techniques. For example, corn is highly sensitive to extreme heat. One option for U.S. Midwest farmers is to plant fast-maturing corn varietals. However, these often yield less overall, reducing the amount of corn farmers can sell compared to cooler growing seasons.\n<br><br>\nRising temperatures will also impact producers unevenly. In a high-warming climate scenario, U.S. corn farmers could see yield losses of 40 to 50 percent by the end of the century. In contrast, rice farmers in South and Southeast Asia may experience increased yields over the same period.\n<br><br>\nThe studies include important caveats, such as the potential for future technologies—like gene editing—to make crops more resilient, and how farmers might adapt their practices in response to a warming world.",

      "description": "Solar farms are increasingly being built on agricultural land to meet rising demand for renewable energy, with the American Farmland Trust projecting that 80% of the necessary solar acreage could be used from farmland. This trend has sparked opposition from local activists, state legislatures, and, during the Trump administration, the White House, over concerns about the loss of vital agricultural land. \n<br><br>\nBut supporters highlight projects like one in Lee County, Georgia, where sheep graze beneath solar panels and beehives thrive. This integrated approach challenges assumptions that solar farms eliminate farming, showing how land can serve dual purposes. In Georgia, farmland typically receives a property tax break, but land converted to solar is taxed at full value, boosting county revenues. \n<br><br>\nStill, there’s been pushback to solar on farmland. A bill in Georgia’s legislature this year would have removed the farmland tax break for an entire farm if it adds solar — even when the solar is only on part of the land. That measure passed the Georgia House but not the Senate and could still return next year. Other states, including Ohio and Missouri, have also pursued limits on solar farm development.",

      "description": "The federal Weatherization Assistance Program is the oldest and largest energy efficiency initiative in American history. Born from the 1973 oil crisis, it helps low and moderate income households make a litany of upgrades to their homes, such as installing insulation, sealing windows, and wrapping water pipes. \n<br><br>\nThe program, known as WAP, is often free and saves residents an average of $372 annually on their utility bills. The Department of Energy, which administers the $326 million WAP budget, works with local companies to weatherize qualifying homes. \n<br><br>\nBut a report, released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, found that many homes need basic — but expensive — repairs before they can participate, something many residents can’t afford. Those households are placed on a deferral list until those improvements are made. \n<br><br>\nACEEE surveyed providers in 28 states about their deferrals. The top reason cited was the poor condition of the roof — an issue that undermines improvements such as attic insulation. Floor damage and outdated electric panels were the other leading justifications for deferring homes. \n<br><br>\nThe average cost of bringing a home up to WAP standards, the report found, was nearly $14,000.",

      "description": "The Trump administration announced plans last month to reorganize the Environmental Protection Agency and cut staff back to levels last seen in the Reagan era. The EPA’s proposed budget for 2026 would halve its funding, from $9.14 billion to $4.16 billion. \n<br><br>\nAlong with proposed cuts to grants for state and local air quality management and pollution control, the EPA is planning to restructure how it regulates air quality, dismantling two offices charged with regulating air and climate pollution. \n<br><br>\nOverall, air quality in the U.S. has improved in the decades since the 1970 Clean Air Act began more strictly regulating industrial pollution. That progress has been curtailed as wildfire smoke has become more prevalent. Even one bad season can put the health of communities at risk, with Indigenous nations and communities of color disproportionally affected. \n<br><br>\nAs the EPA seeks to cut jobs, some worry there won’t be the staff — or the institutional expertise — to process and distribute data even if air quality monitors continue to collect readings. And as the EPA guts environmental regulations, it may be harder for scientists to properly assess impacts to public health. \n<br><br>\nCanadian scientists are also worried that the fires are burning across soils heavily polluted by mining operations, so the smoke could be laced with toxicants like arsenic and lead.",

However, these chemicals have been linked to numerous human health problems, including reproductive issues, high cholesterol, and certain cancers.\n<br><br>\nIn response, soybean farmers have positioned their crop as an unexpected solution to PFAS-based firefighting foams. While further research and development are needed to confirm that a soy-based, PFAS-free foam can perform reliably under extreme conditions, it is catching the attention of local fire departments. \n<br><br>\nThis product is not alone. Other alternative firefighting foams are also on the market. Some are bio-based—such as a gel made with canola oil, while others aim to mimic the fire-suppressing qualities of PFAS without using fluorinated compounds.",
