      "description": "About a billion years ago, the United States was nearly ripped in half. Magma bubbled up as the Earth’s crust stretched thin somewhere around Michigan, nearly creating a new sea. Evidence of that scar, called the Midcontinent Rift, now curls around the upper Midwest, stretching from Ontario all the way down to Wichita, Kansas. Today, it’s the deepest failed rift in the world — and a 1,200-mile mining hotspot, known for its stores of copper and nickel.\n<br><br>\nResearchers believe the area may also be home to large hydrogen deposits. They are starting to think that places like the Midcontinent Rift can provide the world with enough naturally-occurring hydrogen to decarbonize the technologies that rely on the element.\n<br><br>\nThat matters because, even though hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it’s also one of the most difficult to capture in its pure form.",

Their work, part of a decades-long coastal monitoring effort from Florida to Virginia, tracks population trends, genetic diversity, and the impacts of climate change. Rising seas, for instance, threaten nesting beaches, while warmer sand may skew sex ratios toward females. \n<br><br>\nSea turtles take around 30 years to reach sexual maturity. Hatchlings that crawl to the ocean today won’t be back until the 2050s. Although researchers can’t draw conclusions from their current data, it will be critical decades from now.",

      "description": "When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, he was in many ways delivering on a campaign promise: gutting the country’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. \n<br><br>\nThe new budget law delivers deep cuts for programs like renewable energy, tree-planting, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It also includes boons for oil drilling and exploration, and increases demand for timber from national forests. White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers told Grist that its policies will “turbocharge energy production” and “deliver further relief to American families and businesses.” \n<br><br>\nBut one month since its signing, the Republican megabill seems to be doing the opposite. Program administrators, energy experts, and tribal leaders across the country said there is chaos and confusion as they wait to hear the fate of IRA-funded programs worth billions of dollars.\n<br><br>\nGrist reports from four locations on how local groups are wading through the cuts and uncertainty.",

Now, a small number of food banks around the world have recently started tracking their operations and quantifying how many emissions they’re avoiding — with the goal of using that data to better aid decarbonization efforts, as well as to sell  carbon credits. \n<br><br>\nThese carbon credits could help open up new avenues to raise money for food banks at a time when other sources of funding, like foreign aid from wealthy to developing countries, are threatened, according to the Global FoodBanking Network, or GFN. The nonprofit organization has piloted this carbon credit program in Mexico and Ecuador and is working to bring food banks in 12 other countries onboard. \n<br><br>\nHowever, the rollout of GFN’s program for calculating food banks’ carbon footprint raises the question of whether nonprofits with social and environmental missions should make use of these controversial accounting instruments to stay afloat and further their impact.",
