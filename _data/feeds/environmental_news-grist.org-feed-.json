      "description": "Gas-powered leaf blowers aren’t just annoying; they’re bad for public health. Their low-frequency roar can be louder than the World Health Organization’s recommended limit of 55 decibels up to 800 feet away. By one estimate, running a gas-powered leaf blower for an hour emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a car from Los Angeles to Denver.<br><br>\nCities and states across the country have taken different approaches to dealing with the problem, but it is proving more challenging than many expected. Noise complaints are not exactly at the top of police officers’ priority lists, and sometimes ordinances are written in a way that’s hard to carry out — police aren’t usually expected to go around town taking noise readings, for example.\n<br><br>\nThen there’s the matter that swapping gas blowers for ones powered by electricity isn’t as straightforward as it sounds.",

      "description": "A silent epidemic is affecting people who toil in extreme temperatures — from sugarcane cutters in Central America to agricultural workers in South Asia. A 2022 study found that high temperatures combined with physically demanding work are driving a surge in <strong>chronic kidney disease</strong>, which is already one of the world’s fastest-growing killers and on track to become the fifth largest cause of premature death by 2050. Yet, it had remained largely invisible to both the public and policymakers until May of this year, when the World Health Organization passed a landmark resolution recognizing the need to prioritize kidney care — even though simple measures such as frequent breaks and access to drinking water could prevent thousands of deaths.",

      "description": "Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have found that, in 2023, data centers consumed roughly 17 billion gallons of water for their operations in the U.S. alone. But a much, much larger share of data center water-intensity is indirect, a byproduct of the facilities’ enormous appetites for energy. That’s because most power plants themselves require huge amounts of water to operate.<br /><br />This off-site, indirect water consumption amounted to a whopping 211 billion gallons in the Berkeley lab’s 2023 tally — well over 10 times the direct on-site usage. As Silicon Valley continues to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence and demand for data centers grows, these water needs are only going to grow in tandem.<br /><br />However, new research from Cornell University shows that there’s a way to mitigate both the climate <em>and</em> water footprints of these facilities: build them in places with lots of wind and solar energy.",

      "description": "The seemingly small question of where to spend 20 or so minutes topping off a battery reveals the transformation taking hold among fuel retailers. For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel. As EVs reshape mobility, they are among the retailers embracing charging.\n<br><br>\nTheir challenge goes beyond providing power to turning the time drivers spend plugged in into profitable foot traffic. Selling electricity alone won’t pay the bills; the real money lies in selling snacks. Making that work requires reimagining what a pit stop looks and feels like, even as costly infrastructure upgrades and shifting federal policies complicate the transition.",

      "description": "At COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the governments of Brazil, Italy, Japan, and India spearheaded a new pledge calling for the rapid global expansion of biofuels as a commitment to decarbonizing transportation energy. By Friday, the last official day of the United Nations climate talks, at least 23 countries had signed on to the goal of doubling the world’s biofuel production and use by 2035 — while Brazilian delegates worked “hand in hand with industry groups” to get language backing biofuels into the final summit deal.\n<br /><br />\nMore biofuels means either more intensive agriculture on a smaller share of available cropland, which has its own detrimental environmental effects, or expansion of cropland, and the land-use emissions and ecological consequences that can carry. Moreover, diverting crops like corn and soybeans from dinner plates to fuel tanks doesn’t just spark brutal competition for land and resources, it can also spike food prices and leave the world’s most vulnerable populations with less to eat.",

Even considering how quickly humans are heating the planet, such a change would likely unfold over centuries — that’s how much ice we’re talking about here. But scientists are finding more and more evidence that Antarctica’s ice is in far more peril than previously believed, with many abrupt changes, like the loss of sea ice, reinforcing one another. \n<br><br>\nWe can now add underwater “storms” to the troubles unfolding around the frozen continent. A new paper suggests that vortices are drawing relatively warm waters across the underside of the extension of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, known as the ice shelf, floating on the Southern Ocean, potentially accelerating its destruction.",
