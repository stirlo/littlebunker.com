      "description": "20 years ago, New Orleans’ faulty levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina, causing a flood that claimed almost 2,000 lives and inflicted more than $150 billion in economic damage. \n<br><br>\nThe catastrophe was so bad that some doubted the city could continue to exist at all. Rather than just patch up the damage, which would have left one of the country’s most iconic cities exposed to every future storm, the federal government doubled down on flood protection, building a new $14.4 billion levee system that ranks as one of the most sophisticated anywhere in the world. \n<br><br>\nBut for all the success of the new levee system, the future of New Orleans remains uncertain. \n<br><br>\nSea levels around the city are rising by about half an inch every year as climate change warms the oceans and melts glaciers. The city itself is sinking even faster than that, with some sections of the levee system settling by almost 2 inches each year — faster than the rate of change that the Corps projected when it built the system. This elevation change makes the new levee system less effective with each year, requiring constant repairs and expansions. \n<br><br>\nThe Trump administration has already eliminated funding at the Corps and Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, for key resilience projects and levee inspections. While the Corps maintains that the system is working as designed, federal and state cuts could jeopardize its resilience even further.",

      "description": "Like many government agencies, the Department of Agriculture has a fraught history with discrimination and disenfranchisement. Farmers of color and young and beginning producers have long struggled to access capital, in the form of loans and grants, from the agency. \n<br><br>\nSo in 2022, former President Joe Biden’s USDA created the Regional Food Business Centers program using funding from the American Rescue Plan. The program established 12 virtual centers to function as business development resource hubs within rural communities nationwide. The overall goal was to build a more resilient food system.\n<br><br>\nOn July 15, the USDA announced it was shuttering the program, a decision that was met with considerable opposition across food and farming sectors. In the press release, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins criticized the Biden administration for creating the RFBCs “without any long-term way to finance them,” which the release described as a “COVID-era program.”\n<br><br>\nRoughly a week after the USDA announced the end of the RFBCs, Rollins released a memo that again took the agricultural world by storm. The five-page document revealed Rollins’ plan to significantly reorganize the agency.\n<br><br>\nBoth moves are expected to have lasting effects on historically underserved rural communities in particular, where farmers and families are already facing the day-to-day impacts of a shrinking federal workforce in local offices.",

      "description": "For the second time this year, the Trump administration has halted the construction of a massive offshore wind farm being built to power blue states. \n<br><br>\nOn Friday, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind offshore project so the federal government can “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona, a former lobbyist for offshore oil and gas companies, did not specify the nature of those concerns. \n<br><br>\nThe move echoes an April order from the Interior Department that stopped all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project. \n<br><br>\nLast time, the controversial pause lasted just one month but cost the developer nearly $1 billion — and drove the project to the brink of cancellation. This time, with a Trump appointee now at the helm of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, it’s unclear how long this costly work stoppage might last.",

Residents have for weeks lived with vehicles coming and going around the clock, stadium lights illuminating the once-dark nighttime sky, and the facility restricting access to the game they rely upon for food.\n<br><br>\nThat is no longer the case.\n<br><br>\nA federal judge has ordered the U.S. government to stop sending detainees to the facility and begin dismantling it within 60 days. In making her ruling, Judge Kathleen Williams sided with the tribe and environmentalists who argued that state and federal officials violated a federal law that requires an environmental review before proceeding with any federal construction project. The judge’s order also prohibits further construction at the site.\n<br><br>\nTribal leaders hailed the decision, but the issue at the center of the case — the government’s disregard for tribal sovereignty — remains.",

      "description": "In early July, flash floods along the Guadalupe River killed 138 people and caused an estimated $1.1 billion in damage, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in Texas history. \n<br><br>\nA week later, Texas found itself whiplashed into another crisis altogether: a high-stakes battle over voting districts. President Donald Trump publicly demanded that Texas lawmakers redraw congressional maps to carve out five additional U.S. House seats for Republicans. The twin pressures of a devastating natural disaster and Trump’s insistence prompted Governor Greg Abbott to convene a special legislative session. \n<br><br>\nDuring the first special legislative session, which began on July 21, Abbott tasked lawmakers with addressing 18 agenda items, including four related to flood preparedness. In a second special session, lawmakers managed to pass a more narrowly tailored flood relief package through the Texas Senate. \n<br><br>\nDisaster recovery experts said that the measures are too narrowly focused on the most recent disaster. For instance, instead of confronting tougher questions about whether summer camps should be built along rivers prone to flash flooding at all, the proposed Senate Bill 2 simply requires camps in floodplains to adopt evacuation plans, implement them when flash flood alerts are sent, and provide ladders for emergency rooftop access in cabins located within the flood zone.",

      "description": "If you’re struggling to walk more, know that it’s not necessarily a failure of willpower. Planners designed American cities not just to prioritize the car, but to impede the pedestrian — too few sidewalks, fat thoroughfares slicing up neighborhoods, sprawling parking lots instead of parks. Yet study after study outlines the abundant mental and physical health benefits of simply putting one foot in front of the other, especially for older adults and those with disabilities who can’t manage vigorous exercise like running. And that’s to say nothing of the climate benefits of walking more and driving less.\n<br><br>\nWhat is walkability, exactly? Simply put, it’s a measurement of how easily you can get to essential places by foot. If you can do all your daily errands without a car, you’re likely living somewhere with a score between 90 and 100. Between 70 and 89, it’s most of your errands on foot, and between 50 and 69, some of them.",

      "description": "Disaster cleanup is a sprawling, messy business. In the aftermath of hurricanes, wildfires, and the like, a nesting doll of contractors and subcontractors, officials at every level of government, and an alphabet soup of agencies are needed to clear debris and set things right.\n<br><br>\nLocal governments can tackle the job by hiring contractors, working with the state, and having the Federal Emergency Management Agency reimburse the costs. But counties usually hand the work over to the feds. In that case, FEMA coordinates the effort through federal agencies like the Army Corps and pays the firms they hire. The goal is quickly clearing roads, houses, and waterways of everything from windblown branches to the wreckage of homes washed away by the inundation. The scope of this work encompasses anything the agency deems “in the public interest,” a potential hazard, and directly related to a declared disaster. Cleanup on private land can operate through a similar system, or be left to homeowners.\n<br><br>\nBecause contractors are paid by the weight of waste removed or by the linear foot of ground covered, there can be a struggle to balance expediency and ecological care. Compounding the challenge, there is little oversight. The Army Corps of Engineers is supposed to coordinate with wildlife agencies, but government scientists who spoke with Grist say the Corps failed to do so after Helene, and they worry it’s too late to reverse the resulting damage.\n<br><br>\nNo one denies the need to clean up, but the process has sparked arguments about what constitutes debris, what ought to be cleared, and what might be better left alone.",

It was a familiar dodge, but there was at least a kernel of truth to what Abbott was saying. The blame game that erupts after a tragedy can distract from getting things done. These early narratives often outpace evidence, and the conversation quickly devolves into talking points pitting one side against another. \n<br><br>\nTalking about mistakes is essential to finding real solutions — a fact that wasn’t lost on the many football fans, who criticized Abbott’s “loser” remarks. It’s hard to improve if you don’t unpack what went wrong. But people in power can weaponize the public’s distaste for the blame game in order to dodge questions about accountability. Few bother to distinguish between knee-jerk finger pointing and more nuanced, careful examinations of what factors put people in harm’s way. \n<br><br>\nOne expert says that the more thorough assessment doesn’t need to happen immediately, but in the weeks and months that follow a tragedy. For the Texas floods, that means now. And yet our national attention span burns out fast, like a match fueled by hot takes — flaring out long before the hard work of recovery and preparation can begin. \n<br><br>\nIt’s a fundamental mismatch: By the time we finally have the distance and data to learn from what went wrong, it already feels like the moment to act has passed.",
