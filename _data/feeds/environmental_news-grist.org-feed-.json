After 1989’s Hurricane Hugo, for instance, couples in South Carolina counties where a disaster was declared divorced at higher rates than in less-devastated areas. But the data also tells a more complicated story: Marriage and birth rates also climbed in those same hard-hit areas. The researchers suspected that surviving a life-threatening disaster motivated people to reevaluate what’s important to them, sometimes drawing them closer, sometimes pulling them apart.",

It’s designed to both support local producers and bring more fresh, sustainably grown produce to students across California. \n<br><br>\nIt’s also a sign of how some states are continuing efforts to support farmers in the face of mounting federal cuts.",

The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?",

The Inupiaq have long read these ridges and valleys as a living story: Fire and fracture have marked the rock, and glaciers’ slow grind polished it. The talus slopes gleam in the low fall sun, meltwater from the snowfields spilling into streams that thread across the map of caribou trails on the tundra below.\n<br><br>\nHidden beneath these remote valleys lies one of the world’s largest known graphite deposits. Over millions of years, carbon deep within the earth was subjected to immense heat and pressure, forming crystalline sheets black and soft as pencil lead. \n<br><br>\nCanadian company Graphite One plans to mine the valuable material for batteries and strategic minerals — despite many residents’ objections, and so far, without the federally required tribal consultation with the nearby communities of Teller, Brevig Mission, and Mary’s Igloo.",

But the treaty hinges on those almost 200 countries periodically submitting goals outlining just how much they’ll individually cut emissions in the coming years, and then following through.\n<br><br>\nTen years on, however, that ambition is lagging. The vast majority of countries missed a February deadline to submit updated NDCs, and many now appear likely to miss a September deadline, too.\n<br><br>\nEven those commitments that have come in on time don’t appear likely to substantially move the needle on global temperature rise.",

      "description": "Sandy Creek sits among juniper and live oak in the rolling hills of central Texas about 35 miles northwest of Austin. The geography, crisscrossed with narrow, winding roads, contributes to both its beauty and vulnerability when rain comes with fury. The creek has flooded before but nothing like the deluge of July 5 when it rose 15 feet in three hours on the night Abraham Stallins spent defending his home.\n<br><br>\nIn the days and weeks after the floods, Stallins and many neighbors in his community felt ignored by the county government even as it insisted that it was doing everything possible to help. This gap in perception highlights a dilemma facing the thirty percent of Americans who live in unincorporated communities like those along Big Sandy Creek. Without a municipal government to rely on, such enclaves depend on county and state officials whose response may come late, seem invisible, or fall short of expectations. This crisis of trust has followed climate disasters from California to Appalachia and threatens to undermine efforts to prepare for and respond to them. \n<br><br>\nAs catastrophes of the sort seen in central Texas grow more frequent, researchers say narrowing that gap — by preparing communities, strengthening local ties, and ensuring clearer lines of authority — may be just as important as the emergency response itself.",

Sanchez says anywhere else is better than hurricane-prone Florida. “People die almost every year” during hurricane season. I don’t want to be one of them. It’s just really, really stress-inducing. So we’re leaving.”\n<br /><br />\nA year ago, in the immediate aftermath of the storm, <b>Jennifer Rambo, principal of the Spruce Pine Montessori School in North Carolina</b>, was just trying to manage the chaos. “I don’t know how we lived through that,” she said. By the spring, life’s rhythms settled into something like normalcy. Then, a water main burst the week before school let out, and Rambo went back into storm mode. “We were under a boil water advisory and I had to reach into all of the water that we had stored. I was wondering, are these kids going to be traumatized when they see these hand sinks? And they got really excited. They were like, ‘This is just like after the hurricane, it’s so fun.’”",
