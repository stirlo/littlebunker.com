      "description": "Wood pellets, by design, are highly flammable. The small pieces of compressed woody leftovers, like sawdust, are used in everything from home heating to grilling. But their flammable nature has made for dangerous work conditions: Since 2010, at least 52 fires have broken out at the facilities that make wood pellets across the U.S., according to a database of incidents compiled by the Southern Environmental Law Center. \n<br><br>\nOf the 15 largest wood pellet facilities, at least eight have had fires or explosions since 2014, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by a former director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \n<br><br>\nAt the same time, the world’s largest biomass company, Drax, is cutting down trees across North America with a promise to sell them as a replacement to fossil fuels. But even its track record is checkered with accidents. In South Shields, UK, wood pellets destined for a Drax plant spontaneously combusted while in storage at the Port of Tyne, starting a fire that took 40 firefighters 12 hours to extinguish. In Port Allen, Louisiana, a Drax wood pellet  facility burst into flames in November 2021.\n<br><br>\nNow, despite finding itself in the midst of a lawsuit over accidental fire damages, Drax is pressing on with a new business proposal; it involves not just cutting down trees to make wood pellets, but, the company argues, also to help stop wildfires.",

      "description": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, or AMOC for short, comprises an enormous system of currents that carries water and nutrients across the world and plays a large part in stabilizing the global climate. For years, scientists have warned that the AMOC was slowing down, possibly nearing collapse. \n<br><br>\nNew studies published in Nature Geoscience last week and in Nature earlier this year offer some slightly encouraging news. AMOC’s decline could be “much more of a slow, gradual change, rather than an immediate change,” said David Bonan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington who served as the lead author on the Nature Geoscience study. The full collapse of the current might not be reached this century, rather than around the mid-century mark as other research has predicted. \n<br><br>\nPart of what makes AMOC’s behavior so hard to forecast is that consistent monitoring of the current didn’t begin until 2004, so the historical data is limited. When researchers run models to examine AMOC’s behavior in the past, they sometimes get baffling results.",

      "description": "Energy policy analysts are in broad agreement about one consequence of major legislation that Republicans are currently pushing through Congress: It will raise energy prices for the average American household by hundreds of dollars, once all is said and done.\n<br><br>\nThat’s because the legislation, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill, will repeal the vast majority of clean energy provisions contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, which a Democrat-controlled Congress passed in 2022. That earlier law provided a wide array of financial incentives for the deployment of electricity sources like solar, wind, battery storage, and nuclear power, as well as support for consumers looking to buy zero- and low-emissions products like electric vehicles. Choking off support for those measures not only hobbles U.S. efforts to fight climate change, but it also means there are fewer new sources of energy for a country that has started to need more and more of it. And reduced supply coupled with increased demand means higher prices.\n<br><br>\nThat’s the virtually unanimous conclusion of the academics and policy experts who have been trying to understand the likely effects of the rollback for the past few months. Part of the reason for this unanimity is that, once constructed, many newer energy sources like wind and solar don’t have substantial operating costs, compared to traditional power plants that must be continuously supplied with fuel.",

      "description": "Russian shelling has ravaged Ukraine’s forests, turning tree-covered sanctuaries into infernos. Wildfires rage across conflict zones, fueled not just by bombs — but by decades of ecological mismanagement.\n<br><br>\nSince 2022, nearly 5 million acres have burned. Rockets, artillery, and land mines turn drought-dried forests into kindling. Up to 90 percent of wildfires in Ukraine now happen inside or near the front lines — places too dangerous for firefighters to even reach.\n<br><br>\nTrees in Ukraine protect farmland from wind and erosion. But now, wildfires are torching fields, exposing soil, and ruining harvests. The war isn’t just killing forests; it’s also dismantling the systems that feed people.\n<br><br>\nFrom drone teams to AI landmine detection, scientists and nonprofits are racing to save what’s left. Some see a chance to replant smarter, for instance, by swapping flammable pines for native species. But first, they need the world to pay attention, before the forests go silent forever.",

Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.\n<br><br>\n“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It’s critical that we do the work to replace this.”\n<br><br>\nBut it’s expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said. The city’s wastewater woes don’t only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to a former Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency official.\n<br><br>\nIn September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the EPA to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.\n<br><br>\nIn early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.",
