      "description": "PFAS are a class of human-made chemicals known for their ability to repel water and oil—a property that makes them especially effective in extinguishing hard-to-control fires, such as those started with diesel fuel. However, these chemicals have been linked to numerous human health problems, including reproductive issues, high cholesterol, and certain cancers.\n<br><br>\nIn response, soybean farmers have positioned their crop as an unexpected solution to PFAS-based firefighting foams. While further research and development are needed to confirm that a soy-based, PFAS-free foam can perform reliably under extreme conditions, it is catching the attention of local fire departments. \n<br><br>\nThis product is not alone. Other alternative firefighting foams are also on the market. Some are bio-based—such as a gel made with canola oil, while others aim to mimic the fire-suppressing qualities of PFAS without using fluorinated compounds.",

Newcomers to the seemingly endless grasslands that once spanned approximately a quarter of North America often hit a psychic wall, descending into fits of mania. Drought, loneliness, and debt drove many to failure, forcing the homesteaders to retreat East. \n<br><br>\nThose who stayed unwittingly launched one of history’s largest terraforming projects, rewiring the land, the climate, and the future of the continent. Settlers not only forcibly displaced Indigenous nations, but completely altered the region’s ancient carbon and nitrogen cycles. \n<br><br>\nThey also turned the region into an agricultural powerhouse. The deep black soil once prevalent in the Midwest — the result of thousands of years of animal and plant decomposition depositing untold carbon stores into the ground — became the foundation of the modern food system. \n<br><br>\nBut the undoing of the American prairie also dismantled one of Earth’s most effective climate defenses.",

Alaska is warming more than twice as fast as the global average.",

      "description": "On a summer night in 2023, an explosion at one of Louisiana’s biggest petrochemical complexes sent a plume of fire into the sky. More explosions followed as poison gas spewed from damaged tanks at the Dow chemical plant, triggering a shelter-in-place order for anyone within a half mile of the facility, which sprawls across more than 830 acres near Baton Rouge.\n<br><br>\nFor more than a year, a little-known government agency has been investigating the incident. But the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board will likely shut down before completing its probes of the Dow explosion and other such incidents across the country. President Donald Trump’s administration has quietly proposed shutting down the board, an independent federal agency charged with uncovering the causes of large-scale chemical accidents.\n<br><br>\nNear the end of a 1,224-page budget document released with little fanfare on May 30, White House officials said shutting down the agency, commonly called the CSB, will help “move the nation toward fiscal responsibility” as the Trump administration works to “redefine the proper role of the federal government.” The CSB’s $14 million annual budget would be zeroed out for the 2026 fiscal year and its emergency fund of $844,000 would be earmarked for closure-related costs. The process of shutting the agency down is set to begin this year, according to CSB documents.",

      "description": "When Ted Bundy was a child in the 1950s, he hunted for frogs in the nearby swamps in Tacoma, Washington. The young Gary Ridgway, the future Green River Killer, grew up just a few miles north. Both men went on to become prolific serial killers, raping and mutilating dozens of women, starting in the 1970s and ’80s. These types of sociopaths are exceedingly rare, representing less than a tenth of 1 percent of all murderers. Yet in Tacoma, they were surprisingly common — and there were more than just Bundy and Ridgway.\n<br><br>\nIn her new book Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Caroline Fraser maps the rise of serial killers in the Pacific Northwest to the proliferation of lead pollution. In this case, the lead- and arsenic-poisoned plume that flowed from Asarco’s metal smelter northwest of Tacoma, which operated for almost a century and polluted more than 1,000 square miles of the Puget Sound area, the source of the famous “aroma of Tacoma.”",
