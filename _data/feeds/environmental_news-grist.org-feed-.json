      "description": "A year ago, Hurricane Helene drove its way up from the Gulf of Mexico through Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia, devastating areas that have rarely — if ever — endured so powerful a hurricane.\n<br /><br />\nGrist asked Helene survivors in some of the hardest-hit areas one simple question: Did the storm change how you prepare for a disaster?\n<br /><br />\n<b>Kelsey Sanchez of Oldsmar, Florida</b>, has decided to move to St. Louis. Sanchez says anywhere else is better than hurricane-prone Florida. “People die almost every year” during hurricane season. I don’t want to be one of them. It’s just really, really stress-inducing. So we’re leaving.”\n<br /><br />\nA year ago, in the immediate aftermath of the storm, <b>Jennifer Rambo, principal of the Spruce Pine Montessori School in North Carolina</b>, was just trying to manage the chaos. “I don’t know how we lived through that,” she said. By the spring, life’s rhythms settled into something like normalcy. Then, a water main burst the week before school let out, and Rambo went back into storm mode. “We were under a boil water advisory and I had to reach into all of the water that we had stored. I was wondering, are these kids going to be traumatized when they see these hand sinks? And they got really excited. They were like, ‘This is just like after the hurricane, it’s so fun.’”",

      "description": "The Law of the Sea typically refers to international law described in a 1982 United Nations Convention that governs what states can and can’t do in the ocean, and it serves as the basis for modern-day international law governing the ocean. \n<br><br>\nThe U.N. system prioritizes the perspectives and voices of governments that are internationally recognized, which makes it difficult for Indigenous peoples who have lost their lands and political independence to ensure their concerns are considered. \n<br><br>\nWáahlaal Gíidaak, the vice president of the Ocean Conservancy’s Arctic and Northern Waters program, thinks that vacuum leaves opportunity for Indigenous peoples to organize and create their own version of international law that governs the oceans. Gíidaak envisions a more expansive treaty spanning geographies and nationalities that could help Indigenous peoples more effectively organize and advocate around critical ocean issues like climate change and deep-sea mining.",

      "description": "On a dusty, warm day last October, nearly a month after Hurricane Helene tore across the southeastern United States, Donald Trump stood behind a podium in Swannanoa, North Carolina, to pledge funding and support to survivors of the disaster.\n<br><br>\nTrump was present to, among other things, deliver an update on a GoFundMe set up by his presidential campaign for those impacted by Helene. In three short weeks, the drive had raised $7.7 million from the pockets of ordinary Americans, prominent Republican political operatives, and some of the country’s most influential and wealthiest families. \n<br><br>\nIt wasn’t until a few days after money had begun to come in that the crowdfunding effort announced where the contributions were going: Mtn2Sea Ministries, Water Mission, Samaritan’s Purse, and the Clinch Foundation. On October 21, an additional recipient, Sweetwater Mission, was added. Four of the five organizations are faith-based Christian charities. Most of them have close ties to Trump or to prominent supporters of his. \n<br><br>\nA year after Helene, what exactly Trump’s GoFundMe campaign paid for remains unclear. Grist reached out to the recipient organizations asking how much they received, and how it was spent.",

Maybe you check your Ring camera to see a young man in a polo shirt, with a lanyard swinging. You open the door, and he launches into a pitch before you can even register the logo on his badge. “Hi, my name is John, and I’m working on the statewide clean energy initiative. Have you received a notice from your energy company about rate increases in the coming years?” \n<br><br>\nIt may not be immediately apparent, but he’s trying to convince you to buy solar panels. \n<br><br>\nFor homeowners, solar can be an incredible tool for lowering energy costs and contributing to a cleaner energy future, but the process requires careful attention. And that may include a hearty amount of skepticism about claims that door-to-door salespeople make.",

They arrive in waves to ravaged areas ready to respond.\n<br><br>\nFirst in are the personnel trained to navigate the immediate crisis. Emergency managers run local shelters and coordinate on-the-ground response efforts, medics provide urgent medical care for those in need, and police, firefighters, and other public safety workers conduct search and rescue. Next, the skilled tradespeople show up, ready to restore and repair. Crews of utility linemen reconnect downed power lines, wastewater technicians fix damaged sewage infrastructure, and debris removal workers clear blocked roads and waterways.\n<br><br>\nRelief workers representing federal agencies, nonprofits, and humanitarian groups set up services to provide things like shelter, food, and water. And then there are crisis counselors, animal rescue units, hazmat crews, contractors, environmental scientists, and many others.\n<br><br>\nA legion of essential jobs contribute to America’s disaster workforce. Those jobs — and the people who do them — have never been more important.\n<br><br>\nGrist talked with more than a dozen people spread out across the United States who have worked on the ground following catastrophic disasters.

Investors were watching closely to see if Buffett, the company’s 93-year-old CEO, would name Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman, as his successor, and how the company would weather the billions in wildfire lawsuits threatening its energy utilities. Buffett dodged the succession question, but the meeting revealed something just as consequential: the company’s strategy to avoid wildfire liability. \n<br><br>\nTwo months earlier, the Utah legislature had passed a law allowing utilities to charge their own customers to build a fund for future fire damages. The state also has a 2020 law on the books that capped the amount fire victims could sue utilities for damages. Combined, the two laws mean that if homes in Utah burn down due to a power company’s faulty electrical line, the financial damages residents can seek are limited — and they may already have been paying into the fund that covers them. For utilities, the result is reduced costs.\n<br><br>\nAt the shareholder meeting, Abel singled out Utah as “the gold standard” of utility protection — a model he urged other states to adopt. “As we go forward,” he told the crowd, “we need both legislative and regulatory reform.”",
