      "description": "On Tuesday, the Jamaican agricultural ministry announced a $3 billion plan to help producers rebuild after Hurricane Melissa, and will start distributing seeds this week. It’s a first step in what is sure to be a prolonged recovery process — one that poses serious questions about how to rebuild the Caribbean nation’s food system, specifically at a time where climate change will make storms like Melissa more likely. \n<br><br>\nFarmers and fisheries across the island, many of which were still in the process of rebuilding after 2024’s Hurricane Beryl, sustained tremendous losses to equipment, crops, and livestock. One of the regions hardest hit by Melissa was St. Elizabeth parish, an agricultural hub known as the breadbasket of Jamaica. Floyd Green, the agricultural minister, said this week that over 70,000 farmers and nearly 41,500 hectares of farmland were impacted by the storm. The devastation holds consequences for both farmers’ livelihoods, as well as the nation’s overall food security. Melissa has left tens of thousands in need of immediate food assistance, according to the UNDP. \n<br><br>\nSome aid groups are already looking toward how Jamaicans can rebuild in a way that is appropriate for a different reality. Hurricane Melissa demonstrated that communities are likely to need even better measures to withstand storms made more intense due to global warming.",

      "description": "The Trump administration is expanding its deep-sea mining ambitions to the region around the Marianas Trench in the western Pacific, and is nearly doubling the proposed seabed mining area around American Samoa from 18 million areas to 33 million acres, an area bigger than Peru.\n<br /><br />\nThe move disregards unified opposition from Indigenous leaders in American Samoa, who imposed a moratorium on seabed mining last year. “Our fisheries are essential for food security, recreation and the perpetuation of our Samoan culture,” said Nathan Ilaoa, director of American Samoa’s Department of Marine & Wildlife Resources, last week in the Samoa News. Tuna makes up 99.5 percent of the territory’s exports.",

      "description": "One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. \n<br><br>\nResearchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15 to 20 percent more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and Environmental Protection Agency enforcement officers were furloughed.\n<br><br>\nSince the current shutdown began on October 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. “The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees.",

Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.\n<br><br>\nEven if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional.",

It will someday return to the atmosphere. New modeling suggests that this “burp” of heat — the scientists called it that, by the way — could be abrupt.\n<br><br>\nIn a scenario where humanity eventually reduces its greenhouse gas emissions and then goes “net negative,” finding ways to remove those planet-warming pollutants from the atmosphere, global temperatures fall. But suddenly the Southern Ocean belches its accumulated heat, leading to a rate of planetary warming similar to what humanity is causing right now. And the thermal burping would continue for at least a century.",

Approximately 25 percent of Indigenous households are considered food insecure and rely on SNAP as well as the Federal Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, a monthly food package program. \n<br><br>\nDozens of tribes have fallen back on food sovereignty initiatives that have been built over the last 40 years in order to supplement food supplies. From coastal tribes engaged in the restoration of salmon to Plains nations reintroducing bison to the landscape, Indigenous food sovereignty is increasing food security and self-sufficiency for tribes. \n<br><br>\nBut many of those programs have been hard hit by climate change over the last decade.",

They installed a pair of Democrats on this little known, yet powerful, body for the first time in nearly two decades. Further north, Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey handily won after making rising energy prices a centerpiece of their campaigns. The victories came just a few days after The New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency is quietly reconsidering plans to eliminate the popular Energy Star program. \n<br><br>\nTaken together, these developments suggest that energy costs could be moving the political needle in ways that other issues, like climate change, have not. And, with next year’s midterms on the horizon, it’s an issue both political parties will increasingly have to grapple with.",
