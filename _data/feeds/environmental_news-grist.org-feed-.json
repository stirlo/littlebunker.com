      "description": "The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That timeframe has now been cut to as little as a few months.\n<br><br>\nThe good news is that President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs, and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.\n<br><br>\nFor those looking to buy an EV, make home improvements, or pay for solar, Grist did a roundup of when those credits will be going away.",

      "description": "It will take some time for scientists to do proper “attribution” studies for one of the deadliest flood events in modern American history, to say for instance how much extra rain they can blame on climate change. But generally speaking, this disaster has climate change’s marks all over it — a perfect storm of conspiring phenomena, both in the atmosphere and on the ground. \n<br><br>\nThe tragedy in Kerr County actually started hundreds of miles to the southeast, out at sea. As the planet has warmed, the gulf has gotten several degrees Fahrenheit hotter. That’s turned it into a giant puddle of fuel for hurricanes barreling toward the Gulf Coast, since those storms feed on warm seawater. \n<br><br>\nEven when a hurricane isn’t brewing, the gulf is sending more moisture into the atmosphere. Preceding the floods, the amount of moisture above Texas was at or above the all-time record for July, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n<br><br>\nThat meant the system both had the requisite moisture for torrential rainfall, plus the instability that creates the thunderstorms that make that rain fall very quickly. This storm was dumping 2 to 4 inches of rain an hour, and it was moving very slowly, so it essentially stalled over the landscape — a gigantic atmospheric fire hose soaking Central Texas.\n<br><br>\nMaking matters worse, the ground in this part of Texas is loaded with limestone, which doesn’t readily absorb rainwater compared to places with thick layers of soil at the surface. Rainwater rapidly flowed down hills and valleys and gathered in rivers, which is why the Guadalupe rose so fast.",

      "description": "A cool roof is a passive technology that keeps working on its own to significantly reduce temperatures not just in a building, but in the surrounding urban environment. For the flat roof of a commercial building, a simple coat of white paint will do. Manufacturers also make special cool roof shingles that reflect more sunlight. \n<br><br>\nLast month, Atlanta joined a growing number of American cities requiring that new roofs be more reflective. Other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, have also passed cool-roof ordinances, but they often only cover flat roofs. Atlanta’s ordinance covers all roofs, though it only mandates that new ones be made cool — it’s not forcing anyone to rip theirs off if it’s not time to replace.\n<br><br>\nBecause cities set their own building codes, they can regulate roofs regardless of the whims of the Trump administration, which is aggressively rolling back climate policies.",
