      "description": "Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way. That shift is getting a head start in Maryland, where last month the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company partnered with Sunrun, which provides home solar and batteries, and Ford, which makes the electric F-150 Lightning, to activate the nation’s first residential V2G pilot project. \n<br><br>\nTo understand how this works, think of EVs less like vehicles, and more like immense batteries on wheels.",

It’s a rule that President Trump intuitively understands, and a driving force behind his linguistic prescriptions. “I have a little standing order in the White House — never use the word ‘coal,’ only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal.’” Trump said in his speech to the U.N.<br><br>“Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

      "description": "In July 2024, Vermont was hit by 100-year flooding for the second summer in a row. Among the aid that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved was a $2.9 million grant to hire an 11-person disaster case management team to help victims navigate their FEMA applications, find other available resources, and rebuild their homes. The money was supposed to last two years but was on pace to be gone far sooner. \n<br><br>\nOn the afternoon of August 21, the emergency management director at the Vermont Agency of Human Services raised the alarm: The flood recovery project he managed was running out of money faster than he had anticipated. The corporate contractor Vermont used to hire the team, he calculated, was actually billing nearly half of the budget for its own staff.",

Governors from 11 of PJM’s member states have banded together to demand a greater role in the grid’s energy decisions, given rapidly rising costs faced by their constituents. Some even threatened to walk away from the 13-state grid altogether.",

The debate consumed local politics and bitterly divided some residents in this town of about 8,000 people, leading to accusations of harassment and threats. But the grassroots effort is part of a growing number of municipal fights that are playing out in towns throughout Michigan—and across the U.S.—that could derail data center plans.",

That’s due primarily to rapidly rising marine temperatures — the seas have absorbed 90 percent of the excess heat we’ve created — but also the acidification that comes from more atmospheric CO2 interacting with water. Since the late 1980s, ocean surface warming has quadrupled. Accordingly, in the last half century, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared.",

If their work can stay ahead of stand-converting flames, they hope to leave a vast swath of trees resilient to future fires. The project, which targets 285,000 acres of forest, is called Plumas Community Protection, and Congress in 2023 gave the Forest Service $274 million to carry it out.\n<br><br>\nThe plan’s success depends on rapid accomplishment by a bureaucracy seldom known to be nimble, and now in the hands of an administration that has laid off thousands of workers and frozen millions of dollars of federal funds.",
