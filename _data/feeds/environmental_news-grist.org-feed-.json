      "description": "A cool roof is a passive technology that keeps working on its own to significantly reduce temperatures not just in a building, but in the surrounding urban environment. For the flat roof of a commercial building, a simple coat of white paint will do. Manufacturers also make special cool roof shingles that reflect more sunlight. \n<br><br>\nLast month, Atlanta joined a growing number of American cities requiring that new roofs be more reflective. Other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, have also passed cool-roof ordinances, but they often only cover flat roofs. Atlanta’s ordinance covers all roofs, though it only mandates that new ones be made cool — it’s not forcing anyone to rip theirs off if it’s not time to replace.\n<br><br>\nBecause cities set their own building codes, they can regulate roofs regardless of the whims of the Trump administration, which is aggressively rolling back climate policies.",
