      "description": "Plumas National Forest officials have launched a plan for a dramatic change in forest management. To mount it, they are using chain saws, drip torches, and an array of gigantic machines that include masticators, feller bunchers, grapples, and hot saws. The goal is to thin, log, and intentionally burn what experts say are unnaturally fire-prone forests. If their work can stay ahead of stand-converting flames, they hope to leave a vast swath of trees resilient to future fires. The project, which targets 285,000 acres of forest, is called Plumas Community Protection, and Congress in 2023 gave the Forest Service $274 million to carry it out.\n<br><br>\nThe plan’s success depends on rapid accomplishment by a bureaucracy seldom known to be nimble, and now in the hands of an administration that has laid off thousands of workers and frozen millions of dollars of federal funds.",

      "description": "The planet would be a whole lot hotter if it weren’t for fecal pellets. Across the world’s oceans, tiny organisms known as phytoplankton harvest the sun’s energy, gobbling up carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They’re eaten by little animals called zooplankton, which poop out pellets that sink to the seafloor. What is essentially a giant toilet, then, flushes carbon at the surface into the depths, where it stays locked away from the atmosphere, thus keeping the amount of CO2 up there in check.\n<br><br>\nBut worrying signals are flashing that this commode could be changing in profound ways.",

After 1989’s Hurricane Hugo, for instance, couples in South Carolina counties where a disaster was declared divorced at higher rates than in less-devastated areas. But the data also tells a more complicated story: Marriage and birth rates also climbed in those same hard-hit areas. The researchers suspected that surviving a life-threatening disaster motivated people to reevaluate what’s important to them, sometimes drawing them closer, sometimes pulling them apart.",

The talus slopes gleam in the low fall sun, meltwater from the snowfields spilling into streams that thread across the map of caribou trails on the tundra below.\n<br><br>\nHidden beneath these remote valleys lies one of the world’s largest known graphite deposits. Over millions of years, carbon deep within the earth was subjected to immense heat and pressure, forming crystalline sheets black and soft as pencil lead. \n<br><br>\nCanadian company Graphite One plans to mine the valuable material for batteries and strategic minerals — despite many residents’ objections, and so far, without the federally required tribal consultation with the nearby communities of Teller, Brevig Mission, and Mary’s Igloo.",

The vast majority of countries missed a February deadline to submit updated NDCs, and many now appear likely to miss a September deadline, too.\n<br><br>\nEven those commitments that have come in on time don’t appear likely to substantially move the needle on global temperature rise.",

The geography, crisscrossed with narrow, winding roads, contributes to both its beauty and vulnerability when rain comes with fury. The creek has flooded before but nothing like the deluge of July 5 when it rose 15 feet in three hours on the night Abraham Stallins spent defending his home.\n<br><br>\nIn the days and weeks after the floods, Stallins and many neighbors in his community felt ignored by the county government even as it insisted that it was doing everything possible to help. This gap in perception highlights a dilemma facing the thirty percent of Americans who live in unincorporated communities like those along Big Sandy Creek. Without a municipal government to rely on, such enclaves depend on county and state officials whose response may come late, seem invisible, or fall short of expectations. This crisis of trust has followed climate disasters from California to Appalachia and threatens to undermine efforts to prepare for and respond to them. \n<br><br>\nAs catastrophes of the sort seen in central Texas grow more frequent, researchers say narrowing that gap — by preparing communities, strengthening local ties, and ensuring clearer lines of authority — may be just as important as the emergency response itself.",
