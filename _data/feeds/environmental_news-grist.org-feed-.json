      "description": "Under a deal approved Tuesday by the Georgia Public Service Commission, Georgia Power’s rates will remain unchanged for the next three years. However, the agreement excludes certain costs that could still lead to higher bills next year.\n<br /><br />\nGeorgia Power has implemented six rate hikes over the past three years. According to S&P Global, the increases are part of a national trend, with utilities requesting a combined $18.13 billion in rate hikes in 2023. Energy bills vary by state and were higher in 2024 than in 2023, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.\n<br /><br />\nIn 2024, Georgia’s monthly bills averaged between $145 and $165—just above the national average. Atlanta has some of the highest energy burdens in the country, according to Georgia Tech, especially among low-income and Black households — meaning those residents pay a higher percentage of their income for electricity.",

      "description": "After three days of nonstop negotiations on Capitol Hill, the Senate voted 51-50 on Tuesday to pass a policy bill that accomplishes much of President Donald Trump’s first-year agenda. If approved by the House of Representatives and signed by Trump, the legislation will make the deepest cuts to America’s social safety net in decades and unravel the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the country’s only existing federal plan to slow the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. \n<br><br>\nUnder the proposed Senate bill, wind and solar projects that either start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027 would be able to take full advantage of existing tax credits. Under the IRA, those were set to continue in some form until the country achieved substantial emissions reductions. The League of Conservation Voters called the legislation the “most anti-environmental bill of all time.” \n<br><br>\nThe estimated cost of the GOP’s top policy priority — extending tax cuts from 2017 — is more than $4 trillion over 10 years. In order to offset those tax cuts, Senate Republicans sought to slash spending on green energy approved by Democrats during former president Joe Biden’s term, among other programs such as food stamps and Medicaid.",

      "description": "Two recent studies show how rising temperatures have already made—and could keep making—agricultural production less efficient, underscoring the tough position farmers and consumers face.\n<br><br>\nAgricultural production both drives climate change and suffers from its effects. Adapting to any growing season challenges comes at a cost, and farmers must continually weigh the financial benefits of implementing new techniques. For example, corn is highly sensitive to extreme heat. One option for U.S. Midwest farmers is to plant fast-maturing corn varietals. However, these often yield less overall, reducing the amount of corn farmers can sell compared to cooler growing seasons.\n<br><br>\nRising temperatures will also impact producers unevenly. In a high-warming climate scenario, U.S. corn farmers could see yield losses of 40 to 50 percent by the end of the century. In contrast, rice farmers in South and Southeast Asia may experience increased yields over the same period.\n<br><br>\nThe studies include important caveats, such as the potential for future technologies—like gene editing—to make crops more resilient, and how farmers might adapt their practices in response to a warming world.",

      "description": "Solar farms are increasingly being built on agricultural land to meet rising demand for renewable energy, with the American Farmland Trust projecting that 80% of the necessary solar acreage could be used from farmland. This trend has sparked opposition from local activists, state legislatures, and, during the Trump administration, the White House, over concerns about the loss of vital agricultural land. \n<br><br>\nBut supporters highlight projects like one in Lee County, Georgia, where sheep graze beneath solar panels and beehives thrive. This integrated approach challenges assumptions that solar farms eliminate farming, showing how land can serve dual purposes. In Georgia, farmland typically receives a property tax break, but land converted to solar is taxed at full value, boosting county revenues. \n<br><br>\nStill, there’s been pushback to solar on farmland. A bill in Georgia’s legislature this year would have removed the farmland tax break for an entire farm if it adds solar — even when the solar is only on part of the land. That measure passed the Georgia House but not the Senate and could still return next year. Other states, including Ohio and Missouri, have also pursued limits on solar farm development.",

Born from the 1973 oil crisis, it helps low and moderate income households make a litany of upgrades to their homes, such as installing insulation, sealing windows, and wrapping water pipes. \n<br><br>\nThe program, known as WAP, is often free and saves residents an average of $372 annually on their utility bills. The Department of Energy, which administers the $326 million WAP budget, works with local companies to weatherize qualifying homes. \n<br><br>\nBut a report, released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, found that many homes need basic — but expensive — repairs before they can participate, something many residents can’t afford. Those households are placed on a deferral list until those improvements are made. \n<br><br>\nACEEE surveyed providers in 28 states about their deferrals. The top reason cited was the poor condition of the roof — an issue that undermines improvements such as attic insulation. Floor damage and outdated electric panels were the other leading justifications for deferring homes. \n<br><br>\nThe average cost of bringing a home up to WAP standards, the report found, was nearly $14,000.",
