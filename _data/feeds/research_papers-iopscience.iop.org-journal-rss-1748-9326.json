      "description": "Yield gaps present a key opportunity to meet the increasing global food demand. Defined as the difference between actual and attainable crop yields, they can be reduced by expanding irrigation and increasing nutrient inputs—strategies whose land, water, and nutrient requirements have been quantified in previous studies; however, their energy consumption and emissions remain largely unknown. This study quantifies the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with yield gap closure through irrigation and fertilizer management. Our findings indicate that energy consumption for irrigation pumping, and fertilizer production under baseline scenario is 462 TWh and 1884 TWh per year, respectively. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers account for 97%, 2%, and 1% of total fertilizer energy consumption. These activities contribute 552 Mt CO2e annually—154 Mt from irrigation and 398 Mt from fertilizer production. Closing the full yield gap would double annual energy consumption to 4579 TWh with emissions of 1.1 Gt CO2e, equivalent to 3% of global energy consumption and 2% of total GHG emissions in 2020. Although closing 75% or 50% of the yield gap would reduce energy use and GHG emissions, countries such as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and several in Sub-Saharan Africa would still face disproportionate burdens, requiring over 15% of their national energy consumption and more than 5% of their total GHG emissions to achieve the full yield gap closure. These findings reveal pronounced regional disparities in agricultural productivity, energy demands, and environmental trade-offs, underscoring the need for locally tailored strategies to strengthen food system resilience, while also advancing low-carbon energy infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel dependence, and enhancing energy security.",

      "description": "The Brazilian Amazon Forest is experiencing alterations in water fluxes driven by agriculture expansion and climate change, which affect land-atmosphere interactions and precipitation recycling. Evapotranspiration (ET) is central to understand these processes, as it regulates water transport across the Amazon. However, its long-term responses to ongoing climate change and human activities remain poorly understood. This study conducted a multi-scale analysis of ET trends from basin to local scale in the most deforested region of the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a remote sensing-based model (geeSEBAL) from 1990 to 2022 to assess deforestation and climate change effects on ET. Our results indicate that overall ET in the Amazon arc of deforestation has increased by 11% during the dry season despite significant forest removal, largely due to the contribution of intact forests and global warming feedback. While these findings suggest a forest response to a changing climate, they also highlight a critical vulnerability that is exacerbated by the threat of ongoing deforestation. With projected warmer future climate and extended dry seasons, our results emphasize the complex interplay between water recycling and climate change in the world’s largest rainforest, with significant ecological and water security implications.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "In recent years, compound climate and weather extremes have received significant attention due to the heightened threat they pose to the environment, human societies, and the economy. This study investigates the impacts of compound drought-flood (CDF) extremes using data from two widely-used disaster databases: the emergency events database (EM-DAT) and its geocoded disasters (GDIS), along with the DesInventar database. The analysis covers the period from 1960 to 2018, consistent with GDIS’ temporal coverage. CDF events are defined as instances where drought and flood hazards occur concurrently or sequentially, with a flood taking place during a drought period or within four months of its end. Our findings for the global extratropics reveal that the economic losses and the number of affected people resulting from CDF events are up to eight times higher than those ascribed to isolated droughts or floods, with a confidence interval ranging from one to twelve. Similar qualitative results emerge from DesInventar and EM-DAT, albeit with some quantitative differences. Furthermore, impact ratios have increased in more recent decades compared to earlier periods, emphasizing the increasing impacts of the drought-flood compound events. These results highlight the amplified negative impacts when droughts and floods occur concomitantly or sequentially, underscoring the need for targeted policies to address their socioeconomic risks, particularly under changing climatic conditions.",

      "description": "Extreme sea-level events, such as those caused by tropical cyclones (TCs), pose significant risks to coastal areas. However, the current generation of climate models struggles to simulate these events due to coarse resolution. By comparing high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) Community Earth System Model simulations with tide gauge and altimeter data along the US. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) coast, we find that HR better represents both mean dynamic sea level (DSL) and daily mean extreme DSL (EDSL) statistics. In contrast, LR significantly underestimates the strength of EDSL mainly due to its deficiency in simulating strong TCs. Both observations and HR show larger daily mean EDSL on the western Gulf coast than on the eastern side, highlighting the need for HR climate simulations to improve coastal resilience planning.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Due to the range of ecosystem services provided, mangrove restoration is increasing worldwide. Mangrove restoration strategies have typically focused on either passive (i.e. re-establishing tidal regimes suitable for natural mangrove recruitment), or active (planting) restoration approaches. To date, mangrove restoration projects typically consider chronic environmental pressures at a site (e.g. the tide). However, acute or extreme weather events (e.g. waves, floods, droughts, etc) are important drivers of global mangrove loss and are rarely considered in restoration projects. In this study, the mangrove lifecycle ecosystem analysis and forecasting model was used to monitor the temporal and spatial effectiveness of passive and active mangrove restoration projects when exposed to routine tides and wind waves, and extreme weather events like floods, droughts and storm conditions. Passive restoration was the most recommended strategy for mangrove survival and ecosystem services across all tested environmental conditions, except constant wind waves. These outcomes were overcome by the active planting of mangrove saplings with stems tall enough to resist overturning and/or wave breaking forces. Planting was most beneficial when restricted to bed elevations where propagules would naturally recruit and when waves were present. Propagule availability was found to be critical in re-populating sites post climatic events (e.g. storms) and was most effective in ensuring the long-term development of active restoration strategies. Mangrove planting provided immediate returns on ecosystem services post-restoration, before converging with the outputs of passive restoration. This study provides previously missing guidance regarding mangrove restoration for a range of chronic conditions and extreme weather events, highlighting the importance of aligning restoration conditions with the mangrove lifecycle for tailored restoration strategies.",

      "description": "Cropland fragmentation (CLF) studies often overlook bidirectional land transformations. This study reassesses county-level CLF in China (1990–2023) using a 30 m-resolution Landsat-based dataset and a novel Modified Landscape Division Index to capture both cropland gains (transfer-in) and losses (transfer-out). We find pronounced CLF increases in urbanized plains, notably the Huang–Huai–Hai Plain (6.13 × 10−2 y), Northeast China Plain (3.69 × 10−2 y), and Sichuan Basin (4.97 × 10−2 y), driven primarily by urbanization (39.5% contribution to CLF from impervious surfaces). Conversely, cropland gains from forests and grasslands mitigate fragmentation, with forest-to-cropland conversion reducing CLF by 40.3%. Counties with CLF increases due to losses outnumber those with decreases by 5.5 times. Regression analysis reveals strong correlations between area changes and CLF (p < 0.01). These insights are relevant for urbanizing regions globally, such as Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need for policies like zoning regulations and reforestation incentives to balance urban expansion with cropland restoration for sustainable land use and food security.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The year 2023 experienced record-breaking marine heatwaves (MHWs) across the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, contributing to the highest global surface air and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on record. These events were exceptional in intensity, persistence, and spatial extent, reflecting the combined influence of anthropogenic warming, short-term climate modes and complex atmosphere-ocean interactions. This study investigates the large-scale atmospheric drivers behind these extremes using NOAA OISST v2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis datasets. We characterize MHWs from May to August 2023, analyze surface and mid-tropospheric anomalies in pressure, air temperature, wind and air–sea heat flux and apply regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) to study multivariate links between atmospheric variability and MHW characteristics. Our findings show that the Subtropical Atlantic experienced the longest MHW, the Northwest Atlantic the most intense, and the Western Mediterranean the most frequent events. The summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Scandinavian Pattern (SCAN) emerged as key modulators of MHWs. Compound configurations of NAO−/SCAN+ in July-August and NAO+/SCAN− in May-June generated persistent atmospheric ridges and weakened the Azores High, which in turn suppressed winds, altered heat fluxes and mixed layer depths, and promoted stratification—leading to sustained surface warming. The leading RGCCA mode explains more than 40% of the SSTA variability and shows statistically robust correlations (r = 0.81–0.94) between atmospheric drivers and MHW evolution. This multivariate approach demonstrates how teleconnection patterns co-modulate regional MHW dynamics, underscoring the importance of compound atmospheric influences. Our results highlight the utility of RGCCA in diagnosing complex climate extremes and support the integration of large-scale atmospheric indicators into early warning systems and adaptation planning in the face of increased marine heat stress.",

Using the eddy covariance approach, we evaluated the long-term (i.e. 2009–2019) net ecosystem exchange (NEE), associated hydrology, and ecosystem structural changes in a forested wetland in North Carolina, USA. We quantified tree mortality in response to changes in hydrology. The ecosystem shifted from a net C sink (NEE = − 3.68 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) pre-2010 to a net C source (NEE = 0.87 Mg C ha−1yr−1–7.59 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) afterward. We ascribe the ecosystem C loss to increasing tree mortality (i.e. from 1.6% in 2009 to 45.8% in 2019), partly due to relative sea level rise (R2 = 0.62). Tree mortality, and consequent shift of NEE, provide early warning signs of a transition in this ecosystem more than 20 km inland from the coast.",

      "description": "Recent research has investigated spatial variation in temperature-related health risks and regional-level vulnerability. However, although a region has multiple advantages and disadvantages, the intersectionality of these factors has been overlooked. This study assessed spatial variation in heat-mortality associations in South Korea and investigated how regional characteristics intersect and interact to create distinct vulnerability patterns using a novel intersectionality framework. We analyzed the association between heat (defined as daily mean temperature at the 99th percentile) and non-accidental mortality across 229 regions of South Korea during 2011–2020. We conducted two-stage time-series analysis with a distributed lag nonlinear model to investigate heat-mortality associations and their spatial variations at the regional level. We then applied a multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy framework to examine the role of intersectional strata in explaining the spatial variation of heat-related risks. Heat-related mortality risks were spatially heterogeneous. The multiply disadvantaged regions (having a low annual mean temperature, a high proportion of older housing stock, and a low proportion of timely emergency room visits) exhibited the highest heat-related relative risk (RR) of 1.105 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.097, 1,112), while the multiply advantaged regions exhibited the lowest heat-related RR of 1.065 (95% CI: 1.057, 1.072). These intersectional inequalities are primarily driven by additive effects, with minimal contribution from interaction effects. Our findings suggest the need to develop region-specific heat adaptation strategies that address local vulnerability. Employing an intersectional lens provides a more comprehensive understanding of spatial variation in heat-related health risks.",

      "description": "Climate change is reducing the extent of cold aquatic habitats and their unique biodiversity in mountain areas. However, a variety of cold rocky landforms (CRLs) are thermally buffered and feed cold springs (<2 °C) that may represent climate refugia for cold-adapted organisms. These landforms, hitherto overlooked by freshwater research, include rock glaciers, debris-covered glaciers, talus slopes, protalus ramparts, and young moraines. Here, we investigated the warm-season water temperature of 228 springs from clean (ice) glaciers, CRLs, and reference slopes (not sourced by any of these features) in 13 mountain ranges of Europe, South America, and North America. Only springs from glaciers (90%) and CRLs (45%) had average stream temperatures below the thermal optimum for coldwater organisms of 2 °C. Springs fed by CRLs were 3 °C–5 °C (up to 9 °C) colder than those from nearby reference slopes. In general, cold springs were rarer in Mediterranean/semi-arid climates than in temperate and sub-polar climates. Landforms comprising barren and coarse rocky surfaces or ice/rock mix, having a simple or absent soil/vegetation structure, and higher likelihood of permafrost more often supported cold springs. When water temperatures were compared to air temperature, most CRL springs were thermally buffered against warm periods, cumulative heat, and daily temperature fluctuations. With cold conditions maintained in a variety of climates and mountain landscapes, CRL springs in mountains likely have high conservation value. We call for integrated ecological and hydrological research for these ecosystems, aimed at understanding their potential as climate refugia.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Equatorial Asian fires are strongly influenced by teleconnections associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Additionally, fire intensity in this region varies depending on the specific type of El Niño event, namely the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño and the Central Pacific (CP) El Niño. However, their distinct impacts and localized variations remain insufficiently understood. Using both reanalysis and future projection data, we investigated the distinct influences of the EP and CP El Niño, as well as the IOD, on potential fire occurrences. Our results indicate that both types of El Niño significantly enhance fire activity in southern Equatorial Asia, with a stronger impact associated with the EP El Niño, whereas the IOD primarily affects the southwestern and south-central regions. These fire patterns are closely linked to large-scale atmospheric circulation changes, particularly modifications in the Walker and Hadley circulations, which influence regional precipitation and atmospheric subsidence, thereby altering vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture availability. Furthermore, fire-prone conditions in Equatorial Asia are modulated by land-atmosphere coupling, with the EP El Niño and IOD intensifying surface drying and heat stress, while the CP El Niño exhibits a weaker influence. Moreover, we found that the relationships between these three climate variabilities and Equatorial Asian fires are projected to intensify, with the IOD’s influence expanding geographically in the future. Our findings provide a foundation for improving fire prediction and enhancing our understanding of climate-driven fire variability in Equatorial Asia under both historical conditions and future climate scenarios.",

      "description": "East Kalimantan, the designated site for Indonesia’s new capital, faces rising disaster risks due to rapid urban expansion, deforestation, and ecological degradation. These changes increase the likelihood of multiple, co-occurring hazards—posing serious challenges to sustainable development and disaster management. In response, this study developed a multi-hazard probability assessment using a Random forest algorithm, focusing on four major disasters: floods, landslides, forest fires (FFs), and droughts (DTs). By applying hazard-specific environmental variables, empirical threshold values, and bootstrap-based uncertainty analysis, the study produced spatially differentiated risk maps and identified areas with overlapping vulnerabilities. The results show that high-probability zones for floods and landslides are concentrated in the southern and central regions, while FF and DT risks are more prominent in the northern and western areas. Overlapping hazard zones, though relatively small in spatial extent, highlight critical regions where compound disaster risks may arise. These patterns suggest the need for region-specific mitigation strategies that reflect the dominant hazard characteristics in each area. Overall, the study provides baseline spatial information that can inform land-use planning and disaster management. The identification of environmental thresholds and uncertainty ranges supports more transparent and evidence-based decision-making.",

      "description": "Temperature extreme events, associated with major impacts on various socioeconomic sectors, exhibit trends related to global warming and undergo important variability across different timescales. While attention has been given to seasonal and decadal predictions, there is growing interest in exploring the potential for skillful predictions also at interannual timescales. In the current study, we assess the skill of the Community Earth System Model-Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble in predicting temperature extremes, globally and in all calendar seasons, up to two years ahead. This ensemble of 24 month-long hindcasts enables a comprehensive assessment of interannual predictability, since it is initialized quarterly per year. The study evaluates the capability of the prediction system to forecast the number of days in episodes of extreme temperature anomalies, considering such anomalies in all calendar seasons and studying each forecast season independently. In general, significant predictive skill is found over many regions, depending on the calendar season. As expected, the skill is higher in the first forecast season and generally decreases over time. However, notable skill persists in some regions even up to forecast-season seven. Importantly, in certain regions, significant skill remains up to approximately forecast-season four, even after removing the externally forced signal as estimated from the corresponding uninitialized historical simulations. This suggests that in certain areas, internal variability of the coupled ocean–land–atmosphere system contributes to the predictability of temperature extremes even beyond the seasonal timescale. The role of El Niño–Southern Oscillation as a source of predictability is also assessed and is found to contribute significantly, especially for the boreal winter (DJF) and spring (MAM) up to forecast-season four. However, there is evidence that additional sources of predictability may contribute.",

      "description": "Climate-induced rapid changes in the Arctic Ocean, such as decreasing sea ice extent and increasing water temperature, are altering nutrient and light availability, profoundly impacting primary producer growth. However, access to the high-latitude Arctic Ocean is limited, and satellite data are primarily available only during summer, making continuous in-situ data collection challenging. We collected year-round chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration data in high-latitude regions using a mooring system and performed a comparative analysis with reanalysis data. Unlike previous satellite-based studies, which typically rely on surface measurements, we used the annual vertical distribution of Chl-a. These data were applied to the vertically generalized production model to accurately estimate annual primary production. The moored Chl-a concentration data showed that phytoplankton exhibited a typical subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer as sea ice retreated in June. Contrary to the gradually deepening SCM distribution predicted by model-based reanalysis data, the SCM layer persisted for approximately 4 months. This indicates that light and nutrient conditions within the SCM layer remained stable, sustaining continuous phytoplankton growth. Annual primary production, reflecting this vertical distribution of Chl-a concentration, was 6.85 gC m−2 yr−1. This exceeded satellite-based estimates by at least two-fold, highlighting the significant underestimation of primary production by satellite approaches. Estimating primary production while accounting for the vertical distribution of phytoplankton and light is essential for improving ecological models to better understand carbon cycle and food web changes in the Arctic Ocean, with important implications for climate change predictions.",

      "description": "Climate change at high latitudes is expected to increase the cover of woody vegetation across the forest-tundra ecotone. However, there is still uncertainty concerning the nature and magnitude of these changes. In this study, we used open access satellite remote sensing data from ICESat-2 and Landsat to model change in vegetation structure across 183 million hectares of the Canadian forest-tundra ecotone from 1985 to 2021. We used Random Forests models to predict canopy presence and height across six time periods at 30 m spatial resolution. Change between time periods was used to classify nine stable and transitional vegetation types. We used these data to map advance and retreat in the northernmost forest limit and linked change types to disturbance history. Over the study period, the extent of forested area increased by 0.9% and the forest limit warmed by 1.08 °C, receiving 25 mm more annual precipitation. However, large parts of the forest limit remained stable over time despite favorable climate conditions. Our mapping also revealed divergent patterns in forest and shrub expansion across the ecotone, with shrubs exhibiting more widespread and diffuse expansion above the forest limit. Increasing vegetation structure across the ecotone was strongly associated with fire history as 80% of mapped vegetation changes occurred in disturbed areas. The majority of forest growth and new forest expansion occurred in fires that burned over 40 years ago. These findings highlight the importance of disturbance-recovery dynamics in structural vegetation change over decadal time periods.",

      "description": "The Arctic is warming at nearly three times the global average, driving profound shifts in its hydrological cycle. Yet, the impacts of this rapid warming on extreme runoff events—key to ice mass balance, ecosystem dynamics, and global climate feedbacks—remain poorly quantified. Here, we analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of summer extreme runoff across the permanent land ice Arctic area from 1980 to 2020 based on high-resolution regional climate model simulations (MARv3.11). Extreme runoff is defined as summer runoff exceeding the 90th, 95th, or 99th percentile of modeled runoff distributions, consistent with established climate extreme thresholds. We then identify regional hotspots and quantify changes in the fraction of extreme runoff relative to total summer runoff, as well as shifts in its magnitude and drivers. Greenland contributes to most of the land ice Arctic extreme runoff area, accounting for 63% of the total, followed by Baffin (14%) and Ellesmere (8%). Our results reveal a marked intensification of extreme runoff, most notably in the Western Arctic. The fraction of extreme runoff has significantly increased, particularly in Greenland (+46%), Ellesmere (+38%), and Devon (+31%) (1980–2020 vs 2000–2020). In Ellesmere, the spatial extent of extreme runoff has expanded nearly 400%. Overall, the contribution of extreme runoff to total runoff increased by 20%–30% (1980–2020 vs 2000–2020) across the Arctic, with the largest increases in Ellesmere and Devon. A clear West-East gradient is evident, with statistically significant trends in the Western Arctic and more moderate changes in the East. For example, Iceland and Franz Josef Land show only modest increases in the fraction of extreme runoff (+11% and +2%, respectively). These patterns are consistent across multiple thresholds for extreme runoff (90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles) and remain robust after detrending. This intensification of extreme runoff is linked to increases in anticyclonic circulation in the Western Arctic. The results have far-reaching implications, including increased freshwater discharge into the Arctic Ocean and the potential disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.",

      "description": "Manufacturing mergers and acquisitions (M&A) represent a market-driven mechanism for corporate restructuring that facilitates technology transfer, resource reallocation, and the exchange of management knowledge between heterogeneous corporate owners. Unlike complex multi-departmental carbon policies, M&A networks may offer a more manageable pathway for diffusing cleaner production methods across urban systems. This study examines how manufacturing M&A network centrality affects urban carbon emissions using data from 284 Chinese cities (2004–2018). We uncover an inverted U-shaped relationship between M&A network centrality and emissions, indicating that initial network integration increases emissions before deeper connections enable reductions through operational efficiency improvements and the adoption of clean technologies. Using Apple suppliers as an instrumental variable, we establish that M&A network centrality causally reduces carbon emissions. However, unconditional quantile regression reveals striking heterogeneity: emission reductions occur primarily in cities with low to moderate baseline emissions, while high-emission cities show no significant response. The temporal analysis confirms that M&A effects materialize quickly but diminish over time. These findings suggest that for cities with moderate emissions and substantial network integration, facilitating manufacturing M&A offers a cost-effective complement to traditional environmental policies. However, high-emission cities require more direct interventions beyond market-driven restructuring. This evidence highlights the need for tailored policy approaches that harness spontaneous market mechanisms while taking into account both emission contexts and network positions.",

      "description": "In the Anthropocene, soil moisture emerged as a critical tipping component in the stability of Earth’s systems. Within the planetary boundary framework, which defines safe operational limits for human activity to sustain the stability of the Earth system, soil moisture plays an essential role as a core component of the water cycle. It governs key ecohydrological processes, regulates land-atmosphere energy exchange, and supports carbon and water cycling, which are vital for climate resilience and biodiversity. This study explores global, regional, and river basin scale changes in soil moisture, hot spot regions of soil moisture change, and its multifaceted influence across several planetary boundaries, particularly those related to freshwater availability, land-system change, and climate regulation. Reanalysis and remote sensing evidence reveal significant declines in soil moisture across major global river basins, driven by intensifying climate change and land use transformations. These shifts signal increasing pressure from human activities on Earth system resilience and highlight the urgent need to integrate soil moisture into global sustainability assessments. Recognizing soil moisture as a dynamic and interconnected boundary variable is essential for enhancing environmental monitoring, maintaining ecological balance, informing policy interventions, and safeguarding the planet’s life-support systems in an era of accelerating change.",

      "description": "Urban function plays a vital role in shaping environmental outcomes, yet its spatial organization remains underexplored compared to urban form. This study develops a land function connectivity index (LFCI) to quantitatively evaluate how urban land functions are spatially arranged and how they relate to environmental pollution. Using Hangzhou, China, as a case study, we examine the relationship between LFCI and PM2.5 concentrations, a widely used proxy for environmental pollution, through spatial econometric models, including the ordinary least squares, spatial error model and spatial lag model. Our findings reveal significant spatial autocorrelation and a positive relationship between LFCI and PM2.5 concentrations, with spatial heterogeneity between urban and rural areas. Moreover, to capture potential nonlinearities, we incorporate quadratic terms of LFCI in the models and observe an inverted U-shaped relationship in urban areas, where PM2.5 initially increases with LFCI but decreases after surpassing a threshold. This suggests that a well-integrated and compact land use structure may help reduce environmental impacts. In contrast, rural areas exhibit a more linear or U-shaped relationship, indicating a higher sensitivity to development intensity. The findings highlight the need for context-specific planning strategies, advocating for the re-utilization of urban land over rural expansion to improve environmental quality. Overall, this research provides quantitative guidance for the development of targeted land management strategies aimed at strengthening urban resilience and sustainability.",
