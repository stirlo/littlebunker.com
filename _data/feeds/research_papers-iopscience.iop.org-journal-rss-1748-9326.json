      "description": "The Asian summer monsoon (ASM) anticyclone provides an efficient pathway for the upward transport of anthropogenic pollutants into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). However, in-situ measurements of key trace gases in the UTLS remain scarce over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (TP), a core region of the ASM anticyclone. In August 2019, the first AirCore observations over the northern TP were conducted, providing high-resolution vertical profiles of CH4, CO and N2O from the surface up to 22 km. Instrument and campaign details are described. Notably, enhanced concentrations of CH4 and CO were observed at 13–14 km when the observation site was located within the ASM anticyclone, indicating that the primary influence of deep convection occurs at this altitude. Back-trajectory analyses indicate that these enhanced layers originated from northern India, the Bay of Bengal, and southern China. On average, CH4 and CO concentrations inside the anticyclone were 30.2 ppb and 52.5 ppb higher, respectively, than those outside. N2O concentrations remain relatively constant throughout the troposphere but show a sharp decline approximately 2 km above the tropopause, indicating the onset of significant stratospheric influence and a weakening of ASM anticyclone confinement at this altitude. These results demonstrate the capability of the AirCore system to resolve the fine-scale vertical structure of trace gases, offering critical insights into the upward transport of surface pollutants to the UTLS via the TP during the ASM.",

      "description": "Owing to their short runtime compared to Earth system models (ESMs), as well as the difficulty for the latest ESMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to reproduce historical warming and the so-called ‘hot model problem’, constrained reduced-complexity climate models (‘emulators’) are increasingly used to produce global warming projections from emissions scenarios. Emulators are often calibrated on idealised abrupt CO2 quadrupling experiments from CMIP6, particularly the global surface temperature response over time to an imposed radiative forcing. Such CMIP6 experiments tend to be run for 150 years, which is not sufficient to reveal the full equilibrium response to an imposed climate forcing. Here we show that, when longer experiments are available for emulator calibration, the long-term climate warming projections increase, particularly for 2100, by up to 0.70 (0.42–0.93, 25th to 75th percentile) °C in the median under a high emissions scenario; peak global warming in a high overshoot scenario is higher by 0.24 °C (0.14–0.31 °C). Corresponding long-term thermosteric sea level rise (SLR) is consequently higher, by 0.45 (0.22–0.52, 25th to 75th percentile) m in 2500. This result, consistent across calibrations from 17 ESMs, has implications for climate change mitigation strategies, as it is likely that even more stringent emissions reductions would be required to limit long-term warming and SLR than previously thought.",

We geolocate each power project and obtain forecasted physical climate risk exposures at these locations using data from Moody’s ESG Solutions. We measure transition climate risks using the project specific committed CO2 emissions and find a positive correlation between physical and transition climate risks across these projects—which are driven primarily by fossil fuel investments. Coal power plants exhibit the highest level of both physical and transition climate risks. Although hydropower projects tend to have lower carbon emissions, they face the highest flood risk among all fuel types. We find no evidence that the positive relationship between physical and transition climate risks varies by financier country or financing type. These results highlight the need for integrated climate risk assessments in international energy finance and underscore the potential for climate-related liabilities to compound across multiple risk channels.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Afro-Asian summer monsoon (AfroA-SM) provides essential rainfall for billions of people. However, in recent decades, unusually wet conditions have persisted into autumn, creating unprecedented extremes. Using multidecadal observations, reanalysis datasets, and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) simulations, we show that Arctic warming significantly postpones the retreat of the AfroA-SM. This delay shifts the northernmost summer monsoon boundary by 5.6°–12° and accounts for 33%–69% of September precipitation across North Africa, South Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and East Asia. The mechanism is anchored in a northward displacement of the subtropical jet stream, which is driven by reduced meridional temperature gradients resulting from sea‐ice loss and Arctic amplification. The resulting Eurasian anticyclone weakens the tropospheric dipole of the polar vortex, promoting negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like anomalies and a pronounced Eurasian wave train. These reinforce the northward shift of the subtropical high and enhance warm‐moisture advection into northernmost margin summer monsoon belts. PAMIP ensemble experiments further indicate that future Arctic amplification will intensify this autumn monsoon persistence and its associated precipitation. Our findings are critical for understanding the intensification of late-season hydroclimatic extremes, underscoring the urgent need for improved seasonal forecasting, adaptive agricultural strategies, and flood-risk management in a warming climate.",

      "description": "Decarbonizing industrialized economies through electrification requires electricity systems to simultaneously achieve dramatic capacity expansion, sustained reliability, and emissions reductions. We present a novel soft-linkage methodology between the CIMS energy-economy model and the COPPER electricity system planning model to quantify how economy-wide policies translate into specific electricity system requirements and greenhouse gas outcomes for the Canadian province of British Columbia. Our analysis examines two scenarios: one reflecting implemented policies, and another adding proposed climate policies alongside electrified industrial projects, including liquefied natural gas facilities and large-scale mining operations. Results reveal dramatically different infrastructure requirements between scenarios, with the latter requiring substantially higher electricity capacity expansion, dominated by variable renewable energy and higher peak demand growth. Emissions outcomes diverge: while implemented policies deliver meaningful emissions reductions, net-zero aligned proposed policies achieve smaller overall reductions when accounting for prospective emissions from fossil fuel projects, which offset decarbonization elsewhere in the economy. Proactive energy system planning and accelerated infrastructure permitting and construction will be required to meet decarbonization and economic development goals. British Columbia’s experience may offer insights for other jurisdictions pursuing both natural resource development and climate goals. Our approach can be adapted by other jurisdictions using similar models to assess their own energy transition pathways.",

      "description": "Anthropogenic climate change has increased interactions between typhoons and marine heatwaves (MHWs) worldwide. Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022), which originated in the northwestern Pacific and weakened over the East Sea, demonstrates this interaction. While previous studies have explored typhoon intensification due to underlying MHWs, the formation of MHWs following a typhoon’s passage remains less understood. Post-typhoon MHWs can form due to local ocean heat uptake by anomalously cold sea surface temperatures overlying an anomalously warmer subsurface. This study provides the first detailed analysis of MHW formation on the west side of a typhoon path, off Korea’s east coast, approximately one week after the typhoon, using data from a fixed surface mooring. The results indicate that near-inertial internal gravity waves, influenced by sub-inertial background conditions, prevented the onset of the MHW during the week following the typhoon’s passage, despite favorable conditions such as coastal downwelling, increased surface net heat flux, and higher upper-ocean heat content.",

      "description": "This study reveals the physical mechanism behind anomalous surface incident solar radiation (Rs) attenuation in Beijing during the COVID-19 lockdown (February 2020). Sunshine Duration observations reveal the paradox of dimming event under strictest lockdown policies in February 2020 over Beijing. Modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis shows Rs decreased abruptly by 12.89 W·m−2 in February 2020 compared to 2015–2019 (pre-pandemic), which is confirmed by Himiwari-8 satellite retrieved Rs. Through multi-parameter attribution analysis, Shapley additive explanations indicated that an anomalous increase in aerosol optical depth contributed 31.700% to Rs attenuation, primarily driven by chemical formation of secondary organic aerosols that offset benefits from reduced primary emissions. Simultaneously, modified cloud physical properties collectively accounted for 38.02% to Rs attenuation. Specifically, doubled low cloud cover accounted for 23.89% while increased low cloud optical thickness contributed 13.52%. Further compounding these effects, weakened boundary layer dynamics exerted synergistic impacts: boundary layer height (BLH) compression (168.93 m) contributed 14.92% and reduced wind speed (0.63 m·s−1) contributed 9.51%, jointly promoting near-surface aerosol accumulation through suppressed pollutant diffusion. Additionally, elevated surface temperature (+1.36 °C) exacerbated Rs attenuation by facilitating aerosol nucleation and cloud condensation nucleus formation. Collectively, these findings challenge the assumption that emission reduction invariably improves Rs, ultimately confirming nonlinear climatic effects from coupled aerosol-cloud-Rs interactions under abrupt anthropogenic disturbances.",

      "description": "Ecosystem management requires integrative tools for planning and decision-making at landscape scales. Vegetation water content (VWC) has been proposed as a holistic indicator of entire plant water status and ecosystem functioning. However, few studies have explored its relationships with ecological and environmental factors, especially in data-scarce regions like Patagonia. In this study, we used the SMAP dataset to analyzed VWC patterns across vegetation types, landscapes, and climate anomalies over the 2015–2016 to 2024–2025 growing seasons in Southern Patagonia, covering Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces. The results show that VWC varies significantly among vegetation types. Forests and shrublands generally had higher VWC than grasslands. Among them, Nothofagus betuloides and evergreen mixed forests (NB) exhibited the highest VWC, with grasslands and dry shrublands being at the lowest level. Distinct seasonal VWC dynamics emerged along landscape gradients: a bell-shaped pattern in humid areas and an inverted bell-shaped pattern in arid ecosystems, primarily driven by winter snowmelt recharge and subsequent summer water stress. VWC responded differentially to El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode phases, with El Niño and La Niña exerting contrasting effects by province. To bridge science and application, we propose incorporating these metrics into adaptive management, specifically for: (i) defining conservation-priority zones for harvesting in water-limited forests, (ii) implementing dynamic fire risk thresholds based on seasonal depletion patterns, and (iii) adjusting silvopastoral stocking rates according to inter-annual VWC trends. These findings demonstrate that VWC is a robust indicator for guiding sustainable ecosystem management and conservation planning in Southern Patagonia.",

      "description": "In coastal areas, projected increases in the amplitude of the sea level seasonal cycle will lead to the intensification of coastal flood hazards. Conversely, projected decreases in the amplitude may act to suppress flood hazards in some regions, partially offsetting the impact of sea level rise. Simulations of the sea level seasonal cycle by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models suggest changes up to ±30% are projected under a high emission scenario. We demonstrate that a currently unaccounted increase of 5–10 cm in the sea level seasonal cycle will increase the frequency of extremes from once in 20 years to once in 10 years. However, the sea level seasonal cycle amplitudes in CMIP6 models are underestimated compared to seasonal variability observed by satellite altimetry for almost all coastlines, suggesting that future changes might be underestimated, leading to a large impact on extreme sea levels in coastal areas. Including the changes in the future sea level seasonal cycle will advance future projections of sea level extremes and contribute to the crucial decisions about adaptation in coastal areas.",

      "description": "Meeting Paris Agreement targets increasingly points to a need for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. While CDR seems promising, the associated uncertainties are not well known. One unexplored aspect is whether the uncertainties in CDR and transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) are coupled to any degree, e.g. some CDR methods could have lower carbon removal potential if TCRE are high. In this paper, we quantify the coupled uncertainties between TCRE and the CDR of ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and reforestation. To do so, we used a perturbed parameter ensemble with the University of Victoria Earth system climate model. These results were fed to train Kernel Flows-based model emulators, which in turn were used, together with observational data, to carry out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to characterize Bayesian posterior distributions. It turns out that OAE results in slow but steady CDR, with temperature reduction nearly linearly related to the amount of carbon removed. CDR with OAE is also only weakly dependent on uncertain climate system parameters and TCRE, indicating that OAE is a reliable CDR method with respect to the coupled uncertainties between its removal potential and TCRE. CDR of reforestation slows down after 50 years, and its temperature reduction from biogeochemical effects is offset by the warming biogeophysical effects, as reforesting pastures lowers albedo. Moreover, CDR by reforestation shows a strong dependency on uncertain climate system parameters and negatively correlates with TCRE, implying that it is less reliable as a CDR method. We argue that CDR potential, timescale of CDR, and uncertainty coupling between TCRE and CDR should all be considered when designing robust climate change mitigation portfolios.",

      "description": "Surface soil moisture (mrsos) and vertically integrated soil moisture (mrsol) over the top 10 cm should, by definition, be physically consistent in Earth System Models (ESMs). However, an evaluation of nine CMIP6 models reveals substantial inconsistencies: in some models, mrsos and integrated mrsol agree globally; in others, they align only in specific regions; and in a few, they diverge across all grid cells. These discrepancies arise from a combination of factors, including metadata errors, inconsistent variable definitions, or diagnostic sequencing within the model. We demonstrate how such issues can lead to significant biases, even when both variables are present and seemingly well-defined. As model complexity increases and multi-model comparisons become more common, assumptions about variable equivalence may lead to flawed conclusions. This study highlights the need for routine consistency checks, improved metadata standards, and community-wide practices that ensure reliability of derived variables across ESM outputs, particularly in preparation for CMIP7.",

      "description": "Afforestation and reforestation (AR) are effective strategies for large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and climate change mitigation, as they offer the potential to sequester vegetation and soil carbon. However, the expansion of AR raises concerns about the adverse impacts on biodiversity. While local studies have assessed these impacts, global-scale evaluations remain limited. Our study addressed the need for a comprehensive approach to mitigate the risks of AR and enhance its potential as a nature-based solution for both CDR and biodiversity conservation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for assessing AR’s strategic potential using a species distribution framework that considers both favorable and unfavorable effects on species in forest landscapes. We propose a biome-specific spatial prioritization framework to delineate where AR may negatively affect biodiversity. By adopting a habitat suitability index as a biodiversity proxy, our approach increased the compatibility between climate mitigation goals (i.e. carbon storage) and biodiversity conservation. We found that in forest biomes, and particularly in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome and the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, many areas offer high carbon sequestration per unit area alongside high habitat suitability values. However, even within the same biome, the impact of AR on biodiversity can vary among locations. Among the non-forested biomes, the existing species in temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands are particularly vulnerable to AR if carbon sequestration is prioritized over biodiversity. To mitigate these risks, prioritizing ecosystem restoration can support biodiversity and restore degraded lands to produce ecosystems that are tailored to regional ecological contexts. Our approach highlights how and where AR strategies can be deployed to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation.",

      "description": "The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is a critical agricultural region but is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly flooding. Nevertheless, flood resilience in the VMD has improved through engineering and adaptive practices initiated by local governments and farmers. However, the understanding of the internal interactions among flood resilience measures remains limited. Cho Moi district, An Giang province, VMD, has experienced flooding but shown resilience since the implementation of the South Vam Nao project, making it a representative case for flood resilience investigation. This study employs qualitative methods and Bayesian network (BN) analysis to examine the interrelationships among flood resilience measures in Cho Moi district to address the research gap. The results indicate that the project has facilitated coordination between the local governments and citizens, enhancing farmers’ capacity to reduce flood impacts. A BN inference test, assuming that all measures perform at 100% ‘High’ efficiency, illustrates that the current system configuration performs strongly overall. ‘High-dike construction’ is also highlighted as the central measure facilitating the transformation of agricultural practices. Yet, without the presence of high dikes, farmers remain the most critical factor in sustaining resilience, regardless of the adequacy of government-led measures. The study recommends redesigning the height of the high-dike system to mitigate landslide risk and address other environmental problems, such as nutrient-rich alluvium loss and soil compaction, while ensuring adequate flood protection. The study introduces an innovative framework for flood resilience assessment, helping governments understand their water management systems and identify necessary improvements to enhance flood resilience.",

      "description": "The international discourse on loss and damages (L&Ds) under the climate convention is ongoing. Significant attention has been given to a dedicated fund to assist vulnerable countries to recover from climate related L&D. While much of the political discussion focuses on the amount of funding needed and who should pay, less attention is given to risk reduction initiatives eligible for the L&D funding mechanisms. There is also an emerging need to link L&D funding with adaptation (funds) which is not yet being given enough consideration. Against this background, the paper presents different dimensions of L&D for example on severity and compensability, and provides a new perspective that goes beyond the current discourse of economic versus non-economic or direct versus indirect L&D. A global analysis is complemented with a set of L&D related case studies to explore both conventional economic dimensions of L&D, and under-represented dimensions, such as population displacement and human mobility, territory and cultural heritage. These cases highlight how different types of L&D are articulated in climate related initiatives. The cases point towards the need to better connect L&D and adaptation strategies and funding to strengthen climate resilience. The paper informs the ongoing international debate on L&D, highlighting the importance of understanding its different dimensions, the effectiveness of climate-related policies across countries and the need to rethink the concept of L&D as compensation, since this falls short of supporting climate resilience.

      "description": "Weather extremes are increasingly threatening food security across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where maize serves as a critical staple for millions of smallholder farmers. While most research to date concentrated on climate impacts on crop yields, the climatic determinants of harvested area (ha) which is an equally important component of production, remain insufficiently explored. Employing a machine learning framework on historical maize production and climate datasets, this study evaluates how both mean climate conditions and weather extremes have influenced maize yield and ha across SSA from 1979 to 2021. Our findings indicate that reported yield reductions are predominantly attributable to heat and drought stress, while contractions in ha are primarily associated with episodes of excessive wetness. Notably, our models account for a greater proportion of variance in ha (R2 up to 0.75) than in yield (R2 ≈ 0.43). This suggests that fluctuations in cultivation area are more readily anticipated from climate signals, potentially reflecting farmers’ proactive adjustments to wet conditions, than the more complex physiological responses of yield to heat stress. The rising frequency of area-related shocks, in contrast to relatively stable trends in yield-shock, signals a shifting landscape of production risks. Collectively, these findings elucidate two principal climate-risk pathways: heat and drought diminishing yields, and wetness extremes constraining cultivated area. These insights underscore the urgent need for agronomic innovation, targeted economic incentives, and infrastructural investment to enhance the resilience of maize-based systems in SSA.",

Renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power provides opportunities to mitigate sectoral water use, but quantifying their effects on the water-energy-land nexus remains challenging. Using an engineering-economic optimization model, this study quantifies how, and to what extent, energy transition towards PV and wind mitigates water competition between the energy and land sectors in the Yellow River Basin from 2020 to 2050. Results show that under current conditions, energy water use increases by 32.9 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+34.2%) while irrigation water decreases by 23.3 × 108 m3 yr−1 (−12.7%) compared to the baseline. Transitioning to PV and wind energy, alongside electricity transmission, substantially alleviates the competition. Energy water use decreases by 82.1 × 108 m3 yr−1 (−63.7%) across the basin, and irrigation water is replenished by 21.9 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+54.7%) in Inner Mongolia and 1.6 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+35.9%) in Shandong. Though costly, the transmission line from Inner Mongolia and Shandong is prioritized for reducing the local consumption of renewable energy, ensuring downstream energy supply and restoring irrigation water availability. These findings underscore the critical role of transitioning to renewable energy in resolving sectoral water conflicts, and highlight the importance of electricity transmission in balancing spatial disparities in energy and irrigation demands across the basin.",

Our results indicate that winter wheat generally enhances SOC levels, but its effectiveness is modulated by climate. Cooler regions experience higher SOC gains, whereas warmer regions show diminished or even negative effects.

      "description": "The Brazilian Amazon contains approximately 40% of the world’s tropical rainforest and plays a critical role in preserving biodiversity and regulating water, energy and carbon cycles. However, deforestation and increasingly frequent droughts, heatwaves and wildfires threaten these rainforests. Amazonian fires are generally assumed to be entirely anthropogenic, which has led to lightning-ignited fires being underexplored. Here, we present the first detailed assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of lightning-ignited fires in the Amazon rainforest to elucidate the role of lightning and human ignitions in shaping Amazon fire dynamics. To do this, we matched cloud-to-ground lightning strokes from the Global Lightning Dataset (GLD360) with individual fire events between 2019 and 2024 to obtain a probability of lightning ignition for each fire. We also calculated a human-ignition probability index using proximity to roads, waterways, and human land cover as proxies for human activity. By combining both probabilistic indices with ground-observed lightning ignitions from eight protected areas, we could optimize the threshold that determines if an ignition is more likely to be caused by lightning or human activities. We estimate that in the Brazilian Amazon, lightning caused on average 0.2%–0.4% of all fires each year (234–407 ignitions per year) and 1.1%–1.2% of the annually burned area (1226–1358 km2 per year) between 2019 and 2024. More than 89% of these fires occurred in the late dry season between August and November, peaking in September and October. Despite lightning-ignited fires contributing a small proportion of all Amazonian fires, they constitute over 25% of the fires in identified grid clusters in parts of the states of Pará (particularly in the Breves region), Amazonas, and Rondônia. This study provides the first estimation of the role of natural ignitions in Amazon fire dynamics and a scientific basis for understanding their contribution within the region.",

      "description": "Land surface temperature provides a fingerprint of the surface energy balance. Under similar radiative forcing, particularly during daytime and clear-sky conditions, its temporal variability is expected to be coupled to surface conditions such as availability of soil moisture and plant functional conditions. In this study, we use Earth observations to identify regions with a strong interannual co-variability between the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature and surface soil moisture. Land surface temperature is taken from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Applications Facility on Land Surface Analysis and soil moisture from the Copernicus Climate Change Service for the period 2004–2023 over the 0° Meteosat Second Generation region, encompassing Africa and Europe. We introduce a new metric to quantify the soil moisture-temperature interannual co-variability in the satellite data, which is then applied to evaluate the fifth reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ERA5). Earth observations and ERA5 show similar spatial co-variability patterns across much of the domain, highlighting regions of transition between climate zones. However, ERA5 shows weaker co-variability in regions with large interannual vegetation variability. These findings suggest that accurately capturing the interannual variability of land surface temperature and its co-variability with soil moisture, in regions with large vegetation variability, may require a dynamic representation of vegetation status, beyond the mean annual cycles currently implemented in ERA5.",
