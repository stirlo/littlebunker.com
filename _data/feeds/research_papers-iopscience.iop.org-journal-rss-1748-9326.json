      "description": "The distribution and fate of marine microplastics have become central concerns in ocean science, yet the literature remains strongly biased toward coastal and surface environments. This review presents a systematic analysis of over 40 000 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science between 1980 and 2024, classified according to their disciplinary scope, marine environment, and climate-inspired framing (diagnosis, mitigation, adaptation). Our results reveal persistent structural imbalances: biology dominates thematically, beaches and coastlines dominate spatially, and diagnostic efforts far outnumber mitigation or adaptation studies. Crucially, the deep ocean—despite comprising the majority of marine volume and likely acting as a long-term reservoir for microplastics—remains severely underrepresented. Studies that include sampling below 1000 m are rare, and most lack specific geographic metadata. While the growth in microplastics literature is robust, its conceptual and spatial coverage remains narrow. We argue for a strategic expansion of research to include the full depth and breadth of the ocean, and for increased interdisciplinarity to reduce current uncertainties in global plastic budgets and support evidence-based mitigation efforts.",

      "description": "The global energy transition is accelerating demand for critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, and copper. Although essential for low-carbon technologies, the extractions of these mineral resources create significant socio-environmental costs. The 11 Letters curated in this Focus Issue of Environmental Research Letters bring interdisciplinary perspectives to highlight the social and environmental complexities of energy-transition mineral extraction. There is a rich diversity of geographies, commodity types, technology uses, methodological approaches, and temporal and spatial scales represented in this issue. They collectively shed light on the complex interactions between extraction, justice, and sustainability concerns for some of the most remote and marginalized frontline regions globally. They also reveal both the urgency and the opportunity for systemic change in how societies govern, monitor, and participate in resource extraction. This editorial synthesizes these contributions, identifies emerging insights, and outlines a forward-looking agenda to help inform discussions across policy and practice on a just and responsible energy transition.",

      "title": "Strongly reducing sediments hinder restoration of a eutrophic coastal marine ecosystem",

      "description": "Anthropogenic activities are causing deoxygenation of coastal waters leading to degradation of such ecosystems globally. In the Dutch Southwest Delta, coastal management has turned tidal waters into marine lakes. The ensuing stagnation and stratification in combination with eutrophication has caused a decline in water quality, including decreased oxygen (O2) saturation. Restoring such systems is challenging as exemplified by Lake Veere, which was reconnected to the tidal marine Eastern Scheldt, via a culvert, two decades ago. After an initial improvement, water quality strongly declined again in recent years. Here, we investigate the consequences of the restoration effort on coastal deoxygenation by leveraging existing monitoring data of oxygen, temperature, salinity, and benthic macroinvertebrates. In addition, we quantified the O2 demand of the sediment at selected sites via field measurements. Water quality monitoring data indicate that the restored tidal influence resulted in strong improvements in O2 saturation of bottom waters. However, improvements were confined to the eastern part nearby the inflow of marine water. Modelled bottom water O2 concentrations and observed benthic macroinvertebrate densities are related, and show reduced densities under low-O2, especially for less mobile infauna. This highlights the detrimental effect of deoxygenation on benthic faunal communities. Geochemical analyses reveal a very high sedimentary O2 demand, mainly caused by high concentrations of the reduced solutes ammonium and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). These solutes are toxic and are formed by anaerobic (re)mineralization of organic matter. Furthermore, low availability of easily reducible iron-oxides in the lake sediments mutes the formation of iron-sulphides, explaining high porewater H2S concentrations, and release of H2S into bottom waters. Combined, our results illustrate the challenge of restoring a coastal ecosystem by increasing lateral oxygen supply without addressing the legacy effects of eutrophication in the sediments, reemphasizing the importance of nutrient reductions in restoration strategies.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The increasing impact of tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall underscores the need to understand regional variations in its spatial distribution. Using high-resolution satellite precipitation data from 1998–2023, this study investigates changes in the spatial inhomogeneity of TC rainfall across China. Results show that TC rainfall inhomogeneity decreases significantly by about 65%, indicating a reduced rainfall in historically high-TC-rainfall areas and an increase in low-TC-rainfall areas. Regionally, this decline is mainly governed by the intra‐regional component in East China, where opposing trends between high- and low-rainfall areas have substantially reduced spatial disparities. In contrast, North China shows a marked increase in TC rainfall, accompanied by increased intra‐regional but decreased inter‐regional inhomogeneity, largely offsetting each other. Other regions exhibit minor or insignificant contributions. These spatial reorganizations of TC rainfall in East and North China are closely linked to the northward migration of TC activity in recent decades, driven by reduced landfalling TCs over Taiwan and Fujian and increased inland penetration of TCs into East and North China. The findings reveal a restructuring of TC rainfall patterns and emphasize the growing regional contrasts in TC‐related hydroclimatic impacts, providing new insights for disaster risk assessments and regional climate adaptation strategies in China.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, exerting a significant influence on ocean circulation and marine productivity. In the present climate, positive SAM phases enhance Ekman-driven northward nutrient transport, leading to delayed increases in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the mid-latitude South Pacific. However, the extent to which this relationship will persist under future climate change remains uncertain. Here, we investigate future changes in the SAM–Chl-a relationship using Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble simulations under the shared socioeconomic pathway3−7.0 scenario. A subset of ensemble members that successfully reproduce observed present-day SAM–Chl-a lag correlations was selected for analysis. In the historical period (1970–2014), Chl-a anomalies in the mid-latitude eastern South Pacific show a distinct peak approximately three months after positive SAM events, associated with enhanced northward nutrient transport. In contrast, future projections (2070–2100) reveal a weakened or absent lagged response, coinciding with reduced westerly wind anomalies and diminished Ekman transport. These results suggest that the SAM’s influence to regulate marine productivity in the mid-latitude South Pacific may decline under continued climate change. This has important implications for future biogeochemical dynamics and highlights the need for high-resolution modeling to better represent fine-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Understanding how tides respond to short-term climate variability and long-term climatic trends is central to projecting future coastal hazards. While past research has focused on tide-surge or tide-river interactions, the relationships among tidal constituents themselves remain unexplored. Here we present the first global analysis of tidal constituent co-variability using tide gauge records available since mid–20th century. For each gauge, we identify the dominant constituent and evaluate its rank correlation with other major constituents (M2, N2, S2, O1, K1, MK3, MS4) using a moving window approach that ensures representing nonlinear interactions in high temporal resolution. Correlations were first quantified over the full observational record to characterize the multi-decadal co-variability across the observation network. Subsequently, comparisons between an earlier period (1950–1980) and a more recent period (1981–2019) were conducted to evaluate the presence of nonstationarity in these relationships. Finally, correlation structures were examined under distinct El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases to assess the extent to which large-scale climate variability modulates these dependencies. Results show that tidal constituents exhibit significant co-variability at roughly one-fifth of stations analyzed, with significant changes over time. Significantly larger number of locations (almost twice) exhibit co-variability in the recent era when compared to the earlier period (especially in the North Pacific). ENSO further modulates these relationships, with distinct patterns found during El Niño and La Niña years. These findings reveal that tidal constituents do not vary independently, but co-evolve under both interannual climate variability and long-term change. Recognizing this overlooked dimension of tides provides new insight into tidal dynamics and has important implications for assessing future compound coastal flooding in a warming climate.",

      "description": "Desert lakes worldwide are being lost to human water diversions and land use change, creating ‘sacrifice zones’ that benefit distant interests. In the American West, scholarly interest has focused on water diversions by both public and private interests as the primary driver of desert lake decline, underscoring how assumptions that public interests support conservation while private interests support development can be misleading. Land use and its underlying motives are also important as they modify surrounding desert basins and impact local social conditions in ways that also defy such assumptions, but are less examined in this context. How can we move beyond the binary of public and private interests to identify distinct patterns of sacrifice zone formation through land use? Here, we propose a typology that goes beyond the public–private binary to systematically measure landowner motives according to a landowner’s publicness, economic objective, and degree of absenteeism, identifying support-, speculation- and sacrifice-motivated landowners. We test three variants of this typology across eight desert basins with differing conservation trajectories. Our results show that (1) the motives related to mixed-use public parcels strongly shape basin-level summaries of motive in terms of area, underscoring their management importance for overall basin land use; (2) although sacrifice- and speculation-motivated private landowners are few, they hold consolidated estates; and (3) their land use activities likely have disproportionate social and ecological impacts. Case summaries of the dynamics for three representative basins further demonstrate the additional insights that could be generated by applying our typology longitudinally and pairing it with qualitative insights. This typology provides a systematic tool for characterizing landowner motives in sacrifice zones. Future research should focus on longitudinal applications and identifying appropriate indicators of social and ecological conditions.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Global trade in agricultural and livestock commodities plays a significant role in driving deforestation, as land-use changes in producer countries often supply consumption in distant regions. Although numerous studies have quantified deforestation embodied in traded products, much less is known about the underlying economic and institutional factors that explain why some countries export or import more of it than others. This study addresses these questions by examining the determinants of embodied deforestation in international trade flows. Drawing on Factor Endowment Theory, we test whether income levels, land availability, and institutional quality influence the distribution of embodied forest loss between exporting and importing countries. Using a gravity model estimated through Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood, we assess how GDP, distance, trade composition, and governance shape embodied deforestation patterns in agricultural and livestock commodities. Results highlight a prominent role of GDP per capita as a driver of deforestation: a 1% increase in per capita GDP is associated, on average, with a 0.28% decrease in deforestation embodied in exports, but with a 0.88% increase in embodied deforestation imports, reflecting an outsourcing of land-use pressures. While developing countries embody comparatively more deforestation in their exports, higher-income importing countries increasingly shift the environmental burden of their consumption to other regions through imports. Domestic consumption factors, such as higher per capita meat demand, are also positively associated with embodied deforestation inflows: a 1 kg increase in yearly meat consumption per capita is linked to a 1.8% rise in embodied deforestation inflows. Overall, the findings highlight the structural asymmetries of global trade and underscore the responsibility of affluent nations in driving deforestation beyond their borders. They also suggest that both production- and consumption-side policies are needed to mitigate embodied deforestation in high-impact commodity sectors.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "We present a typology of 2205 U.S. transit systems, derived from 167 operational indicators in the National Transit Database, to reveal distinct patterns. Using kernel principal component analysis and Gaussian mixture modeling, we identify five distinct transit system types: Metro Bus–Rail, Mid-Sized Urban, Hybrid Multimodal, Urban Specialized, and Diverse Operations. We also discover a gap in diesel consumption reporting (76% of systems), which are predominantly of the Mid-Sized Urban type. To bridge this critical data gap, we apply extreme gradient boosting to predict the diesel consumption for 1674 underreported systems. We then estimate lifecycle emissions, accounting for regional grid carbon intensity. The result highlights significant variability in diesel consumption and emissions across transit types, with Metro Bus–Rail systems contributing the highest emissions. To evaluate decarbonization potential, we simulate fleet electrification and grid decarbonization. Our scenario analyses indicate that up to 82% of 10.27 MMTCO2e diesel-based transit emissions can be eliminated through fleet electrification, with further grid decarbonization eliminating the remainder. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize electrification, optimize resource allocation, and support sustainable transit strategies in the U.S.",
