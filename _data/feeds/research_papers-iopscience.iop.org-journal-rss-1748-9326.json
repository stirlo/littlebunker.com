      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate simulations of the industrial era typically start in 1850, using the first fifty years as a baseline for ‘pre-industrial’ climate. However, the period immediately prior to 1850 is of particular interest due to early human influence and heightened volcanic activity, the latter of which led to cooler global temperatures than those observed in the subsequent historical period. In this study, we present a suite of Earth system model simulations (using UKESM1.1) that start in 1750 and span the entire industrial period. We compare these simulations to a new instrumental observation-based dataset, GloSATref, which provides global surface air temperature variations from 1781 onwards. We investigate the climatic changes during the early industrial period, separating the effects of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Model-simulated early-19th-century temperature patterns show substantial cooling relative to the long-term mean, particularly in low latitudes, which agree well with observed patterns. We find significant long-term differences between simulations initialized in 1750 and 1850, with lasting effects well into the 20th century, consistent with differences in vegetation and the substantial ocean cooling driven by high volcanic activity in the 1750 simulations. Our results indicate that an earlier start to historical simulations could lead to more representative climate simulations over the historical period, and deepen our understanding of early anthropogenic warming, natural climate variability, and the climate responses to future volcanic eruptions.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "While heatwaves in the atmosphere and oceans are well documented, soil heatwaves under climate change remain largely unknown. This gap is critical as soil provides a host of vital ecosystem services, which are highly vulnerable to soil heat extremes. Here, we present a nationwide assessment of historical soil heatwave changes across the Mainland of China using an observational homogenized soil temperature dataset. We find that deeper soils experience less intense but longer-lasting heatwaves than shallower ones. Since 1960, soil heatwave frequency, duration, and intensity have increased in all depths, with deeper soils showing greater increases in duration and smaller increases in intensity. These trends have been accelerated recently by ∼50% (∼100%) in shallow (deep) soils during 1990–2017, relative to 1960–2017. Around 60.4% of China’s croplands are facing increasing exposure to soil heatwaves, especially in major breadbaskets such as the North China Plain. Our findings underscore the growing urgency of understanding soil heatwave behaviors and impacts.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae2ee9",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Although national emission control policies have contributed to long-term reductions in PM2.5 levels, responses across neighboring cities remain heterogeneous, complicating the evaluation of policy effectiveness. This study diagnoses the spatial structure and examines temporal evolution of intercity-scale (tens of kilometers) and neighborhood-scale (a few kilometers) PM2.5 components, separated from background variation including long-range transport, by applying a recently proposed spatial decomposition framework based on spatial coherence to long-term air quality monitoring network data in South Korea (2016–2023). Within this framework, a hierarchical averaging scheme uses coherence-based neighboring stations to define the intercity-scale variability of background-removed PM2.5 concentrations. Focusing on the cold season (DJFM), spatial diagnosis reveals dominant intercity-scale contributions in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and neighboring industrialized areas, highlighting the effectiveness of air control zone-based policies. In contrast, neighborhood-scale contributions predominate in high-PM2.5 stations, particularly in the Southeastern Area (SEA), indicating the need for localized interventions. Temporal analysis reveals a structural transition beginning in 2019/20 DJFM, characterized by simultaneous trend reversals: intercity-scale components shifted from increasing to decreasing in the SMA, an area with intensive urban and industrial emissions, while the opposite occurred in the SEA, a coastal city cluster. This transition coincided with the implementation of the Seasonal PM Management policy and the COVID-19 lockdown. The variations in the intercity-scale component broadly align with residual emission intensities of PM2.5 and NOx, defined as deviations from national emission trends based on the Clean Air Policy Support System emission inventory. These results reveal a structural shift in intercity-scale PM2.5 variability and its linkage to emissions, offering a scalable diagnostic tool for evaluating policy effectiveness and underscoring the need for scale-specific air quality management strategies.",

      "description": "Climate change affects both the mean state and its variability. Hence, the decomposition of climate variability into a forced response and internal variability is essential to understand climate change. Especially how the hydrological cycle will change is still uncertain. Here, we use ensemble simulations to elucidate the forced response and internal variability changes in a hot world beyond 2100 in the Community Earth System Model version 2. We extract the dominant modes of the forced response and of internal variability. The dominant mode of the forced response of the hydrological cycle changes sign in the early 22nd century, even though greenhouse gas emissions are decreasing. We find that pronounced atmospheric circulation changes are largely responsible for the hydrological cycle shift. The dominant modes of internal variability exhibit significant reduced amplitude of the variability after the forced response mode changes its sign, suggesting that the forced response has significant impact on internal variability. These results have implications for anthropogenic climate change beyond 2100.",

      "description": "Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a key role in the water cycle and balance, and its estimation is of paramount importance in hydrological studies. This variable is also strongly influenced by the land use and land cover (LULC). This study use a synthesis approach to analyse the relationship between ET variation and LULC transformation in the period 1990–2020. The study area represents a major agricultural region in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam between the Mekong and Bassac rivers. The multivariate dataset was ingested into the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool to examine the multidecadal ET evolution across the study region. The ET evolution is investigated together with LULC changes to identify the primary drivers of the ET change. The results reveal an increase in landscape fragmentation together with a decrease in ET. The reduction in ET is associated with the decrease in water surfaces corresponding to upstream dam operations and with the construction of new urban areas. In the coastal area, a conversion from natural areas (i.e. mangroves cover) to aquaculture has been observed, leading to a slight increase in ET.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The vast heterogeneity in dietary practices and demographic structures across China has led to pronounced regional disparities in food demand and environmental impacts. Yet, most existing assessments remain at the national level, overlooking regional diversity and differences in nutritional intake. This study integrates provincial dietary preferences, age–gender–residence–specific energy requirements, and environmental constraints on cropland, blue water, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). By 2050, national food demand is projected at 403–510 Mt, requiring 53–66 Mha of cropland, 128–148 km3 of blue water, and 544–790 MtCO2e of GHG emissions. Diets with carbohydrate-derived energy exceeding 55% exhibit lower environmental pressures and greater alignment with sustainability goals than the Chinese Dietary Guidelines. The findings offer critical insights into regional diet-environment linkages and support the development of food management strategies tailored to diverse regional conditions.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae3095",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Flooding presents a significant risk to concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), especially in regions increasingly affected by extreme weather events. This study uses advanced geospatial analysis techniques to assess the environmental and economic vulnerabilities of 12 703 CAFOs across Iowa, United States. We focused on the exposure of CAFOs to 100 year and 500 year floodplains, integrating floodplain maps with location data operational characteristics, and livestock types (cattle and swine) to assess flood risk. The analysis also considered the size and construction year of each CAFO, offering insights into how older and larger operations are disproportionately vulnerable. The results indicate that over 1.9 million animal units (13% of total), are located within the 100 year floodplain. In the 500 year flood floodplain, it increases to 2.05 million animal units, representing 14% of the state’s total. Sioux, Lyon, and Hancock counties were identified as having particularly high potential flood exposure, with over 16% of animal units in Sioux County located within the 100 year floodplain, increasing to 17% within the 500 year floodplain. The study shows that larger CAFOs, particularly those built before 2004, were often located in flood-prone areas and, if either a 100- or 500 year flood occurs, would potentially affect a larger number of animal units due to their operational scale. These risks not only threaten livestock but also have far-reaching economic consequences, including significant operational disruptions, infrastructure damage, and cascading effects on supply chains and market stability. As extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change, these findings highlight the need for heightened awareness of CAFO vulnerabilities and call for further research into adaptive strategies to protect Iowa’s agricultural sector.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "In mid-April 2024, the Arabian Peninsula was struck by an extreme rainfall event, during which some areas received an entire year’s worth of precipitation within just 24 h. The United Arab Emirates was the hardest hit, experiencing widespread flooding, four fatalities, and economic damages exceeding USD 544 million. Analysis of multiple precipitation datasets confirmed that this was the most intense daily rainfall event ever recorded in the region. To investigate the system responsible, a state-of-the-art storm-tracking algorithm was applied to reconstruct the evolution of the mesoscale convective system that caused the hazard. Findings revealed that peak intensity occurred on 16 April, contributing more than 70% of the total event rainfall. Synoptic-scale diagnostics pointed to the rare convergence of two key drivers: enhanced low-level moisture transport via a strengthened Somali low-level jet (SLLJ) and an unusually strong Arabian Cold Vortex in the mid-troposphere. Long-term reanalysis data indicate that such a combination is extremely rare, observed on only 0.006% of all days in the 1940–2024 daily record, previously exceeded only during the 2019 Iran floods. However, forecasts from 11 models in the International Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive consistently underestimated rainfall (mean bias of −63.6%), due to the severe underestimation of the SLLJ and the moderate overestimation of 500 hPa geopotential height. These results underscore the growing threat of extreme precipitation in arid regions and emphasize the urgent need to improve model capabilities in forecasting moisture dynamics and upper-level disturbances under the changing climate.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Lakes are an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the indirect N2O emission factor (EF) model, applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for estimating inland water N2O emissions, is inadequate for lakes due to uncertainties in the N2O production pathways and significant spatiotemporal variations in EF values. Herein, we combined in situ N2O emission investigations, metagenomic sequencing, and isotopic mapping techniques to determine the pathway of N2O production and environmental control of EF values in shallow eutrophic lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Dissolved N2O concentration exhibited a significant correlation with nitrate (NO3−-N), coupled with a positive relationship between the (nirK+ nirS)/nosZ ratio and N2O fluxes. Furthermore, a δ15NSP-δ18ON2O mapping approach model verified that 94.0 ± 9.1% of the total N2O production was contributed by denitrification. These observations jointly demonstrated that denitrification dominated the N2O production in the studied lacustrine system. Based on these findings, the nitrogen source (NO3−-N) concentration for denitrification and the ratio of the carbon source (dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) to NO3−-N concentration (DOC/NO3−-N) were incorporated into a model, both of which showed high correlations with EF values in the studied lacustrine system and global meta-analysis dataset. This model, which provides a good fit, corrects N2O emission overestimations from IPCC models by using easily obtained water quality variables.",

      "description": "As climate conditions intensify fire seasons, human exposure to wildfire smoke becomes a more significant concern, posing health risks and disrupting emotional and social well-being. Academic literature exploring how people perceive and respond to wildfire smoke has grown rapidly in the past decade. We conducted this systematic review with three objectives: to characterize the topical, geographic, and disciplinary focus of existing research, examine the application of established behavioral theories to smoke protection behaviors, and identify emergent themes and research gaps. Following PRISMA standards, we systematically reviewed papers focusing on individual-level human perception or behavioral responses to wildfire smoke events. We extracted information on eight psychosocial constructs across three levels: intrapersonal (cognitive processes: emotions, threat appraisal, coping appraisal), interpersonal (social influences: social networks, social norms), and contextual factors (past experience, access to information, demographic attributes). Our review of 39 studies reveals an emerging field concentrated in the Western US and dominated by public health perspectives. Only ten studies employed explicit theoretical models. We found complex relationships between psychosocial constructs: while people generally recognize smoke as threatening, the relationship between threat perception and protective action remains complex, with mixed findings regarding past experience and coping appraisal. Social networks play a paradoxical role, providing crucial support during smoke events while being disrupted by smoke-induced isolation that prevents normal social gathering. Social norms around smoke protection remain underexplored. Socially vulnerable populations are underrepresented despite facing heightened exposure risks. We identify significant research gaps regarding emotional responses, social norms, and community-level interventions. Enhanced understanding of wildfire smoke responses can improve interventions and policies to promote public health and community adaptation to wildfire smoke.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Understanding long-term precipitation changes in Southeast Asia (SEA) is important because the region is highly vulnerable to precipitation-related disasters. This study examines typhoon and non-typhoon heavy precipitation over SEA during 1960–2024 using a typhoon track dataset and three high-resolution precipitation products. Results show a significant decrease in typhoon-precipitation contribution to total precipitation across the entire SEA, both in its continental and maritime regions, especially during the boreal summer half-year. This trend persists under heavy precipitation conditions (95th and 99th percentiles). In contrast, based on tracking results, non-typhoon heavy precipitation shows increases in precipitation area but decreases in lifespan intensity, yielding more total precipitation per event. Our findings indicate a shifting hazard regime: a decrease in typhoon-related rainfall is being offset by a spatial expansion of non-typhoon heavy precipitation, introducing a new regional risk. The findings provide critical insights into the change of regional precipitation patterns and have implications for disaster management and adaptation in SEA.",
