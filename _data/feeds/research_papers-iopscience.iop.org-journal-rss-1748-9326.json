      "description": "Marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) implementations can potentially remove 1–15 Gt CO2 yr−1, which encompasses the minimum requirement removal of CDR in 2050 to limit warming below 2 °C by 2100. Despite their potential, mCDR represents only a tiny fraction of currently deployed CDR methods. Their implementations require not only a comprehensive understanding of the marine processes involved, but also a robust monitoring for their effectiveness and potential environmental impacts. In this work, we surveyed the mCDR scientific literature to identify measurable indicators for quantitative information across different ecosystems and methods used for monitoring the carbon removed and environmental side-effects, and explore the main common challenges. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol PRISMA: the search queries were established, and the literature search and criteria for inclusion/exclusion were transparently defined. Our results reveal the lack of a direct linkage from the mCDR-induced rates of chemical and biological changes to the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere and the magnitude of associated environmental side-effects. The heterogeneity of marine biogeochemical and ecological processes in time and space, together with the propagation of biogeochemical signals in an open system, represent the most common challenge reported for the monitoring approaches. Our results show that we are in need of indicators that provide reliable quantification of CO2 removal rates and information on environmental side-effects. Finally, based on our gap analysis, we provide monitoring recommendations, such as the use of common metrics and the baseline establishment. Currently, the lack of standardized indicators and monitoring procedures inhibits the verification, and hence, creates risks for further investment and prevents the entering of mCDRs in existing carbon certificate trading systems, hindering the long term growth of this sector.",

      "description": "Prescribed fire has emerged as an essential ecosystem management practice for maintaining forest health and mitigating wildfire risks. However, its spatio-temporal patterns and potential impacts on water quantity and quality remain poorly understood compared to those of wildfires. By analyzing the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database (1984–2022), we characterized distinct regional, seasonal and interannual dynamics of large prescribed fires relative to wildfires across the conterminous United States. We found the Southeast dominated the national prescribed fire regime, accounting for 78.6% of total prescribed fire occurrences and 70.7% of total burned area. Seasonally, prescribed fires primarily occurred in the spring, contrasting with wildfires that peak in autumn, particularly in the West and Southwest. Prescribed fires in the Southeast increased significantly from the early 2000s, peaking around 2010, then temporarily declined, whereas wildfires in the West exhibited an overall upward trend with substantial interannual variability. Our synthesis of studies from 1969 to 2024 showed that prescribed fire could potentially reduce evapotranspiration, but increase surface runoff through alterations of vegetation structure, rainfall partitioning, soil properties, and flow generation processes. Additionally, prescribed fire may influence water quality by modifying soil nitrogen dynamics, dissolved carbon, erosion, and sediment transport. However, these impacts are typically short-lived and can be effectively mitgated through site-specific strategies, supporting the use of prescribed fires as as a safe and practical management tool. To this end, we developed an adaptive framework that guides prescribed burning by balancing its ecological and hydrological benefits against potenital risks, thereby promoting sustainable forest management, reducing wildfire risk, and protecting water resources.",

      "title": "Economic benefits and cost competitiveness of green hydrogen in decarbonizing China’s electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Green hydrogen has the potential to address two critical challenges in a zero-carbon energy system: balancing seasonal variability of solar and wind in the electricity sector, and replacing fossil fuels in hard-to-electrify sectors. In this study, focusing on China, we deploy a provincial-scale energy system planning and operation model to examine the technical and cost-optimal potential of green hydrogen to fully remove carbon-based fuels in the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors by 2050. Our results show that green hydrogen infrastructure can enable more cost-effective decarbonization of both the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors. First, in the zero-carbon electricity sector alone, utilizing green hydrogen as long-duration storage enables a 17% reduction in the electricity-only cost (ZE scenario) relative to one without hydrogen. However, cost savings hinge on the availability of underground hydrogen storage. Second, coupling the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors by sharing green hydrogen infrastructure reduces the combined energy system cost by 6% compared to a decoupled energy system. Third, the coupled energy system also makes green hydrogen comparable to fossil fuel-based gray and blue hydrogen costs in China. Allocating the entire savings realized in the coupled energy system to just the hydrogen used as fuel/feedstock in hard-to-electrify sectors yields a 24% reduction in the hydrogen-only cost relative to the cost under the decoupled system. Last, coupling hydrogen infrastructure between electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors yields a substantially different spatial pattern of hydrogen production. In the decoupled energy system, 80% of hydrogen demand in electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors is produced locally within the same provinces, but the coupled energy system cuts local production to 30%, shifting production to high renewable energy generating provinces. Understanding the spatial patterns of optimal hydrogen infrastructure siting will help plan an integrated electricity and hydrogen system that can cost-effectively decarbonize multiple sectors and China’s broader economy.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The boreal forest is a vital carbon sink. Using 250 year simulations for Canada’s Taiga Plains, a priority of the 2 billion trees program, we tested afforestation and reforestation (A/R) strategies that combine species mix, planting density and surface albedo. Medium-density (600–1400 trees ha−1) mixed stands with ∼25%–40% deciduous trees stored 15%–30% more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures by coupling rapid early growth with long-term retention and greater disturbance resilience. Replanting under-stocked stands with these mixtures raised long-term storage by 18%–30% over business-as-usual. Accounting for albedo showed pure evergreen or deciduous stands lost 6%–20% of their climate benefit, whereas mixed stands yielded net cooling and the highest sequestration (≈ 4.6–4.7 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1). Partial harvesting plus replanting preserved, and sometimes increased, ecosystem carbon (≈ 300–340 tC ha−1) and productivity (≈ 1.6–2.0 tC ha−1 yr−1) without raising risk. Blending fast-growing deciduous trees with long-lived conifers at intermediate density maximizes boreal A/R climate value and informs reforestation policy elsewhere.",

      "description": "Drought and extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense as the global climate warms, threatening forests worldwide. Subsurface conditions such as soil depth and groundwater availability can influence plant drought vulnerability. Yet, how subsurface factors interact with climate stress and shape forest vulnerability and die-off at landscape scales remains poorly understood. The record-breaking hot and dry 2023–2024 summer in southwestern Australia induced widespread stress in the Jarrah Forest ecosystem. Analysis of vegetation greenness anomalies using airborne geophysics data, groundwater depth records, climate data, and remote sensing revealed that vegetation die-off emerged from the interactions of heat, water stress, and subsurface conditions. Shallow soils, rocky substrates, and limited access to subsurface water predisposed vegetation to experience heat and drought stress. Identifying the role and location of subsurface features enables identification of vulnerable, and resilient, areas and will guide adaptive forest management for resilience against future climate extremes.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Only about one-third of global rivers (or tributaries) remain in a nearly natural condition, known as climate-sensitive rivers. We lack clear evidence on the changes in streamflow volume and timing of these rivers, which significantly compromises our capacity for protection. Here, we analyse alterations in streamflow and centre of timing at 1017 stream gauges across 812 climate-sensitive rivers and tributaries worldwide from 1950 to 2022. We observed increasing trends in streamflow volume (Q) at just over half of our sites (512), biased towards earlier changes in centre of timing (CT) (⩾−2 d yr−1), with more than 65% of records reflecting this trend. At over 80% of gauges, we found that rising Q and earlier CT are sensitive to increasing precipitation (P) and earlier centre of timing of precipitation (PCT). More than 60% of significant gauges show moderate to severe changes in Q and CT. We identified 104 global climate-sensitive rivers, located in subtropical, temperate and arctic regions, that have experienced large and severe changes based on long-term changes in Q seasonality (CT > ±15 d). Long-term changes in Q and CT may persist in rivers experiencing large and severe changes and intensify in those with minor and moderate changes. These changes will increase flooding, alter storage, cause water shortages, and degrade river health. We recommend proactive strategies including better streamflow monitoring, adaptive infrastructure (e.g. reservoirs, flood control), flexible flood management protocols, water-sharing agreements during droughts, and prioritised protection of ecosystems to buffer against variations in Q and CT.",

      "description": "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as a green development initiative, highlights the importance of regional cooperation among participating countries to address the possibility of non-native organisms. We created a database of 8655 non-native insect records from 3059 non-native insect species of 312 families to better understand invasion vulnerability. Results showed that Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera dominated, comprising 72.54% of all recorded non-native insects. Hotspots of non-native insects were primarily developed BRI corridor nations, such as New Zealand, Czechia, Austria and South Africa. These insects largely originated from Asia, Europe, and North America, with Oceania contributing the fewest. Model averaging and PLS path modeling showed that the merchandise imports and international tourism were positively correlated with non-native insect occurrences. 49.63% of the countries, including China, South Korea, Russia and Poland, were identified as medium- to high-vulnerable regions for non-native insect introduction. Finally, we recommend intergovernmental collaboration to promote proactive prevention and control measures for regional biosecurity.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Drought is a pervasive natural hazard that propagates through the hydrologic cycle, leading to water deficiencies across key hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture. However, understanding the intricate dynamics of drought propagation remains challenging because of spatiotemporal variability and interactions among multiple drought types, including meteorological drought (MD), agricultural drought (AD), and hydrological drought (HD). Traditional analytical methods struggle to capture these complexities, particularly when using high-dimensional time series data characterized by nonlinear causality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cause–effect-based framework that integrates the process-based Community Land Model (CLM5), a causal inference method (Peter–Clark momentary conditional independence (PCMCI)-CMIsymb), and causal effect (CE) analysis to investigate drought propagation across multiple time scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. CLM5 provides high-resolution spatiotemporal drought estimations, PCMCI-CMIsymb detects nonlinear causal relationships, and CE analysis quantifies propagation probabilities across varying time lags. The results demonstrate that (a) drought propagation patterns vary by time scale, with short-term (1 month) propagation occurring primarily from MD to AD, whereas long-term (12 month) propagation extends from MD to both AD and HD; (b) subregional HDs tend to influence each other across regions, with stronger interconnections observed at long-term time scales; and (c) the likelihood of drought propagation differs spatially, with higher probabilities of MD propagation into AD and HD in the middle and lower YRB at the 6 month time scale, mostly peaking at 40%–60% with a 1 month lag. This study presents an advanced analytical framework for drought assessment, providing insights for improving drought mitigation and water resource management, particularly in regions affected by spatial hydroclimatic variability.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae1754",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Maritime Continent (MC), a critical region for Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) propagation, is also a global hotspot for biomass burning aerosol emissions. While the barrier effect on MJO propagation over the MC is well documented, the role of aerosols in this process and its underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. Combining observations, reanalysis datasets and moisture budget diagnostics, this study demonstrates that absorbing aerosols from El Niño-enhanced wildfires significantly modulate MJO eastward propagation. During the boreal autumn (August–November), the peak season for aerosol loading, El Niño-induced subsidence over the MC exacerbates regional dryness and promotes widespread wildfires, further elevating aerosol concentrations. To isolate the aerosol impact from El Niño effects, we classified the MJO events under high- and low-aerosol conditions while controlling for similar Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies. Composite analyses reveal that the high aerosol loads disrupt the propagation of MJO convective envelopes, whereas MJO sustains eastward propagation under low-aerosol conditions. Mechanistically, enhanced shortwave absorption by elevated aerosols induces a boundary layer cold anomaly that suppresses low-level convergence, while simultaneous heating of the lower-to-mid troposphere enhances atmospheric stability. This combined thermal and thermodynamic effect weakens boundary layer moisture anomalies, inhibiting the development of shallow convection east of the MJO deep convection that is essential for sustained propagation. The findings highlight the overlooked role of MC aerosols in the MJO barrier effect via aerosol-radiation-convection interactions, suggesting that improved representation of aerosols in climate models may enhance MJO predictability.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The high seas comprise nearly half the Earth’s surface and the 2023 United Nations Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction agreement renewed efforts to better manage this vast area. Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) are tasked with a UN dual-mandate to ensure the (1) long-term conservation of fish stocks and their associated ecosystems while managing the (2) sustainable use of high seas fisheries. Building on a previous analysis, we developed 10 questions each for our 10 categories (e.g. catch targets, transparency, bycatch). These 100 questions were both descriptive (e.g. are there quantitative results of bycatch improvement?) while others indicated intent (e.g. are there plans to rebuild all declining stocks?) and used publicly available information to evaluate 16 RFMOs (with a score of 0, 0.5, or 1). The average score for all RFMOs out of 100 was 46 (max 61.5, min 29.5). There were six questions for which all RFMOs received a 0, 90 questions for which at least one RFMO scored a one, and a ‘best case’ score of 76.5 that aggregated the highest RFMO score across the 10 categories. This indicates a competence gap; no RFMO is achieving what is empirically documented as possible in one RFMO or another. We also analyzed satellite-derived fishing activity and target stock status. Five RFMO convention areas had the highest overall and density of fishing effort. On average, 56% of stocks targeted in RFMO convention areas were considered overexploited or collapsed. We did not find that RFMO scores were correlated with better management outcomes (i.e. target stock status and fishing effort). However, we found correlations between better target stock status and questions assessing protected area adoption, banning transshipment at-sea, and reducing allowable catches in response to overfishing—policies that few RFMOs have fully adopted. These findings indicate ways for RFMOs to improve high seas fisheries management that are immediately available and effective.",
