      "description": "Several US urban food action plans propose increasing local and regional vegetable production for the presumed environmental and nutritional benefits. However, such efforts, if applied nationwide, can propagate environmental benefits or disbenefits to other geographies that have not been previously evaluated. Our paper quantifies the environmental benefits and disbenefits at the metropolitan scale nationwide from various localization scenarios ranging in scope (e.g., meeting 25%–100% of local vegetable dietary demand through local production). For the first time, these localization targets are modeled nationwide with consistent methodology across 378 metropolitan areas, considering three different land reutilization scenarios: (1) shifting current commodity cropland to vegetables, (2) leveraging marginal urban land, and (3) a novel strategy of repurposing parking lots and roads, anticipating the future deployment of shared autonomous vehicle fleets. These scenarios, implemented nationwide, diffusing current, concentrated vegetable production, are evaluated in the context of land availability constraints and two critical environmental burdens: groundwater overdraft and fertilizer-related PM2.5 emissions. Broadly across the conterminous US metros, scenarios find few significant land constraints and reveal net environmental benefits to both groundwater overdraft and fertilizer-related PM2.5 emissions in 11%–55% of metros (scenario-dependent). The model also reveals where relocalization of vegetable farming would exacerbate existing environmental vulnerabilities. Such spatially disaggregated nationwide urban agriculture localization models can inform environmentally friendly urban agricultural planning across US metro regions.",

      "description": "Rising global temperatures increase the potential for heat-related adverse impacts, while economic growth, by enabling greater adoption of air conditioning, can help reduce them. This makes it unclear in which countries the net effect will lead to a worsening or easing of these potential impacts as the climate and economies change. We define a Cooling Deficit Index as the product of cooling degree days and the fraction of the population without air conditioning to indicate the extent to which high temperatures are experienced without access to cooling. We used this index to investigate the relationship between global warming, economic growth, and the fraction of population exposed to high temperatures without the benefits of air conditioning. We find that populations in lower-income countries tend to experience the greatest number of high-temperature days without access to cooling and are likely to face the largest increases in such days as global temperatures rise. These countries would require GDP growth rates that exceed historical rates to avoid increasing numbers of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning. Reducing or reversing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth, and lowering the cost of cooling technologies could all contribute to decreasing the number of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning, particularly in low-income countries.",

      "description": "Background. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a leading global health risk. Latin American cities exhibit some of the world’s highest urban PM2.5 levels, yet studies of neighborhood-level PM2.5 exposure and associated disparities in the region are limited. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional ecological analysis of 53 041 neighborhoods across 340 cities in eight Latin American countries, leveraging the Salud Urbana en America Latina study dataset. Annual PM2.5 concentrations were derived from satellite data and linked to socioeconomic and urban characteristics. A multilevel model analyzed associations between neighborhood PM2.5 levels and neighborhood- and city-level characteristics. Results. The median annual neighborhood PM2.5 concentration was 18.49 μg m−3. Of the 256 million residents, all lived in neighborhoods with ambient PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the 2021 World Health Organization guidelines (5 μg m−3). Variability was greatest between cities (54.3% of total variance), but substantial within-city variation (26% of variance) was observed. Higher neighborhood PM2.5 levels were associated with higher neighborhood educational attainment (mean difference [MD] comparing top to bottom tertile = 0.17 μg m−3), higher neighborhood intersection density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = 0.17 μg m−3), and older cities (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = 1.45 μg m−3). Lower neighborhood PM2.5 levels were related to higher neighborhood population density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.55 μg m−3), more greenness (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.76 μg m−3), and larger distance from city centers (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.86 μg m−3). Conclusions. Neighborhoods with higher PM2.5 concentrations tended to have higher educational attainment, more intersections, and be located in older cities, while lower concentrations were associated with denser populations, more green space, and greater distance from city centers. Our findings reveal important within-city heterogeneity in PM2.5 and the factors associated with it, suggesting strategies to mitigate air pollution within cities.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae2140",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Carbon sequestration in arable soils is gaining increasing attention in global policymaking initiatives for climate-change mitigation. Large-scale assessments of soil organic carbon development in arable land are affected by the scarcity of reliable time series of soil organic carbon monitoring data and often fail to replicate observed trends or appreciate any effects induced by changes in soil management. This study quantifies C loss from contemporary soil management on specialist crop farms in the EU and the potential societal benefits from C sequestration and avoided C loss due to improved management. Our analysis is based on an evidence pool of 214 independent long-term time series of soil organic carbon measurements spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and soil types, and considers the implementation of reduced tillage, organic amendments, soil cover during winter, and crop rotations. Overall, we estimate the potential for C sequestration from improved soil management on specialist crop farms, representing 40% of all the arable land in the EU, to be 48 ( 15) million tonnes CO2 equivalents yearly, which corresponds to 17% ( 8) of the target for additional carbon removals in the soil and forest sinks under the Fit for 55 package. In addition, our results show high spatial variability in C losses due to current soil management practices and potential C sequestration from improvements. The annual climate-change mitigation value per unit of land with improved management shows a four-fold variation across countries, with Finland exhibiting the highest value and Cyprus the lowest. This demonstrates that a C payment eco-scheme should be adjusted spatially to achieve cost-effective soil organic carbon sequestration in arable soils in the EU.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae21f3",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Satellite observations have traditionally associated tropical cyclones (TCs) with phytoplankton blooms through elevated chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations, yet this relationship masks complex underlying ecological processes. Through a integration of satellite data and in-situ bio-optical measurements, we reveal a counterintuitive ecological response to TC ‘Chaba’ in 2022 that challenges conventional understanding. While satellite-detected Chla concentrations increased and phytoplankton division rates accelerated following TC passage, we surprisingly documented simultaneous declines in phytoplankton biomass and carbon-to-chlorophyll (C:Chl) ratios. Our analysis demonstrates that physiological regulation, rather than biomass accumulation, dominated high-Chla zones during and after TC disturbance, with C:Chl anomalies contributing over 60% to elevated Chla areas. This research presents a paradigm-shifting scenario: phytoplankton biomass began accumulating initiated pre-TC, yet increased loss rates during/after TC actually reduced phytoplankton biomass despite enhanced division rates. The fundamental decoupling between TC-induced Chla enhancement and phytoplankton biomass dynamics we document has profound implications for oceanic carbon cycling models and climate predictions, necessitating a recalibration of how we interpret satellite Chla signals in storm-affected marine ecosystems.",

      "title": "Are the alternative ecosystem states produced by positive fire-flammability feedbacks reversible?",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae18e7",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Forest communities that have a positive flammability feedback to fire can enter a ‘landscape trap’ if disturbance levels are too frequent. It is not known whether this landscape trap constitutes an alternative stable state, or whether a forest can return to its original state when disturbance levels are reduced. Here, we examine a likely landscape trap caused by the frequent burning of a 528 343 ha forest environment in Australia and previously shown to have a positive fire-flammability feedback. We ask whether the now flammable landscape can be returned to its original low-flammability state, or if the transition is irreversible in the warming climate. Using site-specific empirical models of biophysical and climatic influences on fire frequency, we predict fire frequency up to the year 2100 for three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) in the context of different management approaches. A warming climate primarily increased wildfire area in our study area by increasing the frequency of synoptic changes, likely reflecting increased rates of escape from suppression firing efforts. Declining winter rainfall had the opposite effect, reducing wildfire area consistent with trends in other seasonally dry environments. The overall effect of warming was therefore a small but significant increase in wildfire area that was more severe under higher GHG emission scenarios. In contrast, removing prescribed burning and incentives for suppression firing had an effect size 2–5 times larger than did the increasing emissions scenarios, demonstrating that the landscape trap was reversible even under the worst-case emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). Correcting fire management policies immediately reduced annual fire area by 87%, of which 77% was prescribed fire, and 43% of the remaining wildfire proportion was a by-product of the two policies. This allowed forests to escape their flammable age range, reversing a landscape trap. Our study is the first to demonstrate that such states are reversible.",

      "description": "Marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) implementations can potentially remove 1–15 Gt CO2 yr−1, which encompasses the minimum requirement removal of CDR in 2050 to limit warming below 2 °C by 2100. Despite their potential, mCDR represents only a tiny fraction of currently deployed CDR methods. Their implementations require not only a comprehensive understanding of the marine processes involved, but also a robust monitoring for their effectiveness and potential environmental impacts. In this work, we surveyed the mCDR scientific literature to identify measurable indicators for quantitative information across different ecosystems and methods used for monitoring the carbon removed and environmental side-effects, and explore the main common challenges. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol PRISMA: the search queries were established, and the literature search and criteria for inclusion/exclusion were transparently defined. Our results reveal the lack of a direct linkage from the mCDR-induced rates of chemical and biological changes to the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere and the magnitude of associated environmental side-effects. The heterogeneity of marine biogeochemical and ecological processes in time and space, together with the propagation of biogeochemical signals in an open system, represent the most common challenge reported for the monitoring approaches. Our results show that we are in need of indicators that provide reliable quantification of CO2 removal rates and information on environmental side-effects. Finally, based on our gap analysis, we provide monitoring recommendations, such as the use of common metrics and the baseline establishment. Currently, the lack of standardized indicators and monitoring procedures inhibits the verification, and hence, creates risks for further investment and prevents the entering of mCDRs in existing carbon certificate trading systems, hindering the long term growth of this sector.",

      "description": "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) significantly regulate sea surface height (SSH) variability in northern IO through equatorial and coastal waveguides. However, the phase-dependent relationship between concurrent ENSO-IOD events and equatorial-coastal waveguides remains unclear. Long-term SSH observations reveal two distinct waveguide modes during autumn-winter: an eastern mode propagating from eastern IO to Bay of Bengal (BOB), and a western mode extending from central IO to Arabian Sea (AS). These modes exhibit significant coherence in central IO exclusively during concurrent ENSO-IOD events, with stronger SSH anomalies occurring during positive phase. We identify a complete wave-mediated pathway in which equatorial Kelvin-coastal Kelvin waveguide interacts with equatorial Rossby-coastal Kelvin waveguide in central IO, transmitting SSH signal from eastern IO through BOB to AS coast. These results establish a dynamical framework linking ENSO-IOD phases to waveguide connectivity, improving predictability of climate-driven air–sea variability in northern IO.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Increased CO2 and anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) coexist in the atmosphere with opposite radiative effects. Their resultant climate responses may not fully offset each other, leading to some nonlinear changes, particularly in summer precipitation over East Asia (EA). However, how the coexistence of CO2 and AAs causes the nonlinear effect on EA precipitation remain unclear. Through analyses of fully coupled model simulations, this study shows that when both forcings are included, the precipitation over North China in July–August decreases less than the linear combination of the changes induced by individual forcings, indicating a nonlinear increase of precipitation. These nonlinear changes over EA likely originate from the Arctic and North Atlantic region. Specifically, the Arctic sea-ice sensitivity to the CO2-induced warming is higher than that to the AA-induced cooling, leading to a large increase of sea ice concentration over the East Siberian–Beaufort Seas in the nonlinear effect. This can excite an anomalous atmospheric Rossby wave propagating southeastward into the North Atlantic, which increases low cloudiness to cool the surface over the midlatitude North Atlantic. This cooling subsequently generates an anomalous Rossby wave train pattern across Eurasia with two branches propagating toward EA. The concurring circulation changes over EA ultimately result in nonlinear precipitation changes there. This study suggests that the nonlinear climate response in the high latitudes can remotely induce nonlinear changes in the lower latitudes and highlights the need to consider nonlinear effects in analyzing externally forced climate changes over EA.",
