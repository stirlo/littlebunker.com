      "description": "Agricultural systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are often characterized by low agrodiversity and high vulnerability to climate change, both of which can compromise food security and livelihoods. Many neglected and underutilized plant species (NUS) are known for their nutritional value and climate resilience, presenting a potential solution to conserve agrodiversity and contribute to local livelihoods and food security. However, NUS is commonly used as an umbrella term, obscuring potential differentiation between NUS systems in terms of their characteristics and socioeconomic performance. Here we characterize NUS production systems in three regions of Burkina Faso, a country experiencing food insecurity, poverty and arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, where many local communities rely on NUS for their food and livelihoods. We conducted 432 in-person surveys with households cultivating NUS on farms and/or collecting from the wild. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis we identify three distinct NUS production systems: NUS cultivation on farms predominantly for market sales (Cluster 1), NUS collection from the wild predominantly for market sales (Cluster 2), and NUS collection from the wild predominantly for self-consumption (Cluster 3). Through propensity score matching we identify that households in Cluster 1 had better socioeconomic performance compared to the other two clusters across all five income and food security variables considered here. However, there are no significant differences in the socioeconomic performance of Clusters 2 and 3. Our results indicate that: (a) NUS systems are not homogenous but can have a high degree of differentiation; (b) NUS are not solely emergency resources during severe food insecurity periods, (c) many NUS producers exhibit strong market orientation. Such findings can provide nuance in the current debates on whether and how can NUS provide promising alternatives to the other more widely produced crops in SSA.",

      "title": "River flow amplification under climate change: attribution and climate-driven storylines of the winter 2023/24 UK floods",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adfdfe",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate change is expected to alter the magnitude and frequency of river floods. Post-event analyses often assess the rarity of events from historical observations, and a growing number of studies attempt to attribute the event’s severity to anthropogenic warming. Recent studies also advocate for the creation of ‘what if’ event storylines to explore the consequences if an observed event turned out to be worse. However, few studies have harmonized these different approaches when conducting retrospective analyses of hydrological extremes. Climate change attribution including river flows also remains rare. Here, a framework for post-event analyses of hydrological extremes is demonstrated using the winter half-year 2023/24 UK river flooding as a case study. Persistent high river flows were observed across the UK and western Europe, following on from notable winter floods in 2013/14, 2015/16 and 2019/20. The ‘ClimaMeter’ analogue-based attribution suggests that a 6 month period with similar atmospheric circulation patterns to the observed winter half-year 2023/24 has become warmer and wetter (by an average 8.8%) in 1945–2021 compared with 1850–1925. Monthly river flow reconstructions extended back to 1850 show that river flows during the analogue periods in the recent past have also become 13.5% higher. Applying the UNSEEN approach by pooling seasonal hindcasts show the potential for river flows to be 46% higher than the baseline in a worst-case storyline. Finally, hydrological simulations driven by a single-model initial-condition large ensemble suggest that when accounting for internal variability, a robust climate signal in winter half-year river flows has emerged for some areas but may remain concealed until the mid-21st century and beyond. Our results contribute to the use of storyline approaches in post-event analysis and highlight the changing risk of winter flooding in the UK. This framework can be applied to future hydrological extremes both in the UK and elsewhere to inform long-term planning for climate adaptation.",

      "title": "Exploring net-zero emissions pathways for Africa across different timelines: an integrated assessment modeling",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Understanding how net-zero emissions timelines affect sustainable development is essential for climate planning in Africa. We apply the Global Change Analysis Model to explore the continent’s energy–land–water systems under four scenarios: a business-as-usual (BAU) and three net-zero scenarios targeting 2050 (NZ50), 2070 (NZ70), and 2100 (NZ100). Our analysis quantifies how the pace of decarbonization influences Africa’s interconnected energy, land, and water systems. Without new climate policy (BAU), Africa’s net CO2 emissions could increase by nearly six-fold; from 1.8 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2020 to 10.4 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2100. All net-zero scenarios constrain this growth, with NZ50, NZ70, and NZ100 achieving net-zero emissions by their respective target years through deployment of multiple carbon dioxide removal approaches (e.g. BECCS). Across all scenarios, primary energy supply expands, but its composition shifts under net-zero conditions. Over 2020–2100, renewables account for an average of 49%–53% of primary energy in the net-zero cases, displacing fossil fuels. Net-zero pathways also drive land-use shifts, reducing cropland area by 29%–31% and lowering water demand for food crops by 14%–15%, while increasing water use for BECCS (∼0.9 km3 yr−1 in NZ50). These land constraints raise staple food prices, averaging $1.16 kg−1 in NZ50—about 96% above BAU—with the steepest increase in Western Africa. In terms of mitigation cost, NZ50 is the most expensive pathway ($78 tCO2−1), compared to $68 tCO2−1 in NZ100. While earlier action enables deeper emissions cuts and faster clean energy transitions, it also imposes higher economic and resource trade-offs. Delayed net-zero deadlines reduce near-term disruption but result in higher cumulative emissions. Given Africa’s development context, we argue that net-zero timelines must balance technical feasibility with economic realities and social justice.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Skillful prediction of Sahel summer rainfall (SSR) is critical for mitigating hydrometeorological disasters in this vulnerable climate hotspot. In this study, we employ observational analysis from 1950–2023 to show that the sea surface temperature interhemispheric dipole in winter (SSTIDw) has a strong influence on SSR. A positive SSTIDw anomaly-marked by relatively warmer Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures-persists through spring to summer and leads to persistent negative surface pressure anomalies and anomalous cyclonic circulation. This intensifies the Saharan heat low and reinforces anomalous westerly and southwesterly flows across the Atlantic and the Guinea Coast, enhancing moisture flux convergence and rainfall in the Sahel. Based on this relationship, we develop an SSTIDw-based linear regression model that skillfully captures SSR characteristics. These findings highlight the multi-month lead time predictability of SSR, which is critical for climate-informed decision making in the Sahel.",

      "title": "Global energy and carbon emissions of irrigation and fertilizers management for closing crop yield gaps",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adfbfd",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Yield gaps present a key opportunity to meet the increasing global food demand. Defined as the difference between actual and attainable crop yields, they can be reduced by expanding irrigation and increasing nutrient inputs—strategies whose land, water, and nutrient requirements have been quantified in previous studies; however, their energy consumption and emissions remain largely unknown. This study quantifies the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with yield gap closure through irrigation and fertilizer management. Our findings indicate that energy consumption for irrigation pumping, and fertilizer production under baseline scenario is 462 TWh and 1884 TWh per year, respectively. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers account for 97%, 2%, and 1% of total fertilizer energy consumption. These activities contribute 552 Mt CO2e annually—154 Mt from irrigation and 398 Mt from fertilizer production. Closing the full yield gap would double annual energy consumption to 4579 TWh with emissions of 1.1 Gt CO2e, equivalent to 3% of global energy consumption and 2% of total GHG emissions in 2020. Although closing 75% or 50% of the yield gap would reduce energy use and GHG emissions, countries such as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and several in Sub-Saharan Africa would still face disproportionate burdens, requiring over 15% of their national energy consumption and more than 5% of their total GHG emissions to achieve the full yield gap closure. These findings reveal pronounced regional disparities in agricultural productivity, energy demands, and environmental trade-offs, underscoring the need for locally tailored strategies to strengthen food system resilience, while also advancing low-carbon energy infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel dependence, and enhancing energy security.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Balancing ecosystem service supply and demand is essential for regional sustainable development. The designation of National Key Ecological Function Zones (NKEFZs) serves as a critical policy tool to strengthen ecological regulation. This study evaluates four key ecosystem services—water provision (WP), crop production (CP), carbon storage (CS), and habitat quality (HQ) —in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2022, analyzing supply-demand surpluses and deficits, spatial-temporal dynamics, and the policy impact of NKEFZs using a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The results show that the supply-demand balance exhibits notable spatial heterogeneity: (1) WP follows a ‘southern surplus–northern deficit’ pattern, CP and HQ show a ‘western surplus–eastern balance’ structure, and CS presents a ‘western surplus–eastern deficit’ configuration. (2) Temporally, from 2005 to 2022, the WP index rose from 0.12 to 0.30, CP increased from 0.63 to 0.90, CS declined from −0.03 to −0.38 despite a reduced deficit extent, and HQ remained stable though deficits expanded in eastern urban areas. (3) Comprehensive spatial-temporal analysis shows that surpluses are concentrated in western regions, while deficits dominate central and eastern cities, with most eastern and western areas improving, in contrast to declining trends in central cities; the province-wide average index rose from 0.45 to 0.51. (4) The DID results confirm that the NKEFZs policy significantly improved the balance of ecosystem services, with the effect remaining robust after multiple tests. This study offers a scientific basis for optimizing ecological protection policies and advancing sustainability through improved ecosystem service management.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Brazilian Amazon Forest is experiencing alterations in water fluxes driven by agriculture expansion and climate change, which affect land-atmosphere interactions and precipitation recycling. Evapotranspiration (ET) is central to understand these processes, as it regulates water transport across the Amazon. However, its long-term responses to ongoing climate change and human activities remain poorly understood. This study conducted a multi-scale analysis of ET trends from basin to local scale in the most deforested region of the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a remote sensing-based model (geeSEBAL) from 1990 to 2022 to assess deforestation and climate change effects on ET. Our results indicate that overall ET in the Amazon arc of deforestation has increased by 11% during the dry season despite significant forest removal, largely due to the contribution of intact forests and global warming feedback. While these findings suggest a forest response to a changing climate, they also highlight a critical vulnerability that is exacerbated by the threat of ongoing deforestation. With projected warmer future climate and extended dry seasons, our results emphasize the complex interplay between water recycling and climate change in the world’s largest rainforest, with significant ecological and water security implications.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Moisture recycling is a fundamental process that sustains regional precipitation, supports ecosystem stability, and delivers critical ecosystem services at both local and global scales. In the Amazon, deforestation disrupts this process, altering moisture source and sink dynamics of areas in the region and impacting its overall moisture recycling function. This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of moisture recycling by assessing the responses of moisture sources and sinks to deforestation across different time lags, focusing on the Amazon’s contribution to and dependency on its moisture recycling regime. We used the UTrack moisture tracking model and high-resolution deforestation data from MapBiomas to quantify changes in dependency and contribution of the Amazon over a 22 year period (2000–2021). Our findings revealed high heterogeneity in moisture recycling patterns across the Amazon. We also found that deforestation affects both immediate and delayed moisture recycling responses, with mid- and long-term responses (13–48 months and 49–72 months) more pronounced than immediate responses (1–12 months). Deforestation is associated with a decreasing evaporation contribution of the Amazon to its moisture recycling regime as moisture sources and an increasing dependency for precipitation as moisture sinks. These results underscore the persistent and delayed effects of deforestation on the hydrological cycle of this important biome.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Ubiquitous mesoscale eddy-front systems are hotspots of carbon export, yet how their decay phase regulates the biological pump in strongly stratified oceans remains unknown. Utilizing ship-based observations from a decaying cyclonic eddy off southeastern Sri Lanka, we reveal that while both the eddy interior and frontal zones exhibit elevated phytoplankton biomass due to different nutrient supply mechanisms, they drive divergent particulate organic carbon (POC) transfer efficiency: enhanced within the eddy but reduced at the front. Subsurface hydrodynamic processes and particle size distributions shaped contrasting export efficiency. During the decay phase, downwelling, weaker stratification, and larger particles inside the eddy promoted efficient POC transfer to depth. Conversely, frontal upwelling, strong stratification induced by water-mass convergence, and finer particles attenuated export. These findings demonstrate that decaying eddy-front systems exhibit spatially heterogeneous carbon sequestration efficiencies, challenging assumptions of uniform attenuation rates and underscoring the need to resolve life-stage dynamics in biological pump assessments.",
