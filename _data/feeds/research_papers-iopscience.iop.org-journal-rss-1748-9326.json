      "description": "Sustainable agricultural intensification requires a precise understanding of how land use decisions influence soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration under varying environmental conditions. We apply causal machine learning to evaluate the heterogeneous impact of winter wheat-based rotations on SOC at the field-level across Lithuania. Using a nationwide dataset collected over five years (2018–2022), including crop types, management practices, soil properties, and environmental conditions, we estimate how the effects of winter wheat-based rotation vary across space and climate. Our results indicate that winter wheat generally enhances SOC levels, but its effectiveness is modulated by climate. Cooler regions experience higher SOC gains, whereas warmer regions show diminished or even negative effects. Future climate projections suggest that the potential for winter wheat carbon sequestration may decline under high-emission scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of localized agricultural strategies that account for climate variability to maximize SOC sequestration and ensure long-term soil sustainability.",

      "title": "Are there lightning fires in the Brazilian Amazon?",

      "description": "The Brazilian Amazon contains approximately 40% of the world’s tropical rainforest and plays a critical role in preserving biodiversity and regulating water, energy and carbon cycles. However, deforestation and increasingly frequent droughts, heatwaves and wildfires threaten these rainforests. Amazonian fires are generally assumed to be entirely anthropogenic, which has led to lightning-ignited fires being underexplored. Here, we present the first detailed assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of lightning-ignited fires in the Amazon rainforest to elucidate the role of lightning and human ignitions in shaping Amazon fire dynamics. To do this, we matched cloud-to-ground lightning strokes from the Global Lightning Dataset (GLD360) with individual fire events between 2019 and 2024 to obtain a probability of lightning ignition for each fire. We also calculated a human-ignition probability index using proximity to roads, waterways, and human land cover as proxies for human activity. By combining both probabilistic indices with ground-observed lightning ignitions from eight protected areas, we could optimize the threshold that determines if an ignition is more likely to be caused by lightning or human activities. We estimate that in the Brazilian Amazon, lightning caused on average 0.2%–0.4% of all fires each year (234–407 ignitions per year) and 1.1%–1.2% of the annually burned area (1226–1358 km2 per year) between 2019 and 2024. More than 89% of these fires occurred in the late dry season between August and November, peaking in September and October. Despite lightning-ignited fires contributing a small proportion of all Amazonian fires, they constitute over 25% of the fires in identified grid clusters in parts of the states of Pará (particularly in the Breves region), Amazonas, and Rondônia. This study provides the first estimation of the role of natural ignitions in Amazon fire dynamics and a scientific basis for understanding their contribution within the region.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Land surface temperature provides a fingerprint of the surface energy balance. Under similar radiative forcing, particularly during daytime and clear-sky conditions, its temporal variability is expected to be coupled to surface conditions such as availability of soil moisture and plant functional conditions. In this study, we use Earth observations to identify regions with a strong interannual co-variability between the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature and surface soil moisture. Land surface temperature is taken from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Applications Facility on Land Surface Analysis and soil moisture from the Copernicus Climate Change Service for the period 2004–2023 over the 0° Meteosat Second Generation region, encompassing Africa and Europe. We introduce a new metric to quantify the soil moisture-temperature interannual co-variability in the satellite data, which is then applied to evaluate the fifth reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ERA5). Earth observations and ERA5 show similar spatial co-variability patterns across much of the domain, highlighting regions of transition between climate zones. However, ERA5 shows weaker co-variability in regions with large interannual vegetation variability. These findings suggest that accurately capturing the interannual variability of land surface temperature and its co-variability with soil moisture, in regions with large vegetation variability, may require a dynamic representation of vegetation status, beyond the mean annual cycles currently implemented in ERA5.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The distribution and fate of marine microplastics have become central concerns in ocean science, yet the literature remains strongly biased toward coastal and surface environments. This review presents a systematic analysis of over 40 000 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science between 1980 and 2024, classified according to their disciplinary scope, marine environment, and climate-inspired framing (diagnosis, mitigation, adaptation). Our results reveal persistent structural imbalances: biology dominates thematically, beaches and coastlines dominate spatially, and diagnostic efforts far outnumber mitigation or adaptation studies. Crucially, the deep ocean—despite comprising the majority of marine volume and likely acting as a long-term reservoir for microplastics—remains severely underrepresented. Studies that include sampling below 1000 m are rare, and most lack specific geographic metadata. While the growth in microplastics literature is robust, its conceptual and spatial coverage remains narrow. We argue for a strategic expansion of research to include the full depth and breadth of the ocean, and for increased interdisciplinarity to reduce current uncertainties in global plastic budgets and support evidence-based mitigation efforts.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The global energy transition is accelerating demand for critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, and copper. Although essential for low-carbon technologies, the extractions of these mineral resources create significant socio-environmental costs. The 11 Letters curated in this Focus Issue of Environmental Research Letters bring interdisciplinary perspectives to highlight the social and environmental complexities of energy-transition mineral extraction. There is a rich diversity of geographies, commodity types, technology uses, methodological approaches, and temporal and spatial scales represented in this issue. They collectively shed light on the complex interactions between extraction, justice, and sustainability concerns for some of the most remote and marginalized frontline regions globally. They also reveal both the urgency and the opportunity for systemic change in how societies govern, monitor, and participate in resource extraction. This editorial synthesizes these contributions, identifies emerging insights, and outlines a forward-looking agenda to help inform discussions across policy and practice on a just and responsible energy transition.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae384b",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Gridded climate data products have facilitated research in climate and ecology by providing meteorological data continuously across large spatial scales. However, the sensitivity of scientific outcomes to dataset choice remains poorly understood, and evaluation using station-based records can favor datasets built heavily on weather stations. Here, we evaluate seven high-resolution daily gridded datasets covering the contiguous United States using independent meteorology from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, with a focus on the implications of dataset choice for process-based tree growth modeling. We find that gridded products tend to capture temperature accurately while consistently overestimating the magnitude and frequency of precipitation and its extremes. Moreover, datasets vary in how they define a ‘day,’ which significantly affects temporal alignment with FLUXNET2015 observations. Despite differences among the datasets, the interannual variability in tree ring simulations is insensitive to dataset choice, likely because daily-scale biases are averaged out through accumulated growth across several months. However, inaccuracies in temperature and precipitation can significantly bias modeled xylem cell production, with systematically higher annual precipitation in the gridded datasets leading to greater xylem production compared to simulations using in situ data. Our results suggest that model applications, especially those that integrate to time scales longer than one day, are likely insensitive to climate dataset choice, but applications that are sensitive to daily climate variations or to absolute climate values need to carefully consider biases in gridded climate products.",

      "title": "Strongly reducing sediments hinder restoration of a eutrophic coastal marine ecosystem",
      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae38fa",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Anthropogenic activities are causing deoxygenation of coastal waters leading to degradation of such ecosystems globally. In the Dutch Southwest Delta, coastal management has turned tidal waters into marine lakes. The ensuing stagnation and stratification in combination with eutrophication has caused a decline in water quality, including decreased oxygen (O2) saturation. Restoring such systems is challenging as exemplified by Lake Veere, which was reconnected to the tidal marine Eastern Scheldt, via a culvert, two decades ago. After an initial improvement, water quality strongly declined again in recent years. Here, we investigate the consequences of the restoration effort on coastal deoxygenation by leveraging existing monitoring data of oxygen, temperature, salinity, and benthic macroinvertebrates. In addition, we quantified the O2 demand of the sediment at selected sites via field measurements. Water quality monitoring data indicate that the restored tidal influence resulted in strong improvements in O2 saturation of bottom waters. However, improvements were confined to the eastern part nearby the inflow of marine water. Modelled bottom water O2 concentrations and observed benthic macroinvertebrate densities are related, and show reduced densities under low-O2, especially for less mobile infauna. This highlights the detrimental effect of deoxygenation on benthic faunal communities. Geochemical analyses reveal a very high sedimentary O2 demand, mainly caused by high concentrations of the reduced solutes ammonium and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). These solutes are toxic and are formed by anaerobic (re)mineralization of organic matter. Furthermore, low availability of easily reducible iron-oxides in the lake sediments mutes the formation of iron-sulphides, explaining high porewater H2S concentrations, and release of H2S into bottom waters. Combined, our results illustrate the challenge of restoring a coastal ecosystem by increasing lateral oxygen supply without addressing the legacy effects of eutrophication in the sediments, reemphasizing the importance of nutrient reductions in restoration strategies.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The increasing impact of tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall underscores the need to understand regional variations in its spatial distribution. Using high-resolution satellite precipitation data from 1998–2023, this study investigates changes in the spatial inhomogeneity of TC rainfall across China. Results show that TC rainfall inhomogeneity decreases significantly by about 65%, indicating a reduced rainfall in historically high-TC-rainfall areas and an increase in low-TC-rainfall areas. Regionally, this decline is mainly governed by the intra‐regional component in East China, where opposing trends between high- and low-rainfall areas have substantially reduced spatial disparities. In contrast, North China shows a marked increase in TC rainfall, accompanied by increased intra‐regional but decreased inter‐regional inhomogeneity, largely offsetting each other. Other regions exhibit minor or insignificant contributions. These spatial reorganizations of TC rainfall in East and North China are closely linked to the northward migration of TC activity in recent decades, driven by reduced landfalling TCs over Taiwan and Fujian and increased inland penetration of TCs into East and North China. The findings reveal a restructuring of TC rainfall patterns and emphasize the growing regional contrasts in TC‐related hydroclimatic impacts, providing new insights for disaster risk assessments and regional climate adaptation strategies in China.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae2b85",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, exerting a significant influence on ocean circulation and marine productivity. In the present climate, positive SAM phases enhance Ekman-driven northward nutrient transport, leading to delayed increases in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the mid-latitude South Pacific. However, the extent to which this relationship will persist under future climate change remains uncertain. Here, we investigate future changes in the SAM–Chl-a relationship using Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble simulations under the shared socioeconomic pathway3−7.0 scenario. A subset of ensemble members that successfully reproduce observed present-day SAM–Chl-a lag correlations was selected for analysis. In the historical period (1970–2014), Chl-a anomalies in the mid-latitude eastern South Pacific show a distinct peak approximately three months after positive SAM events, associated with enhanced northward nutrient transport. In contrast, future projections (2070–2100) reveal a weakened or absent lagged response, coinciding with reduced westerly wind anomalies and diminished Ekman transport. These results suggest that the SAM’s influence to regulate marine productivity in the mid-latitude South Pacific may decline under continued climate change. This has important implications for future biogeochemical dynamics and highlights the need for high-resolution modeling to better represent fine-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions.",
