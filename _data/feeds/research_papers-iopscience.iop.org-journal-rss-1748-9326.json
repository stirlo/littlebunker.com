      "description": "Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyse a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ‘Turing-evades-tipping’). Additionally, we identify a novel ‘Turing-triggers-tipping’ mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Methane super-emitter events (>100 kg methane hr−1) are prevalent across the oil and gas supply chain and are being targeted for methane mitigation policies due to their climate impacts; however, few studies have evaluated the air quality impacts and direct safety and public health risks. Here, we evaluate seven upstream oil and gas methane super-emitter events to examine the safety (explosivity) risks from methane and the short-term, noncancer health risks from benzene and other key co-emitted non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). We used airborne instrument and satellite-measured methane emissions rates to estimate hourly air concentrations of methane using US EPA’s American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD), a regulatory-grade dispersion model, and applied estimated speciated NMVOC-methane molar ratios to calculate hourly air concentrations of NMVOCs. We assessed when and where hourly modeled methane and NMVOC air concentrations exceeded national safety (0.5% methane) and state-based health (8 ppb and 53 ppb benzene) benchmarks. Large methane super-emitters (>2900 kg hr−1) had safety benchmark exceedances as far as 270 m from the source, indicating that safety risks are greatest for facility workers and nearby communities. Health benchmark exceedances were the greatest and most frequent close to the source (<300 m), but, in contrast to the safety risks, reached beyond one kilometer (1.1–19 km) for modeled methane super-emitters (210–15 800 kg hr−1), posing health risks to residents and sensitive populations. We also found that smaller methane super-emitters may pose outsized health risks: our second lowest methane emission case (539 kg hr−1) yielded the highest benzene air concentration (28 000 ppb), farthest 8 ppb benzene exceedance distance (19 km), and highest frequency of health benchmark exceedances between 1–5 km (2.6%). Our study demonstrates that policies and early detection efforts that control methane super-emitters should prioritize factors beyond methane emissions rate magnitude, such as gas composition, to provide the strongest co-benefits for public health and safety.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Human activity over the past century has greatly disrupted the natural nitrogen (N) balance, harming health and the environment. Sustainable nitrogen management requires cross-sectoral governance, but studies tracking nitrogen flows across sectors are limited. This study assesses cross-sectoral sources, flows, and sinks of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in Austria, identifying direct Nr inputs and emitting sectors. Using the ‘UNECE-Guidance Document on National Nitrogen Budgets’ and material flow analysis, we quantified Austria’s national nitrogen budget for 2015–2019. Results show the main nitrogen inflows and outflows from imports and exports in the consumer goods and chemical industries. Energy imports also contribute significantly. Some nitrogen is temporarily stored (e.g. in products) or transferred between sectors. However, not all of this N-loss is of direct environmental concern. Annually, 389 kt Nr are lost directly to the environment and causing significant environmental and economic consequences. Direct Nr inputs primarily originate from agriculture (39.3%) and energy/transport (20.7%), with around 30% from cross-border fluxes via water (13.9%) and air (16.6%). The remaining 10% stem from settlements, waste management, and industry. This study highlights the complexity of nitrogen sources and sinks in Austria and underscores the need for improvements towards reduced uncertainties in future research, including higher-resolution spatial data to account for regional variability.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf7c0",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "This study examines the unique annual cycle characteristics of tropical cyclone (TC) genesis in the South China Sea (SCS). In contrast to the TC bimodal structure in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and its unimodal pattern in the Northwestern Pacific (WNP), the SCS exhibits a distinct step-like pattern with two jumps—the first occurring from April to May and the second from July to August, with the flat condition during May–June–July. Hence, TC in SCS witnesses the surprising transition between BoB and WNP. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, the genesis potential index is applied for a quantitative assessment of large-scale environmental factors. Results indicate that in the SCS, the mid-level atmospheric relative humidity is the dominant factor driving the first TC genesis jump in May, whereas the vertical wind shear contributes to the second jump. In the WNP, the mid-level atmospheric relative humidity remains the most crucial for TC peak feature. This study advances our understanding of the unique annual cycle of TC in the SCS in comparison with the neighboring BoB and NWP, offering valuable insights to improve the forecasting skills in the region.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Old-growth forests are of high habitat value for many forest-dwelling species and of high cultural value for society. In areas with a long history of human land-use, such as in Central Europe, few old-growth forests remain, located predominately in protected areas such as national parks and wilderness areas. Protected areas safeguard old-growth forests against human land use, but not against the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Using simulation-based scenario analyses we here assessed the development of old-growth in the 21st century, using a national park in the Northern Alps as example. Under climate change, old-growth decreased by up to 21% relative to simulations under baseline climate, with decreasing size and cohesion of old-growth patches on the landscape. Climate-mediated increases in disturbance were driving the decline in old-growth forests, with a near complete loss in old-growth beyond disturbance rates of 1.5% yr−1. Conversely, structurally complex forests increased with disturbance, suggesting a decoupling of forest structure and demography in the 21st century. We conclude that climate change presents an indirect anthropogenic threat to old-growth forests in protected areas. Our findings highlight that climate impacts need to be considered explicitly in conservation planning, in order not to overestimate the effectiveness of protected areas.",

      "title": "Beyond redistribution: a framework for reparative just transitions",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf905",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Prevailing just transition proposals often assume the continuity of colonial land relations and see ‘greener’ industrial development as a pathway to prosperity for all. Our paper aligns with and aims to contribute to emerging scholarship that questions these assumptions. Through a review of interdisciplinary just transition research, we map a distinction between mainstream, critical and reparative approaches to just transitions. Mainstream perspectives, largely rooted in the global north, focus on labour justice, while critical just transition scholarship addresses intersectional injustices and amplifies grassroots perspectives, particularly from the global south. Reparative approaches extend this critique by reckoning with the interconnected historical legacies of colonialism and industrial development, though empirical examples of this approach remain sparse. To differentiate these approaches, we introduce a 5R framework for just transitions—recognition, representation, redistribution, resurgence, and (settler) responsibility—foregrounding Indigenous resurgence as a crucial yet often overlooked element of repair. To illustrate this framework, we draw on a community-directed collaboration with the Tremembé da Barra do Mundaú Indigenous community in Ceará, Brazil. We conclude by inviting environmental and social scientists to consider more historically grounded and relationally reparative just transition approaches. Such approaches are essential, though not sufficient, for realizing the more transformative aims of just transitions.",

      "title": "Tree seed dispersal modes affect forest resilience along savanna-forest boundaries",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf907",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The effects of global changes on tropical forests and savannas are manifested primarily at their boundaries. The dynamics at these forest-savanna boundaries depend on their shapes, which influence the spread of fires through the savanna landscape. How these boundaries are shaped depends on tree recruitment patterns, which differ between trees dispersed by wind and those dispersed by birds. Therefore, tree dispersal modes may have large effects on fire spread and subsequently on forest-savanna resilience. To study these effects, we developed a novel individual-based model of seed dispersal in savanna-forest ecosystems, and investigated the interactions among tree seed dispersal modes, spatial patterns of tree cover, and fire spread. We study forest resilience by measuring the maximum loss of tree cover from which the forest can recover. We find that forest recruitment rate and resilience are more sensitive to forest pattern morphology when trees are dispersed by birds than by wind. In addition, these effects are more pronounced for larger forest patches that are spaced further apart. Moreover, recruitment and resilience in bird-dispersed forests display high sensitivity to bird behavioral parameters, suggesting that the community composition of frugivorous birds may be an important indirect driver of forest resilience. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that interactions between spatial patterns of tree cover and tree dispersal modes may affect the resilience of tropical forests and savannas against tipping. Thus, efforts to understand the impact of global change on tipping points between forest and savanna should account for the effects of seed dispersal modes.",

      "title": "Toward sustainability of territorial agro-food systems in Europe: indicators for assessing alternative scenarios",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf97e",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Describing territorial agro-food systems through nitrogen flows between agriculture, livestock farming, human consumption, and external trade represents a useful basis for assessing the environmental sustainability of these systems. The concepts of circularity and self-sufficiency are often put forward in assessments to complement indicators related to environmental impacts, such as nitrogen use efficiency, environmental N surplus, N losses. Here, we use these indicators to assess the environmental performance and sustainability of the agro-food systems of 127 regions in Europe in their current state as well as under two alternative scenarios of varying degrees of structural changes designed to reach sustainability. Both scenarios consider the projected European population at 2050, a dietary change toward less animal protein (30% and 20%, instead of 57% for the reference situation, Ref 2015–2019) and are based on the widespread use of organic crop rotations and the banning of synthetic fertilizers and feed imports. An Agro-Ecology scenario (AE) exploits crop and livestock production at optimal production capacity in the current agricultural areas of each region, thus maintaining the possibility of external trade, while a Radical Simplicity of lifestyle scenario (RS), limits production to regional requirements, with excess agricultural land set aside for reforestation and rewilding. AE and RS are able to feed Europe and greatly reduce environmental losses (more than 50% for both scenarios), but some not self-sufficient regions still necessitate interregional exchanges. Full circularity is theoretically not possible; it increases from 30% (Ref) to 43% (AE). At the European scale, N-food self-sufficiency remains over 1 (2.6 for Ref, 1.6–1.2 for AE and RS), while import dependency of European regions on commercial N-import for food delivery, currently over 2.7 as a mean, drops below 0.1 in both scenarios. The results illustrate the complex relationships between self-sufficiency, circularity, and the environmental impact of territorial agro-food systems.",

      "description": "Vegetation greening trends are a critical and direct indicator to reflect photosynthetic activity of plants at the ecosystem scale. The monitoring of vegetation greening is crucial for assessing ecosystem health, sustaining biodiversity, improving soil health, and providing direction for effective environmental management. However, long-term changes in greening trends are rarely reported due to radiometric inconsistencies among different satellite sensors. Here, we used 12 machine learning algorithms to perform pixel correction on 42 years of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GIMMS NDVI data. The models exhibited high accuracy (93%–97%), yielding a robust ensemble R2 of 0.88 at the spatial scale. From 1982 to 2023, global NDVI had an increasing trend (0.0012), particularly in the high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere (>60° N), with the rate of increase accelerating since 2000. Temperature and water conditions showed significant correlations with greening trends, exhibiting spatially asymmetric effects. In addition, frequent land cover changes promoted the growth of greening trends (∼23%), which is linked to enhanced structural plasticity of vegetation. This effect has become more pronounced since 2000, with 92% of such changes occurring during this period. Anthropogenic impact may play a role in driving greening trend reductions, rather than enhancements.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The 35 °C threshold-based heatwave (HW) holds particular significance for human health, energy supply and animal welfare, serving as a critical criterion for issuing high-temperature warnings in China. However, the quantified influence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols (AA) on HW days (HWD) and cumulative intensity (HWS) remains underexplored. Here, we investigated these influences based on a threshold adjustment method and optimal fingerprint method. Using observations from 1961–2020, we found that both HWD and HWS experienced a clear increase across most of China, with the largest changes centered in eastern and northwestern China. Bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models successfully reproduced the observed changes as well as the regional differences. Anthropogenic forcing dominated by GHGs was robustly detected, with the influence of GHGs and AA successfully separated. Attribution analysis revealed that GHGs explained about 126.3% of HW changes. Constrained projections indicated that both HWD and HWS would continue to increase until 2050, even under the most optimistic low-emission scenario. Eastern China was projected to experience fast HW increase, likely due to intensified GHG emission combined with anticipated reduction in AA in the future, highlighting the urgency of developing mitigation and adaptation policies.",
