      "description": "In many water-scarce locations, cities will need to reduce their freshwater withdrawals in order to adapt to the changing climatic conditions of the Anthropocene, reduce the risks of ‘Day Zeros,’ and reduce the disruption to the global hydrological cycle. This paper shows that it is possible for water utilities to make dramatic reductions in raw water withdrawals without proportionally large increases in system-wide costs. A simulation model is built that characterizes the piped water and wastewater network of an urban water utility in a hypothetical high-income city and the costs at nodes and links of the system. This simulation model is used to estimate the effects of four interventions—leakage reduction, demand reduction, potable reuse, and desalination—on raw water withdrawals and system-wide costs. We illustrate the effects of both individual interventions and policy mixes. Compared to the assumed baseline urban water and sanitation system, policy mixes can reduce raw water withdrawals by 74% with only modest increases in system-wide costs.",

      "description": "Anticipated changes in the diurnal cloud cycle (DCC) under global warming carry significant implications for future climate predictions. However, there is a notable dearth of studies specifically focusing on DCC shifts. Here, we establish a connection between DCC and its radiative effects (DCCRE), revealing that the DCC has tended to warm the climate over the past 13 years. We found that the centroid position determines the warming or cooling effect of DCCRE, while the magnitude of the amplitude influences its strength. As global mean temperature (GMT) rises, low cloud centroid tends to shift from daytime to nighttime, enhancing nighttime warming effects and diminishing solar radiation reflection. Conversely, high clouds exhibit the opposite, reducing nighttime warming effects and displaying stronger DCCRE compared to low clouds. For each 1 °C increase in GMT, the total cloud DCCRE is expected to rise by 2.90 W m−2, mainly driven by low clouds contributing to an increase of 1.85 W m−2. This suggests that DCCRE may continue to warm the climate as GMT rises. These results indicate that the changes in DCC are significant for understanding climate variability. However, it should be noted that these findings are based on short-term regression analysis and further research is needed to determine whether they are related to long-term responses.",

      "description": "Extreme heat is a growing public health threat. In the United States (US), the National Weather Service (NWS) issues alerts ahead of forecast periods of extreme heat. However, the behavioral impact of official heat alerts remains poorly understood at actionable scales, and their real-world effectiveness has been difficult to quantify. We used anonymized, county-level Google search data on the proportion of searches classified into eight heat-associated categories, aggregated daily across 2581 US counties from May to September 2023. We implemented a time-stratified case-crossover method using conditional Poisson models to quantify the association between the proportion of heat-related internet searches and (a) daily maximum temperature and (b) NWS heat alerts, adjusting for same-day county-specific temperature percentiles. We further evaluated how associations varied spatially and temporally within the season. Across all counties, searches for heat stroke/exhaustion were 3.60 (95% CI, 3.38–3.85) times higher when comparing the 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures to the 1st percentile. Air-conditioning searches were 2.47 (2.43–2.51) times higher. Exposure–response curves rose steeply above the 80th percentile except for public swimming and cooling center queries. On heat alert days, heat-related searches were 1.27 (1.26, 1.28) times higher relative to matched non-alert days. Results varied by region. However, effect modification was pronounced: early-summer alerts (May–June) elicited stronger responses than late-summer alerts (July–September) in all heat-related search categories except cooling centers. Our findings suggest that heat alerts trigger meaningful, real-time behavioral responses during heatwaves, particularly in early summer and historically cooler regions. High-resolution internet search data offer a promising tool for evaluating public engagement with risk communication and can provide local officials guidance for further optimizing messaging strategies.",

      "description": "Rice production failure is a major threat to food security and supply chain resilience across India. In this paper, we examine future rice production failure risks across India by integrating down-scaled climate projections with machine learning models that capture complex crop-climate interactions. First, we identify key drivers of historical crop failures and demonstrate the critical role of monthly weather variability. We then use our historically-trained ML models to project future production failure risk across India, linking spatial changes in failure risk with projected future weather distributions and exploratory scenarios of changes in irrigation access. Our findings indicate that district-level risks of rice production failures in India are projected to increase (26% average) under future climate change across all shared socioeconomic pathways in the near (2025–2054) and far (2055–2084) future. Our analysis demonstrates that expanding irrigation access could play a vital role in mitigating these risks, with substantial risk reductions observed in high-vulnerability regions. These insights provide actionable information for policymakers aiming to enhance agricultural resilience, identifying priority areas where adaptive measures, particularly irrigation improvements, can most effectively reduce vulnerability to climate-driven production risks.",

      "description": "Climate change (CC) is already affecting Canada’s hydrologic cycle, posing challenges for water management in mining operations and increasing associated environmental and social risks. However, there is limited research that quantifies the extent of anticipated CC impacts across Canadian watersheds with active mining. This paper aims to fill that gap by assessing CC impacts on key hydroclimatic variables important for Canada’s mine water management. Baseline conditions were established for six key variables: annual precipitation, 24 h intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) precipitation, 10 d extreme precipitation, annual mean temperature, hydrologic drought index like Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI), and annual snow depth. Date sources included Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Future CC projections were generated using ECCC’s transformation equation for 24 h IDF precipitation, the quantile delta mapping (QDM) method for 10 d extreme precipitation, and downscaled, bias corrected CMIP5 ensemble projections for the remaining variables. The assessment considered two greenhouse emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and three future timeframes (2020s, 2050s, 2080s). The study reveals projected temperature increases within the case study watersheds of 2.4 °C–3.5 °C by the 2050s and 3 °C–7 °C by the 2080s under median or 50th percentile (p50) conditions. Annual precipitation is expected to rise by 11%–16% (2050s) and 15%–28% (2080s), with more intense shorter-duration events under p50 conditions. For example, the current 100 year 24 h IDF storm is expected to occur more frequently, decreasing to a 27–49 year return period by the 2050s and a 10–40 year return period by the 2080s. Annual average snow depth is projected to decline by 21%–73% (2050s) and 24%–89% (2080s) under p50 conditions. These findings highlights that water management in Canada’s mining regions is set to face escalating hydrological changes under a changing climate. Effective management strategies are therefore essential to prevent intensified environmental and social risks.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Novel carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches are essential to address climate change. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is being considered to enhance the ocean’s capacity as an atmospheric carbon sink. It is widely recognised that responsible development and deployment of marine-based CDR requires effective engagement with local stakeholders. This article considers how stakeholders could actively participate in OAE, enhancing their agency and identifying pathways to incorporate their skills and knowledge into research and deployment activities. Adopting a place-based approach in Tasmania, Australia, we interviewed 23 participants and asked them how they might contribute to future OAE activities in/around this island state. Participants saw themselves contributing to one or more activity-based themes: knowledge creation, regulatory oversight, safeguarding values, and/or stakeholder networking. While some responses were predictable (i.e. government representatives adopting regulatory roles), others were unexpected, highlighting the importance of proactively engaging with stakeholders. Several participants identified the need for further support to effectively perform their roles, including expert advice and access to resources. Capacity assessments can evaluate the ability of local stakeholders to play an active role in OAE activities and thus inform strategies to bolster capacity through learning and infrastructure development. We recommend integrating capacity assessments into OAE/marine CDR stakeholder engagement strategies. Further research is needed to develop and implement capacity assessments for OAE and other marine CDR approaches.",

      "description": "Globally, solar energy has supplanted fossil fuels as the predominant source of clean energy. Scholars have been calling for techno-ecological synergies that minimizing unintended environmental consequences; however, empirical evidence is largely missing in the existing literature. Taking the world’s largest photovoltaic (PV) power plant as a demonstration, combining remote sensing images with field data, we actively used the spatiotemporal dynamic analysis, gross ecosystem products accounting method and statistical analysis methods to show techno-ecological synergies for electricity generation and ecological recovery. Specifically, our analyses reveal that (1) PV panels reduced surface albedo. The albedo of three broad spectral bands decreased by >15% in PV area; (2) comparing to areas between and outside the PV areas, areas under the PV panels enhanced vegetation cover by 61.86% (absolute coverage of 38.22%) and 131.80% (absolute coverage of 56.86%), unit area above-ground biomass by 133.71% (119 g) and 235.48% (146 g), and plant height by 31.02% (17.36 cm) and 45.58% (22.96 cm), respectively. Nevertheless, PV panels exerted a negative impact on soil organic matter but did not significantly affect other soil and vegetation indicators (i.e. soil water content, vegetation nitrogen content, and vegetation biodiversity, etc); and (3) PV panels improved ecosystem services. Specifically, from 2010 to 2020, among the four ecosystem regulating services, carbon sequestration and oxygen release increased by 178.46% (70.92 t km−2 and 51.58 t km−2), sand fixation by 13.76% (3920.19 t km−2), and soil retention by 4.16% (467.02 t km−2), respectively. Our study demonstrates a potentially sustainable mode in desert areas that supports vertical multiple land uses, improves the surface ecological environment while harnesses solar energy. With better understanding and management of the coupled human-natural energy systems, including the light allocation between PV panels, the selection of appropriate vegetation types beneath panels, and effective management, it is promising that there will be more techno-ecological synergies worldwide.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Observations have been debated as portraying a multimodal distribution of tropical tree cover, even in regions with identical mean annual precipitation (MAP). Previous studies have discussed whether such multimodality is evidence of alternative stable states, which would indicate that tropical forests may irreversibly transition to a savanna-like state when deforestation and climate forcing reach a tipping point. However, doubts have been raised regarding this interpretation. Alternative hypotheses invoke heterogeneous environmental conditions related to soil properties, climate parameters beyond MAP, or human activity. Here, we explore the possibility that the influence of multiple environmental parameters can create multimodality in monostable systems when projected onto one dimension. We show that this situation can indeed occur, even if the system’s only equilibrium state depends monotonically on the parameters, and even if the parameter values have Gaussian distributions. Such a situation would imply that tree cover may respond linearly to forcing, without any abrupt behavior, regardless of multiple peaks in the tree cover distribution. However, when considering ecologically more realistic parameterizations of tree cover, as used in process-based vegetation models, we find that multiple tree cover modes are more difficult to obtain in the absence of alternative stable states. The reason is that environmental conditions do not affect tree cover directly and independently from each other, but indirectly by affecting tree productivity and mortality. Consequently, a coexistence of forest and savanna in these models is only possible when imposing environmental parameters that are bimodal themselves. Motivated by this finding, we analyze the observed distribution of several relevant environmental parameters in South America, and find that none of them suggests a multi-modal tree cover distribution. Our results hence emphasize that possible tipping dynamics are a concern, but also call for improved estimates of tropical tree cover distribution and the role of fire-vegetation interactions.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using neural general circulation model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can generate 100 simulation days in ∼8 min with a single graphics processing unit while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July–November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990–2023 (r = ∼0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observed sub-basin TC tracks (p < 0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) (p < 0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.",
