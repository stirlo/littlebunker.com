      "description": "Global climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) interact to create unique urban microclimates. However, how these interactions affect trees in urban parks is poorly understood. Using multi-source satellite fusion, we observe that New York City parks are experiencing delays in the start of the growing season, especially in medium-sized parks. Notably, warming effects are more pronounced in park trees near the edges, where urban heat is stronger. This delay is explained by a physiological mechanism: warmer winters reduce chilling accumulation and increase the heat requirements for leaf development, disrupting the balance between chilling and heat needed for spring leaf-out. Medium-sized parks are especially vulnerable to urban heat due to their structural characteristics such as higher edge-to-area ratios and limited interior buffer zones, both of which amplify edge effects. These findings demonstrate that climate change, compounded by the UHI effect, is altering tree phenology in urban parks, with implications for urban ecosystem adaptation and management.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of high-temperature ozone suppression in Eastern China: a meteorological perspective",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Ozone (O3) is a typical secondary photochemical pollutant, whose production typically increases under high temperature and radiation. However, emerging observational evidences reveal a notable alteration in the O3-temperature relationship under extremely heat conditions (referred to as O3 suppression) in 20%–30% cities of China, yet the underlying mechanisms and driving forces remain unclear. This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the meteorological mechanisms driving high-temperature O3 suppression in Eastern China, with particular emphasis on regional disparities between suppression and non-suppression areas. Our analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns of O3 suppression across major Chinese regions. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions exhibit significant O3 suppression, with the O3-temperature relationship decreasing by 3–5 μg m−3 °C−1 at high temperatures. In contrast, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region rarely illustrates this phenomenon. Through integrated statistical analysis and machine learning approaches, we identified radiation, relative humidity (RH), and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) as the key meteorological drivers. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that RH was the dominant factor accounting for regional differences in O3 suppression, primarily owing to the contrasting effects of dry heat (BTH) and wet heat (YRD and PRD). PBLH emerged as a secondary influential factor that modulates O3 concentration through the competitive effects of diffusion and transport processes. Cluster analysis further revealed that the occurrence frequency of inhibitory meteorological conditions (high RH and low PBLH) during high-temperature days in the YRD and PRD regions (25%–35%) significantly exceeded that in the BTH region (2%). This study provides crucial insights into the regional disparities in meteorological mechanisms underlying high-temperature O3 suppression and offers valuable scientific support for region-specific O3 pollution control strategies in the context of climate warming and increasingly frequent heatwaves.",

      "title": "Timing of peat initiation across the central Congo Basin",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The central Congo Basin contains the world’s most extensive tropical peatland complex, spanning 16.7 million hectares. Until now, radiocarbon dating of basal peats has been limited to 14 samples with poor spatial coverage, and suggested that peat typically initiated during the Holocene. We present 38 new basal dates, improving spatial coverage across the region. Some of the new basal dates are much older than any previous dates, indicating that peat initiated in the central Congo Basin at multiple locations in the Late Pleistocene. Our oldest basal date is 42 300 (41 200–43 800) calibrated years before present, making this one of the world’s oldest extant tropical peatlands, and twice as old as previously believed. The temporal distribution of basal dates suggests that changing climatic wetness has played a role in peat initiation in the region; numerous basal dates correspond with climatically wet phases, whilst few basal dates correspond with dry phases such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Today we find the central Congo Basin peatlands on wide interfluves between rivers, and on floodplains (mostly of the dendritic left-bank tributaries of the Congo River). We find the oldest basal dates on the floodplains of these left-bank tributaries, indicating a surprisingly high degree of channel stability over many millennia. This contrasts with, for example, peatlands on Amazonian floodplains, which are typically just a few thousand years old. The persistence of peat in the central Congo Basin since before the LGM, likely the most climatically dry period during the last 42 000 yr in this region, suggests that these areas may have played an important biogeographical role as forest refugia during glacial-interglacial cycles.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Understanding thermal stress in tropical forests has taken on new urgency in light of accelerating climate change and expansion of deforestation and forest degradation. Degraded tropical forests in particular may be approaching critical temperature thresholds even more rapidly than intact forests, with implications for tree survival and ecosystem recovery. We investigate thermal stress in degraded tropical forests within the Brazilian Amazon Arc of Deforestation. Using land surface temperature data from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on the international Space Station (ECOSTRESS), we compared canopy temperatures of intact, selectively logged, and burned forests in Feliz Natal, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Upper canopy temperatures in previously burned forests were 4.1% higher (mean = 36.5 °C) and 50.9% more variable compared to intact and logged forests, which showed remarkably similar temperature distributions (means of 34.9 °C and 35.1 °C, respectively). Modeled leaf temperature distributions based on canopy temperature measurements from one of the warmest days in a 2 year dry season record indicated that 87% of leaves in the warmest burned forest patches exceeded the temperature threshold where respiration surpasses photosynthesis, compared to approximately 72%–74% in intact and logged forests, respectively, in the same time period. After controlling for environmental factors, burned forests were predicted to be 2.6 °C warmer on average [1.39 °C–3.96 °C, 95% credible interval] than intact forests across a 5–40 m canopy height range. Burned forests showed modest thermal recovery over time, with temperatures decreasing by approximately 1.2 °C over a 30 year recovery period. In contrast, logged forests showed minimal thermal differences from intact forests (−0.353 on average, [−1.125–0.274, 95% credible interval]) and negligible change (0.15 °C) over the same timeframe. While the absolute probabilities of exceeding damaging thermal thresholds remain low across all forest types under current climate conditions, the probability of leaves exceeding temperatures that cause permanent leaf damage was ten times higher in burned forests, with implications for the future of burned forest regeneration in water-limited regions of the Amazon basin. In particular, the combination of higher mean temperatures, greater temperature variability, and more frequent exposure to damaging thermal thresholds implies that burned tropical forests will experience substantially higher mortality rates and slower biomass recovery compared to intact and selectively logged forests, especially in water-limited regions where trees cannot rely on evaporative cooling to moderate canopy temperatures.",

      "description": "Vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau (LP) of China is driven by atmospheric environmental changes (climate change, rising CO2, and nitrogen deposition), land cover change (LCC) from ecological restoration projects (ERPs), and change in forest age. However, the dominant factors influencing vegetation restoration remain controversial. This study improved the Deep Crossing network by integrating bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with embedding, creating the Deep Crossing LSTM Age (DC-LSTM-Age) network. It incorporates land cover type, forest age, and atmospheric environmental factors to reconstruct the leaf area index (LAI). We investigated the LAI increase (greening) driven by various factors and their dynamics in the Grain for Green Project (GGP) regions of the LP from 2001 to 2021. Results showed that DC-LSTM-Age network effectively simulated LAI values and its temporal dynamics in LCC regions, with superior validation performance (R2 = 0.87) compared to the Deep Crossing LSTM network (R2 = 0.84) that excluded forest age and the Bi-LSTM network (R2 = 0.79) that excluded forest age and land cover type. The greening trend in afforested regions (GGP-Forest, 0.013 m2 m−2yr−1) was much larger than in grass revegetation regions (GGP-Grass, 0.005 m2 m−2yr−1). Dominant drivers varied by restoration strategy: in GGP-Forest, LCC was the primary driver (0.25 m2 m−2, 52.9%), with an increasing impact over time. In GGP-Grass, atmospheric environmental changes dominated (0.127 m2 m−2, 78.5%), led by climate change (0.064 m2 m−2, 39.4%), CO2 rising (0.056 m2 m−2, 35%), and nitrogen deposition change (0.007 m2 m−2, 4.1%). The CO2 fertilization effect showed signs of saturation. This research highlights the crucial role of ERPs in LAI increase.",

      "description": "The widespread tea plantations in China provide significant economic value and sequester atmospheric CO2. However, the removal contribution of carbon sequestration to carbon emissions (CEs) in tea plantations remains unclear. Using the data of tea plantation areas and tea production of 16 provinces during 1978–2020, this study quantified the amount of carbon sequestration by vegetation and soil, and CE from fertilization, pesticide, diesel, energy and soil in tea plantations in China, and compared their removal contributions. The results showed that the continuous changes of carbon sequestration and CE in tea plantation, the amount of carbon sequestration in tea plantation increased from 1.73 –18.83 Tg C·yr−1 from 1978 to 2020, with the average carbon sequestration capacity of 6.63 Mg C·ha−1. The annual CE increased continuously from 3.52–10.54 Tg C·yr−1, with an average CE of 5.10 Mg C·ha−1. Therefore, the annual residual quantities after carbon removal increased from −1.99–8.29 Tg C·yr−1 between 1978 and 2020, and the annual residual proportions increased from −115.12% in 1978 to 44.03% in 2020. The carbon removal contribution of tea plantations in China was drastically promoted and varied significantly among the 16 provinces, the ecological management practices of tea plantations in Shandong and Guizhou provinces should be improved to promote their carbon removal contributions.",

      "description": "Conservation offers evidence-based insights into the state of ecosystems and biodiversity, while activism amplifies conservation goals through public and political engagement. Despite the importance of this relationship, a troubling pattern has emerged: environmental activism is increasingly met with disproportionate criminalization and punitive responses by many governments worldwide. Such repression not only threatens individual activists but also undermines the broader conservation movement by discouraging public participation and stifling dissent, ultimately jeopardizing our collective ability to address the planet’s most pressing challenges. This short perspective examines the growing trend of targeting environmental activists and discusses the potential consequences this may have for conservationists and anyone else concerned about the profound, immediate threats of climate change and environmental exploitation.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Accurate estimation of non-seasonal signals (NSSs) of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment monthly gravity field models is essential for identifying and understanding extreme hydrological phenomena. However, significant north-south striped noise in the models necessitates spectral filtering before estimating NSSs, resulting in signal attenuation and leakage. In this paper, we propose a one-step approach (OSA) that iteratively filters noise and estimates NSSs alongside trends and seasonal signals starting from unfiltered regional TWSA signals, where the covariance matrices of NSSs are populated using distance-based exponential functions. The non-seasonal TWSA signals in Southeastern China, estimated by OSA from April 2002 to December 2024, effectively preserves signal integrity with reduced spatial leakage and enhanced signal strength, aligning closely with those of the RL06 mascon products from CSR (Center for Space Research) and JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), achieving Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.91 and 0.90. Moreover, we introduce a Standardized NSS (SNSS) index from OSA, which enhances the consistency with the standardized streamflow index, identifying the extreme wetness in pearl river basin (PRB) and Southeastern River Basin (SERB) from August 2015 to June 2016, and the extreme drought in Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB) from July 2022 to April 2023. SNSS also exhibits enhanced correlations with nine key climate indices, especially for ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) and TIOS (Tropical Indian Ocean Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly), with cross-correlations of 0.99 and 0.96 for PRB, 0.97 and 0.94 for SERB during extreme wetness, and 0.96 and 0.90 for MLYRB during extreme drought.",

      "description": "Fire is the largest source of global vegetation disturbance and livestock farming is amongst humanity’s most pervasive impacts on the biosphere. However, no quantification has been made of livestock farming’s global impact on fire regimes. Here, we quantify the impact of livestock farming on global burned area (BA), through a combination of a new parameterisation of grassland grazing intensity in the Wildfire Human Agency Model and generalised linear models of fire’s many additional biophysical dimensions. Results demonstrate that livestock farming has contributed to the decline in global BA, but perhaps more importantly, also has highly spatially heterogenous impacts. Specifically, results suggest that the contrasting distributions of livestock grazing intensity and pastoral burning likely contribute to the observed BA anomaly in the savanna grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results serve to highlight the major potential role of ‘prescribed grazing’ as a climate change adaptation measure and, more broadly, reiterate the importance of interactions between human and biophysical processes in driving the distribution of fire on Earth.",
