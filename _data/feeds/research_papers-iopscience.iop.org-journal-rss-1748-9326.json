      "description": "Rising temperatures have increased the frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme temperature events over China in recent decades. The upward trends in heat extremes in China in the warm season (May–September) and their relationships with changes in aerosols and greenhouse gases are investigated using observations, reanalysis data and model results. Significant increasing trends in China are observed in daily maximum temperatures (TXx), heatwave frequency, and heatwave mean duration during 2011–2023, with increasing rates of 0.70 °C/decade, 3.77 d/decade and 0.31 d/event/decade, respectively. This study shows that 43 ± 3% of the TXx increases in China are attributed to the rising CO2 concentrations. Aerosol optical depth in China decreased at a rate of 0.054 per decade from 2011 to 2023 due to significant air quality improvements. The weakened aerosol cooling effect due to declining aerosols contributes 27 ± 3% to the observed TXx trend. In eastern China, where aerosol reductions were most significant, aerosol reduction even accounts for 79 ± 10% of the TXx increasing trend. The intensifying heat waves attributed to GHGs and aerosols are in accordance with the increasing extreme high temperatures. The results highlight the significant impacts of rising GHGs and decreasing aerosols on heat extreme events over China in recent years, emphasizing the need of considering both GHGs and aerosols to address the issue of intensification of heat extremes in a warming future.",

      "description": "Forest restoration has gained global momentum, with proclaimed positive effects anticipated to impact socio-ecological systems worldwide. Despite the potential positive outcomes achieved through forest restoration (hereafter restoration), many projects have neglected to focus on social and biocultural benefits of restoration at the local level. Erasures of locally-derived restoration priorities by larger-scale actors (e.g. project developers, practitioners, funders, and scholars) have resulted in inequitable distributions of benefits and tree mortality. It is therefore crucial to determine some of the key locally-derived, plural priorities and benefits of restoration. In this study, we investigated how communities conceptualize the priorities and benefits of restoration by conducting in-depth participatory mapping workshops with two Indigenous communities, two Afro-descendant (Quilombola) communities, and two agrarian-reform settlements in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil–a top global priority biome for restoration. Through transdisciplinary mapmaking exercises on conceptions of restoration, we assembled five primary themes on the plural ways that communities have reappropriated the concept of restoration and created alternatives to how restoration has been commonly represented by larger-scale actors. These include: asserting territorial sovereignty and defending claims to lands; Bem Viver (living well); contesting dominant narratives about monoculture, capitalism, and land speculation; caring for ancestors, animals, and other living things, and fulfilling spiritual and cultural responsibilities; and realizing dreams and visions for desired futures. By broadening conceptualizations of the priorities and benefits of restoration, our study diverges from past research on restoration and emphasizes the importance of expanding beyond narrow definitions of restoration. We highlight the critical role of communities in the restoration process and the importance of conducting direct work with affected communities to inform the way restoration is understood, discussed, and practiced. This research may support action towards a restoration future that is both effective and equitable.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Temperature of leaves and canopies is critically important for many physiological processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration. But the variation of canopy temperature and its relationship with air temperature across a range of ecosystems and environmental conditions is understudied, challenging our ability to predict canopy temperature responses in a rapidly warming climate. Therefore, to better understand how environmental drivers and site characteristics interact with vegetation types to influence these temperature dynamics, we analyzed canopy temperature estimates derived from upwelling longwave radiation measurements across seven years and 36 NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) sites in the USA. Canopy temperature consistently exceeded or closely tracked air temperature, with the strength and magnitude of this relationship varying by vegetation type. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed incoming shortwave radiation as the dominant driver of ΔT (canopy temperature—air temperature). While this driver was consistently important across all sites, sites within the same vegetation type tended to respond similarly to the full set of environmental drivers. Vegetation height was associated with variation in the magnitude of ΔT. These findings support the use of vegetation type groupings to capture generalizable patterns in canopy temperature dynamics, patterns that are critical for understanding ecosystem responses under future climate scenarios.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is critical for achieving net-zero and net-negative CO2 emissions that can halt and potentially reverse global warming, respectively. However, reliable CDR is still costly and comes with considerable technological and ecological uncertainties. Despite the centrality of equity in the Paris Agreement, no integrated framework exists to equitably allocate responsibilities for CDR and residual emissions among countries. Here, we present a justice-based framework that separates out ethical considerations for equitably allocating gross emissions and gross CDR, addressing how these contributions shift before and after reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions. The framework distinguishes between CDR delivered as a common good to reach a collective global climate outcome, and CDR that is used to pay off carbon debts due to emissions overconsumption. We offer a new perspective for how nations with substantial historical responsibilities and emerging economies with increasing capacities can collaborate and equitably share the CDR burden, enhancing both international cooperation and national-level climate action.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy sources is vital for carbon neutrality and sustainable development. This study evaluates the integration of photovoltaic (PV) technology into China’s extensive railway network and reveals that suitable areas on rails could potentially generate 204.6 TWh of electricity annually, equivalent to more than twice of the Three Gorges Power Station’s output, and accounting for approximately 9.2% of China’s total renewable electricity generation in 2020 (2,214.8 TWh). The proposed hybrid railway PV energy system is estimated at a national average levelized cost of electricity of 0.14 CNY kWh−1, with a potential profit of CNY 77.8 billion upon transitioning from the current electricity supply. Among 371 cities analyzed, 291 (78.4%) are expected to reach a production-side grid parity, while all cities would achieve user-side grid parity. The implementation of this PV system could significantly mitigate environmental impacts, reducing carbon emissions by 126.5 Mt and lowering air pollutants, including 64 199 tons of NOX, 44 423 tons of SO2, and 7789 tons of PMX. Substantial railways in rural regions can optimize the energy consumption structure of rural residents, reducing the share of coal and liquefied petroleum gas in per capita energy consumption from 29.44% to 7.27%, and leading their average annual expenditure on primary energy sources dropping from CNY667.9 to CNY502.7—a 24.23% reduction.",

      "title": "Responding to rising waters and temperatures: greenhouse gas flux from a high-latitude coastal wetland",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adff98",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate change is exposing coastal landscapes to more flooding, in addition to rapidly rising temperatures. These changes are critical in the Arctic where the effects of sea level rise are exacerbated by the loss of sea ice protecting coasts, subsidence as permafrost thaws, and a projected increase in storms. Such changes will likely alter the land-atmosphere gas exchange of high-latitude coastal ecosystems, but the effects of flooding with warming remain unexplored. In this work we use a field experiment to examine the interacting effects of increased tidal flooding and warming on land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange in the coastal Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, a large sub-Arctic wetland and tundra complex in western Alaska. We inundated dammed plots to simulate two levels of future flooding: low-intensity flooding represented by one day of flooding per summer-month (June, July and August), and high-intensity flooding represented by three-consecutive days of flooding per summer-month, crossed with a warming treatment of 1.4 °C. We found that both flooding and warming influenced greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. Low-intensity flooding reduced net CO2 uptake by 20% (0.78 μmol m−2 s−1) regardless of temperature, and marginally increased CH4 emissions 0.83 nmol m−2 s−1 (33%) under ambient temperature, while decreasing CH4 emissions by −1.96 nmol m−2 s−1 (40%) under warming. In contrast, high-intensity flooding restored net CO2 uptake to control levels due to enhanced primary productivity under both temperature treatments. High-intensity flooding decreased CH4 emissions under ambient temperature by 0.76 nmol m−2 s−1 (30%), but greatly increased emissions under warming by 4.68 nmol m−2 s−1 (265%), presumably driven by increased plant-mediated CH4 transport. These findings reveal that GHG exchange responds rapidly and non-linearly to intensifying flooding, and highlight the importance of short-term flooding dynamics and warming in shaping future carbon cycling in this Arctic coastal wetland.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae0052",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption–average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Short-term prediction of sea level anomaly (SLA) and ocean surface currents over a domain are usually carried out using ocean general circulation models. In this study, we present a univariate machine learning framework using long short term memory networks that forecasts daily-averaged SLA with a 3 d lead time over the north Indian Ocean using historical satellite altimetry data at a spatial resolution of ∼13 km. Assuming that SLA reanalysis from state-of-the-art systems represent the pinnacle of performance skill of forecasts from dynamical models, we show that the SLA forecasts from our model exhibits superior skills through comprehensive analyses. The errors are typically less than 0.04 m over most of the domain and the correlations are close to unity. The skills of the daily-averaged forecasted currents with a 3 d lead, estimated using geostrophic and Ekman theory, are comparable with the best available reanalysis when compared to in-situ observations both in the open ocean or shelf. Treating these forecasted surface currents as synthetic observations, we show that assimilating them can significantly improve the instantaneous subsurface currents during forecasts. The subsurface correlations turn significant with 99% confidence level across depth which were otherwise mostly insignificant and the errors reduce by 0.1 m·s−1. We demonstrate that the short-term forecast of daily-averaged SLA and surface currents can be approached as a collection of localized low-dimensional independent univariate systems thereby reducing computational costs by large margins. This machine learning framework heralds a paradigm shift in the realm of ocean forecasting.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Tailoring policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, cognizant of rapid population aging and shrinkage, is crucial for many developed nations. South Korea faces this issue, particularly owing to a rise in the nation’s average age at an unprecedented rate and a significantly low total fertility rate (TFR) (0.72 in 2023). Research on measures to reduce GHG emissions in an aging society with a declining birthrate has highlighted the importance of the structure of household carbon footprint (HCF) across different age groups. However, no studies have analyzed the structure of HCF across different age groups or the impact of demographic changes on HCF in South Korea. This study highlights the structures of HCF by age group in South Korea by combining a multi-regional input–output model with household and demographic surveys. Furthermore, we projected the effects of demographic changes in line with business-as-usual and an ambitious government policy for recovering the TFR (BaU and fertility rate recovery (FRR) Scenarios, respectively) on HCF from 2020 to 2050. These procedures revealed that the FRR will increase in 13.5 Mt-CO2eq in 2050, compared to BaU. This brings the HCF of senior generations (60 years and older) from 49.7% (BaU) to 48.3% (FRR) of the total HCF in 2050, slightly reducing their dominance of HCF. With the fertility recovery policy, the impact of an increase in the HCF of younger generations, aged 39 years and below, was limited until 2050. However, the rebound of HCF (e.g. education, entertainment and culture, restaurants, and hotels) must be considered in case the number of younger generations continues to increase, underlying national policies for fertility recovery.",

      "description": "Gridded precipitation datasets are widely used to monitor hydroclimatic trends, yet their accuracy in tropical South America remains uncertain. Here, we systematically compare trends from state-of-the-art precipitation datasets with station data across the region. Our results reveal substantial disagreements in both the magnitude and direction of trends, with datasets frequently failing to capture observed station trends. Trend accuracy varies considerably, with better agreement in more densely sampled areas like the Caatinga, while the Western and Northern Amazonia show lower accuracy. Moreover, we find limited agreement between datasets and stations regarding documented patterns, such as southern Amazonia drying during the dry season and Western Amazonia wetting in the wet season. An exception is the Southeastern Cerrado, where most datasets consistently capture significant drying trends in the wet season. Our findings highlight the need for a multi-dataset approach and an improved observational network to assess precipitation changes in tropical South America.",
