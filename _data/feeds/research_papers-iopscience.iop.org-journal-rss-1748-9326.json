      "description": "Current anthropogenic climate change is increasing the occurrence and magnitude of heatwaves causing closely interconnected and interdependent risks across multiple domains, such as environmental and human health, water and food security, etc. The following systematic literature review synthesizes the state of the art concerning risks related to heatwaves by analyzing 1459 publications. Since risks arise from the interaction of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, publications were first classified by risk components and then further categorized by research fields: healthcare, society, ecosystem, agriculture, infrastructure, and heritage. The analysis allowed the identification of gaps in the current research with implications for policies and practical applications of risk assessments. First, only 3.1% of the revised literature integrates all three components in risk assessments. Second, most of the literature provides average risks over several heatwave events, thus neglecting critical factors like heatwave magnitude and duration. Third, the absence of standardized indices for identifying and classifying heatwaves hinders effective comparisons of results within the same field. It is recommended that future studies in the same field adopt a common methodology and that the above gaps are taken into account as this would enable building more robust and coherent scientific evidence while reducing ambiguities and uncertainties in risk estimates. Decisionmakers may otherwise struggle to develop effective heatwave adaptation and mitigation strategies if risk assessments are inconsistent or unreliable, and fail to account for risk interdependencies across different domains. More research is needed to develop quantitative frameworks that estimate heatwave risks by summing contributions from each affected domain. This is particularly important, as most of the papers reviewed only focused on healthcare (61.1%) or ecosystems (16.3%). However, we acknowledge that this literature review may have excluded some relevant studies, such as those in the heritage field, due to the specific search string applied in our methodology.",

      "description": "Inland flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging natural disasters in the United States. Recent studies in the literature suggest that climate change will likely lead to an increase in the severity and frequency of inland flooding events in the U.S. We review the diverse literature on inland flooding to synthesize the current state of knowledge and to identify knowledge gaps. The topics covered include flood risk perception, insurance uptake, impact on property values, public mitigation strategies, behavioral responses to flooding, fatalities, and damages. We identify important gaps in the literature related to flood insurance demand, adoption of policies that encourage private and public investment in flood management, and flood risk management impacts in disadvantaged communities. Future research should identify factors that have decreased flood-related fatalities over time. Disentangling how infrastructure investments and better flood information improve outcomes during and after a flood could generate more effective tools and policies for mitigating damage from inland floods. Finally, creating and publishing comprehensive datasets that integrate economic, flood, and policy variables over space and time would facilitate future research on the economics of inland flooding. Our findings point to specific future research opportunities that would improve available databases, inform flood risk management strategies, and ultimately reduce the costs of inland floods.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/add60d",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Tropical cyclone (TC) hazards coupled with dense urban development along the coastline have resulted in trillions in US damages over the past several decades, with an increasing trend in losses in recent years. So far, this trend has been driven by increasing coastal development. However, as the climate continues to warm, changing TC climatology may also cause large changes in coastal damages in the future. Approaches to quantifying regional TC risk typically focus on total storm damage. However, it is crucial to understand the spatial footprint of TC damage and ultimately the spatial distribution of TC risk. Here, we quantify the magnitude and spatial pattern of TC risk (in expected annual damage (EAD)) across the US from wind, storm surge, and rainfall using synthetic TCs, physics-based hazard models, and a county-level statistical damage model trained on historical TC data. We then combine end-of-century TC hazard simulations with US population growth and wealth increase scenarios (under the SSP2 4.5 emission scenario) to investigate the sensitivity of changes in TC risk across the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts. We find that not directly accounting for the effects of rainfall and storm surge results in much lower risk estimates and smaller future increases in risk. TC climatology change and socioeconomic change drive similar magnitude increases in total EAD across the US (roughly 160%), and that their combined effect (633% increase) is much higher.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate change is increasing sulfate export and changing wetland extent in mountain regions. These changes may increase microbially mediated production of the neurotoxic substance methylmercury due to enhanced sulfate metabolism in mountain environments. Here, we assess methylmercury concentrations and formation rates across high-elevation wetlands in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We also investigate sulfate controls on methylmercury production within subalpine peatlands by amending soils with sulfate to mimic increased stream export of sulfate from the alpine zone and measuring methylmercury formation rates for different sulfate treatments. We found that subalpine peatlands have statistically significant higher methylmercury concentrations and formation rates compared to alpine, mineral-soil wetlands. Methylmercury production in subalpine peatlands also increased significantly (p < 0.05) following sulfate additions; the highest rates occurred in sediments with intermediate extractable sulfate concentrations (∼0.60–1.4 mg sulfate g−1 dry soil). Our study is the first to identify soil sulfate-related thresholds for methylmercury production and sulfate-limitation of methylmercury production in subalpine peatlands. These findings highlight important linkages between climate-driven mineral weathering and mercury cycling in mountain regions globally.",

      "description": "In July 2022, a national emergency was declared in the United Kingdom (UK) following the Met Office’s first-ever red extreme heat warning. As temperatures reached 40.3 °C, thousands of excess deaths were recorded. Based on 38 expert interviews and 4 focus groups with key decision-makers and stakeholders working on the frontline of the 2022 UK heatwaves, we found that the country is not prepared for extreme heat because: (1) policies and planning prioritise coping over resilience; (2) insufficient preventative actions were taken; and (3) a range of barriers hinder effective short and longer-term measures. We argue that whilst the UK coped with the heatwaves in 2022, it lacks the resilience needed to deal with persistent and prolonged heat events.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "In water-limited ecosystems, evidence suggests that photovoltaic (PV) arrays may alleviate water stress, potentially mitigating the loss of key ecosystem services such as forage production. This hypothesized aridity mitigation potential (AMP) of PV arrays posits that negative effects of reduced sunlight on photosynthesis and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) are offset by improved water relations, maintaining or enhancing productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Field tests of this hypothesis are lacking, however. Here we test the AMP hypothesis in a semi-arid Colorado (USA) grassland by contrasting ANPP responses to a single-axis tracking PV array in years with above- and below average precipitation. At all sites within and outside the PV array, precipitation inputs strongly limited ANPP. But in dry years, ANPP was increased by ∼20% in the array relative to adjacent open grassland, with ANPP in some array locations (near PV panel edges) increased by ∼90%. This AMP effect was muted with average precipitation and disappeared in wet years. We conclude that with climate change projections of increased aridity and drought, PV arrays that reduce plant water stress could provide a unique opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate some of their ecosystem consequences in water-limited grasslands.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Understanding climate change’s possible effects on sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is vital for marine ecosystems. For the first time, the potential effects of climate change on SSTs were investigated using the SST data from five meteorological observation stations located along the Black Sea coast of Türkiye, covering the period 1963–2014. The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenario outputs of the general circulation models, namely CNRM-ESM2-1, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, and NORESM2-MM, selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 archive were downscaled to station scale by conventional regression analysis and artificial neural networks as statistical downscaling method in the study. SST values for the future periods (2023–2052 and 2053–2082) were obtained using the ensemble model approach for each station. Additionally, quantile delta mapping was used for bias correction. Three performance metrics were used to evaluate the downscaling performance of the methods. The model with the best performance was selected, and the future SST results were obtained and compared with the historical observation data. It was projected that monthly SSTs may increase by 1.66 °C–4.25 °C under the SSP2-4.5 scenario and 1.71 °C–5.75 °C under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. This increases may cause the deterioration of the marine ecosystem and local economic downturn in the Southwestern Black Sea.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Uneven economic impacts of climate change have been largely caused by differentiated warming rates across different geographical regions, affecting the lives of the majority of world’s population. Historical and future warming rates are commonly obtained from global climate models, which exhibit considerable spread in terms of global mean and region-dependent warming rates. While the multi-model spread in global mean warming rate has been widely reported in past literature, the multi-model spread in terms of the global warming pattern and its temporal evolution remain unclear. Here, we show that the multi-model spread in the simulated global warming pattern depends closely on the level of warming. The simulated global warming pattern deviates substantially among CMIP6 models before the 2010s and converges afterwards, as the levels of global greenhouse gases and mean warming elevates. Moreover, the consistency of model-predicted future warming patterns varies by emission scenario. Models predict increasingly consistent warming patterns under intermediate and high emission scenarios during the entire 21st century; whereas under low emission scenarios, the multi-models consistency in their simulated future warming patterns reaches a hiatus around the middle of the 21st century. While our study detects a synchronism between the multi-model consistency in the global warming pattern and the global warming level, the physical mechanisms underlying such varying multi-model consistency in the warming pattern merits further investigation.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The decarbonization of the fossil fuel-intensive power sector is critical for climate mitigation. During the global financial crisis, we found that major countries changed their energy inputs and achieved a rapid low-carbon transition in the global power sector. In this study, we employ two-stage decomposition models to reveal the diverse drivers of the peak-and-decline dynamics in the global CO2 intensity of electricity. We then examine the regional heterogeneous drivers of CO2 intensity from major electricity-producing countries within three income groups. Results show that the global CO2 intensity of electricity reached its peak in 2007 and has declined by 0.35% per year since then. High-income countries consistently reduce the CO2 intensity, while upper- and lower-middle income countries contributed to a reduction of the CO2 intensity until recently. The adoption of renewable energy, the phase-out of thermal power, and improvements in energy efficiency supported by pronounced regional allocation effects contribute to the rapid decline in the global CO2 intensity of electricity. This paper reveals breakthroughs in the recent global energy transition and sheds light on future CO2 mitigation pathways in the global power sector.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adda62",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The last decade has seen a large number of severe heatwaves that were unprecedented in the observational record, highlighting challenges associated with observationally-based statistical quantification of the likelihood and magnitude of future extreme temperatures. An alternative to such probabilistic assessments is identification of upper bounds that quantify the hottest surface air temperatures that can possibly be achieved by the end of the 21st century. Theory, simulations, and observational analyses support the existence of a finite upper bound for surface air temperature; however, estimates for future upper-bound values that are realistic and usable for planning remain unavailable. Here, we combine atmospheric theory with large ensembles of dynamically downscaled projections to estimate historical and end-of-century upper bounds for surface air temperatures. A number of physical mechanisms can influence upper bounds, and at the end of the 21st century, estimates based on mechanisms that yield more moderate upper-bounds produce values around C for much of the Western United States and in excess of C for the hottest parts of the domain. Even cooler high-altitude locations have end-of-century upper bounds over C. Although these upper-bound estimates might seem implausibly large, increases in the upper bounds over the 21st century are similar to increases in dynamically downscaled peak surface temperatures after adjusting those downscaled temperatures to eliminate the possibly biased model trends in surface specific humidity. While upper bound estimates are high relative to historical observations, they nonetheless suggest that heatwave intensity risk is bounded, with uncertainty dominated by projections of surface and upper-level humidity.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is recognized as an essential ecological safeguard in China, significantly contributing to ecological stability and environmental protection. However, rapid socioeconomic development poses significant threats to the ecological security of the region. To address this issue, this study used normalized difference vegetation index data to identify ecological source areas. Using optimal parameters-based geographical detector model processed a multi-source data set to develop an ecological spatial network. Methods for topological and pattern analysis were utilized to examine the network. Additionally, various ecosystem services (ESs) within the ecological source areas and their interrelationships were calculated to analyze their associations with network characteristics, climate, and human factors under different network patterns. Finally, based on the importance of the structure and function of regional vegetation, a series of strategies has been proposed to optimize and protect the stability of its spatial distribution. The research findings show that: (1) areas with high ES indicator values are mainly found in the upper reaches of the YRB and the adjacent regions of the Taihang Mountains (2) the ecological spatial network of the YRB is denser in the mid-upper reaches and sparser in the lower reaches. (3) There is a significant synergy between water supply and water conservation within the ecological source areas, while landscape aesthetics and carbon storage, as well as water supply and carbon storage, exhibit significant trade-off effects. (4) Five network patterns and six ES bundles were identified. The correlation between ESs, network topological metrics, and climate-human factors varies across different patterns, with more structurally complete network patterns generally providing better ESs.",
