      "description": "Tree stems represent a long-lived biomass compartment for atmospheric carbon sequestration. While terrestrial biosphere models predict rising carbon sequestration in forests, direct observations of tree growth are inconclusive due to varying standardization procedures of tree-ring series and complex factors influencing stem growth such as moisture and nutrient deficits and anthropogenic carbon and nitrogen fertilization. The mismatch between tree-ring-based observations, repeated inventories at permanent plots, and predictions of biospheric models represents a significant knowledge gap limiting forecasting of future forest growth. Using the novel approach free of tree-ring standardization trials and focusing on even-aged trees sampled from uneven-aged forest stands, we present a robust comparison of tree stem diameter changes in temperate forests between 1990 and 2015 along environmental gradients in Central Europe. The stem sizes of four out of five species showed significant enlargement while also partly increasing stem growth limitation due to moisture availability. The largest increase in stem diameter was recorded for late succession species on fertile sites. By contrast, the stem size of early-succession species on dry and nutrient-poor sites remained unaltered. Stems of mature trees in present-day forests are, on average, 8% thicker than their counterparts in 1990 consistent with trends predicted by terrestrial biosphere models. We demonstrated that, despite increasing drought limitation, temperate tree species enlarged their stems. Viewed in conjunction with older permanent plot data, Central-European temperate forests exhibited almost half century of continuous stem enlargement, potentially impacting forest functioning in terms of size-sensitive characteristics such as susceptibility to drought and disturbances.",

      "description": "The stability of food supply and prices may depend more on annual changes in yields from year-to-year variability in weather than on longer-term average changes from changing climatic conditions. However, the absence of high-quality data on crop yields at fine spatial resolutions in many regions of the world makes it challenging to statistically model their response to interannual variability in weather patterns. Therefore, there is a need for empirical methods that can project annual crop yield changes even in limited data regions. Here, we propose a transfer learning algorithm that uses high spatial resolution data from one region to project yields in another region with more limited data. The goal of our work is to understand what data types can be beneficial for transferring learning from a source region to a very different target region with more limited data. We utilize Long Short-Term Memory to develop a transfer learning model that is trained on historical county-level corn yield in the United States and predicts district-level corn yield variations in India. Even using smaller amounts of data in India, simulating a data-scarce region, we achieve an average root mean square error of 0.48 bu acre−1 in predicting interannual yield variations. Using Shapley values to interpret results, we explore the contribution of the different weather parameters to interannual yield variability and find a larger influence of precipitation-related variables. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of this method for transferring models of weather impacts on crop yields trained on a data-rich country to one with more limited data. It suggests the potential of applying the transfer learning model to mitigate the need for extensive raw data globally.",

      "description": "Synthesizing the multidimensional characteristics of landscape ecosystems provides critical insights for ecological risk assessment and complex human–nature interdependencies. Through the synergetic integration of multi-temporal datasets encompassing landscape ecological risk (LER), ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecosystem stability sustainability (ESS), we formulate a novel three-dimensional analytical framework based on ‘pattern-service-stability’. This methodological advancement enables the quantification of dynamic ecosystem risk in the Poyang Lake Plain from 2000 to 2035 through multi-scenario simulation. The results reveal that (1) changes in forest, water and impervious land exhibit significant scenario dependence. The ecological protection (EP) scenario preserved higher forest–water proportions, while the urban growth (UG) scenario exhibited accelerated construction expansion, with the natural development scenario maintaining transitional states. (2) LER remains consistently low across periods, characterised by stability and minimal inter-scenario variations. The ESV shows a decreasing trend, with high ESV areas decreasing abruptly and becoming concentrated in Poyang Lake’s southern bay. The low ESV increases significantly in the UG scenario, while the EP scenario maintains a higher service capacity. The ESS displays pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Extreme values of ESS tend to be flat, while high-grade ESS dominates under the EP scenario. (3) The interaction among LER, ESV and ESS has significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity and policy sensitivity. The lakeshore is mostly characterised by ‘low LER-high ESS’, while near-lake zone is concentrated in ‘high LER-low ESS’, with the ESV in each zone mostly in an intermediate state. (4) The growth rate and spatial variation of the ecosystem risk index (ERI) were small during 2000–2023, but ERI was predicted to surge under the UG scenario. (5) The ecosystem risk evolution paths are different in each zone and roughly conform to a linear fit, with the lakeshore exhibiting accelerated risk escalation. The gravity centre of each risk early warning unit is located in Nanchang County. This spatially explicit diagnostic framework enables dynamic ecosystem risk early warning management and resilience enhancement.",

      "description": "The first and current global stocktake launched by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change unveils lags and regional differences in climate resilience (CR) efforts and stresses the need to improve the effective adoption of ecosystem-based climate adaptation systems. The current study provides a critical analysis of literature on the application of green infrastructure (GI) and ecosystem-based technologies for CR. The review revealed regional disparities in implementation, technological applications, and scales of integration. Analysis conducted indicated that the United States, the United Kingdom and China are key pioneers in implementation; while developing nations, tropical and Mediterranean regions need more research and execution. Emergent findings showed that research on GI-CR achieved exponential growth in 2016, after the Paris Agreement. Further, built environment-scale CR considerations have accomplished significant developments. At the built environment-scale, the review systematically developed a five-stage implementation framework for GI-CR from grey infrastructure to broader systems, such as nature-based solutions and green cities. At the building-scale, the review revealed a weak linkage between CR and sustainability studies. The analysis therefore delineates the need to consider integrated CR systems that effectively incorporate mitigation and adaptation guidelines. Holistically, key directions provided include willingness to pay, the need for integrated sustainability and resilience systems, digital technologies application for indicator selection and effective monitoring. This study provides clear future research directions by highlighting existing knowledge gaps, scope considerations, geographic factors, and key areas for exploration within the realm of GI-CR.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Nitrogen (N) legacy effects are widely recognized as a primary obstacle to the improvements of water quality following mitigation efforts. The exploration of long-term nutrient trajectories for nitrogen model (ELEMeNT-N) has been applied to estimate legacy effects in several watersheds globally. However, ELEMeNT-N does not account for the accumulation-release processes of nitrate within soil profile, introducing potential uncertainty in long-term simulations. This study enhances ELEMeNT-N by incorporating a soil nitrate accumulation coefficient and a deep soil nitrate cycling module to better assess the long-term impact of legacy N on water quality. Long-term simulation for riverine N flux in the Yongan watershed, China (1980–2022) indicate that the modified model, ELEMeNT-N-SP, demonstrated significantly improved performance relative to the original model (Nash–Sutcliff coefficient: 0.89 vs 0.72, R2: 0.89 vs. 0.71). ELEMeNT-N-SP results indicate that ∼39.5% of N input accumulated in soil and groundwater, mainly in agricultural soil-groundwater. Legacy N contributed to 81.7% (Temporal: 65.6%–92.0%; i.e. cumulative contributions of historical N inputs) of riverine N flux (466 kg N ha−1). Among 12 modeling units, legacy N accumulation (SON: 175–1083 kg N ha−1; soil nitrate: −11–259 kg N ha−1; groundwater: 147–656 kg N ha−1) and its contribution to riverine N flux (Spatial: 64.0%–85.5%) showed considerable spatial heterogeneity. Agricultural soil-groundwater served as the primary accumulation sink for N input and the important source of riverine N pollution. Model validation, which included comparisons with monitored soil-groundwater N content and dual stable isotope data, confirmed the reliability of ELEMeNT-N-SP. ELEMeNT-N-SP offers a valuable framework for improving watershed nutrient management globally, emphasizing the importance of incorporating soil N cycling dynamics into predictive tools.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "In light of climate change, urbanization and worldwide mobility trends, the requirements for transforming urban transport systems towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are twofold. First, understanding the systemic interactions underlying sustainable development as envisioned in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is key. In the context of urban transport systems, this includes understanding what hinders or fosters reduced carbon emissions. Second, systemic knowledge must be coupled with a strong societal and political engagement. This study analyses whether citizen assessments of key SDG interactions in urban transport systems play a role in predicting individual transport mode choices. Normatively, changes in individually held systemic perspectives could encourage greater use of low-carbon transport modes in urban and peri-urban areas, which would be an essential step toward climate change mitigation. We use survey data (n = 822) to measure citizens’ perspectives on the urban transport system and their transportation habits in terms of car driving, cycling, or public transport. We use a Bayesian multilevel regression model to investigate ‘How do citizen assessments of SDG interactions influence transport mode choices?’. We find that negative citizen assessments of the influence of car-related (1) infrastructure and (2) transport affordability on reduced carbon emissions are associated with reduced frequency of car-driving. Conversely, we find that positive citizen assessments of the influence of (3) road safety for cyclists and (4) public transport affordability on reduced carbon emissions are associated with increased frequency of cycling and public transport use, respectively.",

      "description": "The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to agricultural soils results in the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), accounting for ∼40% of Canada’s and 10% of global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing these emissions through N fertilizer best management practices (BMPs) is critical to achieve the fertilizer-related emission reduction target of 30% below 2020 levels by 2030 set by the Canadian government. However, progress is hindered by several key challenges: (1) the need to quantify N2O emission reductions associated with BMPs, (2) an incomplete understanding of the behavioral factors influencing the adoption of BMPs, (3) the lack of suitable metrics to track progress towards reduction targets, and (4) an absence of region-specific management recommendations that balance emission reduction potential with farm profitability and farmer decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce canN2Onet, an innovative collaborative network formed in 2024 and comprising a diverse range of experts from institutions across Canada with partners representing academia, industry, government, and producer organizations. canN2Onet is focused on (1) the establishment of a national network of benchmark sites linking year-round N2O emission measurements and soil processes with behavioral economic studies on decision-making processes; (2) development and validation of robust metrics for tracking progress towards emission reduction targets by utilizing Canada’s first regional tower measurements, database development, and enhanced biogeochemical models; and (3) creation of a roadmap for emission reduction by up-scaling BMPs to the regional level, incorporating economic trade-offs and behavioral insights. This work represents the first coordinated national effort to generate a comprehensive understanding of N2O mitigation potential from improved management practices across Canada’s major grain and oilseed-producing regions. It offers actionable farm-level metrics reflective of real-world agricultural conditions and a transferable framework to guide region-specific nutrient management strategies globally, advancing both climate goals and agricultural sustainability.",

In this study, we introduce the Global Drought Impact Report Database, a system for the weekly collection and classification of drought impact data from online media sources, designed to support near-real-time monitoring. The database includes over 9400 drought impact reports from 152 countries. The database is updated weekly, and the results are publicly available at a pilot database content viewer. The database can serve as a complementary source for drought monitoring, early impact detection, and global impact analysis, and may support further assessment of drought monitoring systems.",

      "description": "Marine cold-spells (MCSs), the cold ocean temperature extremes as the counterpart to marine heatwaves (MHWs), may have brutal impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. However, recent MCS-related researches mainly focused on the ocean surface, while the character of bottom MCSs (BMCSs) remains unclear. Here, we provide an analogous assessment of BMCSs and surface MCSs (SMCSs) over the continental shelf of China based on a 1/12° ocean reanalysis dataset during period of 1993–2023. We found that the duration and cumulative intensity of BMCSs can be longer and more intense than SMCSs, up to 20 d and ‒20 °C days, respectively. The mean and cumulative intensities of BMCSs and SMCSs increased in most regions, reaching 0.2 °C–0.4 °C/10a and 20 °C–40 °C days/10a, respectively. In contrast, there are no clear trends in the area-averaged time series of BMCS/SMCS metrics over the period 1993–2023. In terms of category and seasonal variations, BMCS generally has longer days than SMCS in the Moderate and Strong categories, persists longer than SMCS in summer and autumn (ranging from 2–6 d), and is more intense than SMCS in autumn and winter (ranging from 1 °C–2 °C). There are clear differences in category and seasonal changes between BMCS and SMCS. Furthermore, annual BMCS days are positively correlated with bottom depth, while mean intensity is negatively correlated. In addition, BMCS and SMCS often co-occur over shallow areas where the mixed layer depth can extend to the bottom.",

      "description": "Reliable projections of wildfire risk are important for multi-sector impacts analysis. Statistically downscaled and bias-corrected Earth system model ensemble products are routinely used to analyze regional physical wildfire risk, but evaluations of historical observed trends and variability are lacking. Here, we evaluate physical fire risk over the western United States using the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) by comparing model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), statistically downscaled via the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) approach, against the observational target dataset gridMET, a gridded high-resolution surface meteorological product. We analyze multidecadal trends and interannual variability in seasonal average FWI for the historical period and future projections under two emissions scenarios, and we compare MACA-CMIP5 ensemble results with a simple time series model that generates historical and future projections of seasonal FWI based on bootstrapping observed historical trends and variability. Our findings indicate that MACA-CMIP5 accurately captures the magnitude and spatial patterns of seasonally averaged FWI but tends to underestimate historical decadal trends. We show that future increases in fire risk may be underestimated relative to the simple time series model that projects historical variability into the future. We also highlight that model biases in relative humidity contribute significantly to model-data differences. Our results underscore the importance of historical hindcasting exercises for informing broader multi-sector applications.",

      "description": "Understanding the response of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a net-zero carbon emission scenario is critical for correctly projecting future climate variability after the Paris Agreement. This study examines the behavior of ENSO using the Community Earth System Model version 2, in which a 400 year simulation was performed, following the SSP5-8.5 pathway, then gradually reducing CO2 emissions to net-zero with stabilization period. After reaching net-zero CO2 emissions, the state of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) is characterized by two different pathways, either fast warming or slow warming. We found that both El Niño and La Niña events have intensified during the North Atlantic fast warming period compared to that during the North Atlantic slow warming period. This is due to the strengthening of the La Niña-like mean state in the tropical Pacific under the rapid warming of the North Atlantic, which enhances the Ekman pumping feedback and zonal advective feedback. Therefore, this study suggests that in a net-zero CO2 emission environment, ENSO amplitude can either increase or decrease, but it is regulated by the North Atlantic SST state, implying that the inter-basin interactions should be considered to understand ENSO variability even after reaching net-zero emissions.",

      "description": "Kazakhstan has set a lofty goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% before 2030 to combat climate change. Kazakhstan is a middle-income country with a highly centralized government, dependent on extractive industries for 21.3% of its GDP. Kazakhstan has positioned itself as a ‘strong state’ that promotes sustainable development in its pursuit of international investment. Utilizing a centralized approach to energy policy, Kazakhstan is seeking to become a center for the manufacturing of renewable energy equipment and a key player in the global energy transition. Yet, this seems to be at odds with their goals of creating a sustainable environmental future in local communities. To better understand the energy transition policies pursued, this article examines the energy sector through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Drawing on expert stakeholder interviews, this study examines the SWOT to Kazakhstan’s energy transition from the perspective of stakeholder groups. Based on the findings from the interviews, this article suggests policies that Kazakhstan can adopt from other emerging economies to balance socio-economic needs with sustainability goals to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality target. The findings provide practical insights for policymakers, local government officials, and development practitioners seeking to align national energy goals with the needs of local stakeholders. Additionally, the study contributes to academic debates on decentralized governance and energy transition by providing a nuanced, stakeholder-informed assessment relevant to researchers in environmental policy and sustainability studies.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Understanding and predicting heatwave risk is a societal imperative in the face of climate change. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions impact heat extremes more strongly per unit of mean warming than do greenhouse gases, but the influence of aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern on time-varying heatwave hazard and resulting population exposure has been largely ignored. Aerosols’ spatially heterogeneous forcing is often co-located with population centers due to aerosols’ industrial sources and short atmospheric lifetime, potentially resulting in amplified exposure to aerosol-driven climate effects. Here, we quantify the influence of historical and projected future changes in aerosol emissions through 2100 on global patterns of heatwave hazard (i.e. the frequency of heatwave days) and exposure (i.e. population-weighted hazard) using the NCAR Community Earth System Model v1 single forcing large ensemble (LE). Our results show that increased aerosol emissions since 1920 have suppressed heatwave frequency (HWF) over populated regions by roughly half through present-day—a trend that is now reversing with shifting emission patterns and net global declining emissions. This may already be leading to an aerosol-driven acceleration in HWF, a signal that is amplified in populated regions. Aerosols’ influence on heatwaves is strongly co-located with population, creating out-sized exposure, which evolves through time with aerosols’ evolving emissions pattern within this LE. Our results suggest that near-term changes in aerosol emissions will be a disproportionate driver of trends in heatwave exposure, meriting dedicated future study, and that aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern should be considered in attempts to attribute recent heatwave trends to human activity.",

While previous studies have examined ETS and provincial reduction targets separately, the impacts of the potential integration of these approaches on welfare and the spatial distribution of air quality-related health remain underexplored. In this study, we employ an integrated modeling framework to compare the economic impacts and health outcomes associated with PM2.5 and ozone under three provincial control mechanisms with the same target for national total carbon emissions in 2035. Our findings indicate that ETS improves national welfare by at least US$18.9 billion (0.12%) compared to the conventional provincial control mechanism (PRO_CAP). The partitioned carbon regulation mechanism (PART_REG), which applies the national ETS to power and energy-intensive industry sectors while assigning reduction targets to other sectors at the provincial level, achieves 85% of the welfare improvement observed under full ETS coverage (FULL_ETS). ETS redistributes CO2 and co-emitted air pollutant emissions from northern to southern China, improving air quality in northern provinces but worsening it in central and southern provinces. The national premature deaths increase by 32 700 (95% CI: 23 200–41 600) under PART_REG compared to PRO_CAP. When comparing the changes in welfare and monetized health damages, ETS remains cost-effective nationally, with a median net benefit of US$6.6 billion under PART_REG—20% higher than that under FULL_ETS.

This study examines exposure, vulnerability, and resilience across three consecutive extreme events in the Portland metro area: the September 2020 wildfire-related air pollution, the February 2021 snowstorm, and the June 2021 heatwave. We used geographically weighted regression and Spearman rank correlation analysis to investigate relationships between hazard impacts, the social vulnerability index (SoVI), Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC), and proximity to community-based organizations (CBOs) in 416 census tracts. Our analysis reveals strong spatial correlations between wildfire-related air pollution, winter storm impacts, and extreme heat exposure. Communities already burdened by poor air quality, freezing precipitation, and urban heat island effects faced heightened cumulative risk. While this varied by neighborhood, racial minorities, migrant workers, non-US citizens, and low-income households were significantly affected. In contrast, affluent communities with lower SoVI scores and higher BRIC values exhibited greater resilience and were less exposed to these hazards. Although CBOs were concentrated in areas with high SoVI, they were insufficient in mitigating disaster impacts. This study underscores the urgent need for multi-hazard resilience planning centered on advancing environmental justice, vulnerability reduction, CBO capacity building, and investment in critical infrastructure in at-risk communities.",

      "description": "The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant pattern of atmospheric circulation variability over the North Atlantic region. It influences climate and weather such as surface air temperatures downstream over Eurasia through establishing a large-scale teleconnection, but past studies on the NAO’s downstream teleconnection have been largely limited to observational data, and further evidence of downstream impacts and associated mechanisms from comprehensive climate modeling is desirable. This study quantifies and analyzes this teleconnection on an interannual timescale by using both ERA5 reanalysis, and five large ensembles from four climate simulation models. A particular focus is placed on dynamical pathways, as well as variability among ensemble members that modulates the teleconnection strength. Results suggest that NAO signals are propagated downstream by Rossby waves, efficiently transmitted through waveguides along both the polar and subtropical jet streams to Eastern Eurasia; while heat can be advected weakly from upstream, advection plays a rather local effect inducing temperature anomalies from the Pacific Ocean onshore. Multiple linear regression shows that internal climate variability significantly modulates the teleconnection: a more locally dominant NAO pattern, and narrower waveguides could strengthen the teleconnection. These two factors combine to explain up to 70% of variance in the teleconnection strength, with each contributing almost equally. Reanalysis data marginally agree with the regression model (1.9 standardized residuals higher in strength), suggesting potential model biases in jets and the NAO variability.

      "description": "The transition towards renewable energies together with climate change is rendering electricity systems more vulnerable to climate conditions and trends. This study examines the impacts of recent climate change and variability on run-of-river (RoR) hydropower production and electricity systems planning. We present an end-to-end pipeline to convert runoff and hydropower specifications into hydropower generation and subsequently integrate it into an electricity systems model. Applying this methodology to Switzerland, we provide a re-analysis of hydropower generation for each RoR power plant with capacities of 300 KW or more for the period 1991–2022. When aggregated on a national scale, our estimations match well nationally reported production and displays a climate-driven year-to-year variability. Our results show an overall tendency towards decreased RoR production in the past decades in Switzerland due to climate change (decrease in water availability). This trend was compensated at a national level with an infrastructure expansion. Based on the derived hydropower time series, we simulate the electricity system under scenarios with either no or a high renewable energy target and showcase contrasting sensitivities of electricity prices to climate variability.",

      "description": "New environmental constraints for hydropower improve ecosystems but reduce energy production and flexibility, creating a dilemma between protecting nature and ensuring a sufficient and reliable energy supply. Approximately 88% of Norway’s power comes from hydropower, produced by over 1770 plants. We assess how 285 potential new or revised environmental constraints affect hydropower production and flexibility in the Northern European power system. To do so, we combine a method for estimating environmental flow releases in bypass reaches and stochastic power system optimization. Our results show that reductions in hydropower output due to these constraints are consistent across power system scenarios and two power system models. The reductions amount to 3 TWh yr−1 (2% of Norway’s production), by our estimates. These reductions are primarily driven by flow diversions to bypass river sections. Further, we find that high power prices increase and low prices decrease, reflecting reduced system flexibility. Price increases typically occur in dry spring periods and are linked to activation of season-dependent reservoir restrictions in that period, while price decreases result from higher reservoir volumes entering periods of rain-heavy summer or autumn periods, indirectly linked to restrictions active earlier in the year. In our simulations, we observe that flexibility losses due to environmental constraints to some degree are offset by increased flexible operation of unaffected reservoirs and transmission interconnectors. Finally, our findings suggest that reservoir restrictions may cause spilling, as higher water levels in regulated reservoirs increase the risk of spilling during wet summer or autumn periods. This system-level understanding is crucial for regulatory authorities designing new environmental requirements and revising the terms of hydropower licenses. Our study contributes to informed discussions for balancing hydropower production with local environmental benefits and offers a framework for studying similar constraints in other regions, such as Sweden, North America and European Alpine countries.",

      "description": "Reforestation of degraded riparian areas provides climate mitigation benefits through increased carbon (C) storage. However, the magnitude of this potential natural climate solution (NCS) remains uncertain across ecoregions. Few studies have evaluated riparian planting C sequestration and storage, particularly in highly productive wet riparian ecosystems. In recent decades, riparian reforestation has accelerated in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States, primarily aiming to restore ecosystem functions and associated benefits. Using these plantings as a ‘natural experiment’, we assessed C storage in woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and soils across a chronosequence of PNW riparian reforestation sites. Our study evaluated changes in C storage with planting age and identified key covariates affecting C storage in plants and soils and their relationship with planting age across a ∼430 km latitudinal gradient in western Oregon, USA. We found that woody and soil C stocks increase with planting age, averaging 24% and 1% per year, respectively. Increases in tree C were strongly driven by increasing planting age and tree stem density. Understory C was weakly related to stand characteristics and geomorphic properties, and strongly related to planting age. Soil C gains were positively driven by precipitation. We find that riparian reforestation can result in increased C storage, with woody vegetation comprising most of the increase. Our results highlight the importance of including both trees and shrubs in plantings to realize C accumulation gains in the earlier years. Because C accumulation is gradual, yet compounding (i.e. 10+ and 15+ years for total C stocks to increase by 1.95, and 19.2 Mg C ha−1, respectively), riparian reforestation projects implemented today could take over a decade to deliver high NCS benefits, emphasizing the urgency to implement these projects to limit the worst of climate change impacts.",

      "description": "Sub-daily extreme precipitation events can present significant risks such as flooding and soil erosion. Yet the space time pattern of such events on a global scale and their relationships with temperature and wind speed are not well understood. Based on over 9000 global meteorological stations and multi-source weighted-ensemble precipitation covering the warm seasons of 1980–2022, the characteristics and trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation (3 h time interval) were examined and their relationships with temperature and wind speed were explored across global major river basins. The results revealed a similar spatial pattern in the annual frequency, intensity, duration, and total amount of 3 h extreme precipitation events, though notable discrepancies were observed in specific regions such as Southeast Asia and eastern North America. Over half of the stations, particularly in South America, exhibited decreasing trends in extreme precipitation frequency, while significant increases were documented in Europe and Southeast Asia. The relationship between extreme precipitation intensity and temperature over different river basins exhibited diverse behaviors, characterized by monotonic increase (sub-daily Clausius–Clapeyron scaling, mostly in Europe), hook structure (mostly in North America), monotonic decrease (mostly in Africa), and nearly constant (mostly in Mid East, South Africa and South America). Moreover, wind speed generally increased with extreme precipitation intensity for tropical and subtropical basins, while in high-latitude basins strong winds tended to occur with lower precipitation intensity. These insights are vital for improving resilience against sub-daily extreme precipitation.",
