      "description": "Understanding vegetation sensitivity to drought in South Asia is essential due to the region’s exposure to frequent, seasonally varying drought driven by complex hydroclimatic factors. This study addresses a significant knowledge gap by investigating seasonal vegetation-drought sensitivity using multiple vegetation indicators and the influence of hydroclimatic factors. Our results show vegetation-drought sensitivity peaks in spring, rising from 0.2 in summer to 0.6, with drought-prone areas expanding from 40% to 60%. Along with drought-vegetation sensitivities, the other hydroclimatic factor’s role played a wide range of dependency on the phenological stages of vegetation. For instance, a statistically significant positive correlation between increasing soil moisture–temperature coupling and decreased vegetation growth was detected from spring to summer in Pakistan and India, with an average sensitivity of 0.2–0.6 in all seasons. Vapor pressure deficit dominates vegetation responses, especially in summer and autumn, with central and northwestern croplands showing higher sensitivity, while humid northeastern parts remain resilient. Elevated aCO2 amplifies drought effects in the spring, highlighting the vital role of seasonal water balance and hydroclimatic dynamics. Policy-makers should integrate these insights into regional drought management and climate adaptation strategies to support sustainable agricultural practices and ecosystem conservation.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "High Mountain Asia (HMA) holds the highest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036–2065) and far future (2066–2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adea89",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Efforts to combat land degradation globally have led to the widespread promotion of sustainable land management practices (SLMPs) aimed at reducing surface runoff and erosion. Despite their extensive implementation, long-term evaluations of these practices are limited, especially in data-scarce regions. In our study, we assess the long-term impact of large-scale SLMPs in Ethiopia using remotely sensed data from the past 24 years on 122 watersheds. Using a synthetic control method that does not require an explicit control group, we find statistically significant positive effects of SLMPs in both wet and dry seasons. These benefits persist at least eight years beyond the intervention period. Our findings highlight the need for multi-season impact assessments. Focusing only on the wet season may overlook key outcomes in dryland regions, underestimating the effectiveness of large-scale, multi-year projects. We further find that effects were most positive in drought-prone agricultural highlands, and that some administrative zones appear more effective than others at implementation. Efficient and affordable monitoring of sustainable agricultural water and land management and watershed conservation is crucial for understanding which interventions are effective and can provide opportunities for alternative financing mechanisms.",

      "title": "The hidden role of market-making in the rise of farmed salmon",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adec05",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Aquaculture is expected to play an important role in the transition towards healthy and sustainable diets, requiring dietary changes towards products with lower environmental footprints in ways that address dietary needs. Farmed Atlantic salmon accounts for 2% of global aquaculture, with productivity growth factors, such as research investment, credited with creating a high-value, globalized food commodity. However, its contribution to sustainability and nutrition goals remains unclear, and factors underlying consumer demand, such as marketing work, have been overlooked. We inspect the rise of farmed salmon in the UK, using key stakeholder interviews to understand the role of various actors (e.g. industry, retailers) in ‘making’ farmed salmon markets. Interviewees identified retailer strategies, such as labelling, and consumer-facing promotion efforts, such as health benefits, as key demand-growth factors underlying farmed salmon sales. Using data on UK seafood markets, we assess the views of interviewees, finding that farmed salmon is the most consumed aquatic food; however, it is less popular than other animal-source foods and is primarily consumed by affluent households. Our analyses discuss how market-making efforts by industry and retail actors have shaped consumer demand by promoting salmon as an accessible, nutritious and sustainable product. Accreditation and labelling have helped to develop perceptions of health and sustainability, despite farmed salmon being comparable in nutrient profile to other aquatic foods and having long-standing environmental impacts. Market-making insights could be used to enhance demand for other aquatic foods in ways that target dietary gaps by supplying affordable and sustainable products, such as mussels.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Access to critical and essential services (CES) is vital for community resilience, particularly in coastal areas facing natural hazards. We developed a novel transportation network analysis framework to assess access fragility (in terms of losing access), criticality (in terms of the importance of CES facilities), and equity of CES access across five Louisiana communities. We used drive time to the closest facility, marginal drive time to the second closest facility, and the number of alternatives within critical time thresholds as three measures for fragility analysis. Our findings show that fragility is not limited to rural areas—urban communities experiencing in-migration also face risks due to limited alternatives. Removing one facility at a time revealed that it can cause up to a 500% increase in drive times to dialysis centers and hospitals for residents of Morgan City and Stephensville, while, on average, removing one random high school results in a 6%–30% increase in drive time across communities. We also introduced a criticality ranking method using total population, percentage of the population without an alternative, and marginal drive time for populations without alternatives, and calculated rank stability across different weightings of these three measures to identify facilities that are consistently most critical. Cameron Parish had the highest concentration of critical facilities, though facilities in Slidell and Mandeville also ranked highly, highlighting potential capacity concerns for two communities with growing populations. Finally, our equity analysis, performed using Monte Carlo simulations, shows that Native populations are disproportionately affected by limited access to services (∼29% are identified as outliers for dialysis and hospital access), while White populations experience the lowest average drive times to most CES facilities.",

      "title": "Integrating approaches and methodologies into phenological research in Neotropical dry forests: a systematic review",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ade9e2",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Phenological shifts are increasingly recognized as tangible indicators of plant responses to climate change. Tropical dry forests (TDFs), in particular, are key ecosystems for unraveling the mechanisms driving phenological dynamics, given their crucial role in biodiversity conservation and carbon balance. Although phenological research has advanced rapidly in recent decades in tandem with new methodological innovations, TDFs remain underrepresented. Consequently, the extent to which recent approaches have improved our understanding of leaf changes is still poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of phenology in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) in the Neotropics using Web of Science and Scopus databases up to December 2024. We aimed to synthesize methodological advances, environmental drivers, and functional traits related to phenology, providing insights about mechanisms underlying phenological shifts in Neotropical SDTFs. We documented a significant expansion in phenology research in Neotropical SDTFs over the last decade, with a concentration of studies in South America, particularly Brazil, followed by Central America. Despite these advances, long-term studies remain scarce, limiting our ability to detect interannual variability and long-term trends. The integration of high-resolution monitoring tools, such as phenocameras, has enhanced data collection across spatial and temporal scales, improving our ability to track phenological changes. Furthermore, plant functional traits such as wood density and leaf characteristics associated with deciduousness are key for understanding drought adaptation strategies in dry forests. Given the strong dependence of SDTFs phenological patterns on climate variability, predictive models that incorporate phenological observations, plant functional traits, and climate data will be further crucial for refining our understanding of adaptive mechanisms and improving forecasts of vegetation responses in dry forests. By highlighting research gaps and future directions, this synthesis provides a foundation to improve conservation efforts and climate resilience assessments in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Unprecedented urbanization has led to a sharp increase in the world’s building stock, increasing material consumption and environmental impact. This study introduces CarbonFiberStone (CFS), a novel lightweight construction material, and assesses its carbon footprint in a specific building application. CFS is defined as a millimeter-thin bio-based carbon fiber fabric bonded to compression-resistant stone slabs using an adhesive. CFS is extremely resistant to compression and tension. The resulting stone powder from the stone cutting process is used for enhanced rock weathering. The wall element presented here incorporates a layer of biochar for insulation purposes. Using life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, we compare five CFS-based building blocks with two conventional reinforced concrete blocks in single and multi-story residential buildings. The results show that CFS walls achieve a net carbon negative balance of −56.86–65.32 kg CO2eq m−2, sequestering 0.10–0.15 t CO2 per square meter of living space at similar costs to conventional construction with reinforced concrete. These results show that CFS has the potential to become a viable, sustainable alternative to conventional building materials and thus has the potential to make a significant contribution to the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement.",
