      "description": "Voluntary markets for agricultural carbon credits are expanding, promoting climate-smart practices purported to increase soil carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To contribute effectively to climate mitigation, markets must deliver credits that meet international standards guaranteeing credits are additional, conservative, and equivalent to at least 1 ton of CO2. Yet protocols for quantifying credits make different assumptions, raising questions about whether protocols meet the ‘equivalency standard’. We test for equivalency using a common dataset of 4988 US Midwestern corn-soybean fields, representing a carbon market project, to estimate credit issuances for adoption of no-till plus cover cropping practices. We find issuances, across the three major protocols being used for US croplands, differing for this common project by up to ∼130 000 credits per year. Our ‘Protocol Intercomparison Project’ reveals how quantitative evaluations can identify assumptions generating marked differences in crediting, thereby guiding research that informs protocol revisions to build confidence in mitigation and demonstrating paths forward for protocol harmonization efforts.",

      "title": "A model-based assessment of the regional safe aerosol boundary for the South Asian monsoon region",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Recent papers on planetary and safe Earth System boundaries have proposed a limit of 0.25 for regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) in South Asia (SA) with a zone of uncertainty of 0.25–0.50 to avoid major disruptions to regional hydrology. These values are based on expert judgment, and a rigorous model-based confirmation of these boundary values is lacking in literature. In this paper, we address this important research gap using idealized climate model simulations. We analyze the response of the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation when the regional mean AOD is increased from the modeled present-day value of 0.14 to the proposed planetary boundary values of 0.25 and 0.5. Our simulations confirm that a regional AOD of 0.25 could indeed lead to drought conditions (>10% mean precipitation reduction) in India, while an AOD of 0.5 reduces Indian summer monsoon precipitation by about 19%. The reduction in the summer monsoon precipitation is driven by both fast adjustments (rapid adjustment of the atmosphere to aerosol radiative forcing) and slow responses (responses to changes in sea surface temperature). The rapid adjustment to anthropogenic aerosols, predominantly sulfates, involves enhanced atmospheric stability, subsidence, and suppressed cloud formation and precipitation. The slow response involves zonal surface temperature gradients between the North Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean leading to changes in the Walker circulation, anomalous subsidence over SA, and a decrease in monsoon precipitation. Enhanced aerosol loading over SA reduces monsoon precipitation, regardless of aerosol composition, though the magnitude of reduction depends on whether the aerosols are primarily reflective or absorbing. Our findings confirm the risk of major disruptions to regional hydrology in SA when regional aerosol loading exceeds the boundary values. Future studies should assess the robustness of our results using other climate models and for other monsoon regions.",

      "description": "The aim of this project was to assess and summarise the evidence on the health equity impacts of climate change in the UK. We conducted a rapid systematic review (search up to: February 2024) of primary studies reporting on the health impacts of climate change exposure pathways (hazards; health risks; solutions and responses) for populations at-risk of experiencing health inequalities, identified using the Core20PLUS framework (people experiencing the greatest deprivation; people from protected characteristics groups related to ethnicity, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, and religion or belief; people from inclusion health groups). Of the 20 014 records identified, 24 were included. Of these, 20 reported on people experiencing the greatest deprivation, with some evidence that increase in ambient temperature, extreme cold, and extreme heat had similar impacts on mortality in the most and least deprived areas. No conclusions could be drawn for this population group for other outcomes or exposures due to the limited number of studies identified and their methodological quality. In people experiencing homelessness, 2 studies reported that increase in ambient temperature was associated with adverse health impacts but the disproportionate impact on this population group was not assessed. No conclusions could be drawn for ethnic minority groups or people with drug and/or alcohol dependence due to the limited evidence identified. No studies were identified for the remaining population groups. In conclusion, we identified important evidence gaps and methodological limitations of the existing evidence on the health equity impacts of climate change in the UK that should be used to inform future research in this area.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Peatlands in Southeast Asia regularly experience fire due to clearance of forests and drainage for agriculture and plantation development. Fire represents a mainstay for rural communities managing tropical landscapes, but these can lead to uncontrolled ‘wild’ fires that pose a major threat to people and the ecosystem, leading to a cycle of increased susceptibility to fire and increased vulnerability of people and peat ecosystem to future fires. Using an exposure-sensitivity-adaptive capacity framework, we constructed indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of peatlands and communities to fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) and used these indicators to calculate the social and ecological vulnerability of peatlands and communities to fires. We operationalized this framework and defined spatial indicators which we used to construct three indices of vulnerability (ecological vulnerability, social vulnerability of villages to burning, and social vulnerability of villages to smoke-haze). Our assessment found peatlands with high ecological vulnerability on eastern Sumatra (Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra), southern Kalimantan (Central and South Kalimantan), and East Kalimantan. Majority of these provinces overlapped with sites of high social vulnerability for burning (North Sumatra, Riau, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan) and high social vulnerability for smoke-haze (Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan). As districts play an important role in land use decisions and fire mitigation efforts, we identified the top six districts that had high numbers of villages with high ecological and social vulnerability scores. Hotspot analyses showed that ecological vulnerability hotspots were co-located with social vulnerability hotspots but clusters of social vulnerability hotspots for burning did not necessarily overlap with social vulnerability hotspots for smoke-haze. Our vulnerability assessment of peatlands and villages is the foundation for an important tool for policymakers at multiple governance levels to identify high ecological and social vulnerability to peatland fires and channel aid and mitigation efforts where they are most needed.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate warming in the Arctic is very strong compared to other regions on Earth. Arctic winter climate and cryosphere conditions are changing towards more frequent mild spells. Precipitation is often falling as rain, followed by the formation of basal ice on frozen ground, particularly in Gulf Stream-influenced climates as in Svalbard. Such conditions encapsulate tundra plants in ice for several months, which is assumed to reduce land surface greenness due to plant damage. We investigated whether extensive basal ice (presence and thickness) and increased summer temperatures (growing degree days (GDD)) from in-situ time series impact satellite-derived land surface greenness. We measured greenness as the magnitude and timing of growing season maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our study covers Svalbard from 2013 to 2023, a decade with record breaking summer temperatures and many icy winters. We found lower maximum NDVI values when basal ice was present only at higher elevations (Estimated effect size: −0.0119, 95% CI: −0.0207 to −0.0031). We further found an eight-day advance in the timing of maximum NDVI (Estimated effect size: −7.56, 95% CI: −14.81 to −0.31) with basal ice presence in the region that was characterized by spatially and temporally extensive basal ice. Ice thickness, in contrast to presence, or GDD did not influence the magnitude or timing of maximum NDVI. Taken together, our findings indicate that basal ice presence could become a driver of vegetation change in the High Arctic as climatic extremes intensify, which could alter tundra greenness over larger landscapes and ultimately influence Arctic food webs.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "As data-driven weather forecasting models increasingly come in operational use, questions of fairness and equitable access to forecast improvements are gaining urgency. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for evaluating outcome-based fairness in global data-driven forecasts, drawing on principles from the algorithmic fairness literature. Specifically, we focus on two criteria: statistical parity (i.e. comparable improvements across protected groups) and conditional independence (i.e. no dependence of improvements on protected variables). Using ECMWF’s AIFS model as a case study and IFS HRES as a baseline, we assess whether forecast improvements are equitably distributed across different income groups and population densities. We find that although AIFS provides substantial overall improvements in forecast skill, these gains are unevenly distributed: on average, wealthier and more densely populated areas are more likely to experience forecast improvements, violating group fairness and conditional independence criteria. We conclude by discussing how fairness-aware loss functions could be incorporated into data-driven weather forecasting systems and argue for a broader integration of fairness considerations into model development and evaluation.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Reservoirs are designed to mitigate water and energy crises during droughts, yet their conditions—such as fullness and fluctuations during droughts remain underexplored. In particular, our understanding of how these conditions are related to reservoir function, size, location, climate, and socio-economic context remains limited. Here, we assess the storage conditions of 6634 global reservoirs during major river basin-scale droughts using normalized storage (NS; storage-to-capacity ratio). River basin-scale drought spells were identified using a 6 month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during 1999–2018. Our results showed that reservoirs in Asia had the lowest NS levels during droughts compared to other continents. Reservoirs in Africa and Asia exhibited the largest fluctuations, with median NS fluctuations of 34% and 37%, respectively. Large capacity reservoirs demonstrated greater resilience, whereas smaller reservoirs fluctuated more. Irrigation reservoirs had the lowest NS levels (49%) and the greatest NS fluctuations (33%). Reservoirs in dry climate remained the least filled, with irrigation reservoirs consistently showing the largest fluctuations across all climate zones. We found that reservoirs located in economically stronger countries tend to maintain higher storage levels (61% vs. 46%) and lower fluctuations (23% vs. 33%) during droughts. Furthermore, almost 40% of all reservoirs exhibited a significant (p-value < 0.05) correlation between NS and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), highlighting the association between large-scale climate variability and reservoir storage dynamics. Overall, our study provides valuable observational insights that can guide targeted management strategies and contribute to sustainable, long-term water governance.",

      "title": "Denitrification in biogeochemical models—challenges and advances in simulating N2 and N2O emission in agricultural systems",
      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae2494",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Denitrification represents a major nitrogen (N) loss pathway in agriculture, reducing plant N uptake, lowering crop N use efficiency, while emitting the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, due to methodological challenges, field measurements of N2 emissions remain rare, leaving denitrification losses poorly characterised across most cropping systems and comprehensive N budgets lacking. This constrains parameterization and validation of biogeochemical models, impeding efforts to forecast denitrification losses under changing conditions and design effective mitigation strategies. This study (i) reviewed the current literature on field-based N2 measurements, (ii) tested the ability of five different models to accurately simulate denitrification losses, and (iii) simulated denitrification losses from agricultural soils in Germany using gridded and point-based modelling frameworks. Results show that field studies suitable for model calibration remain scarce and mostly limited to temperate systems. Simulated cumulative N2 emissions varied widely between models, ranging from 0.89 to 6.07 kg N ha−1, far below the observed N2 emissions of 21 ± 3 kg N ha−1. The ratio of N2O to (N2O + N2) emitted ( ), a key determinant of the climate impact of denitrification, was not only strongly overestimated by all models but also exhibited considerable variations, ranging from 0.056 to 0.707, compared to the measured ratio of 0.006. Models also failed to capture expected responses of to environmental drivers. For Germany, simulated average N2 emissions from agricultural soils ranged from 1.7 to 14.5 kg N ha−1yr−1, with corresponding ratios ranging from 0.18 to 0.59. Spatial patterns of emissions also differed significantly across modelling frameworks, reflecting large structural uncertainties. These findings highlight that both N2 emissions and ratios remain poorly represented in current models, severely limiting our ability to establish reliable N budgets and develop targeted N management strategies. Coordinated advancements in field-based measurements and modelling are urgently needed to improve the representation of denitrification in biogeochemical models.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae2637",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is a key nature-based solution to mitigate climate change. Previous studies have highlighted its potential and the role of improve management practice, but many relied on static land-use assumptions or limited spatial data, overlooking socio-economic and climate-driven changes that affect land availability. This study assessed the global SOC sequestration potential of cropland and bioenergy land under three land-use pathways: business as-usual (BAU), a sustainable food system (FOOD), and a 2 °C climate target (2°). Our results show that both climate and food policies may influence SOC sequestration through land-use changes. Under the 2 °C scenario, large-scale expansion of bioenergy crops could increase SOC stocks by about 7% (∼9 Gt CO2). In contrast, the FOOD scenario achieves only modest SOC gains, slightly lower than BAU (−1.59 Gt CO2). This because dietary shifts reduce pasture demand but do not significantly change cropland area, and bioenergy deployment is limited. While plant-based diets improve food system efficiency and reduce emissions, their SOC benefits are indirect and depend on how freed-up land is used for mitigation, such as afforestation or bioenergy production. Regions with significant bioenergy expansion—such as Latin America, reforming economies, and OECD/EU countries—show the highest SOC gains. Regions with large cropland areas, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, contribute 70% of the global potential. Moreover substantial SOC potential can be realized at a cost below $100 per ton of CO2, highlighting SOC sequestration as a feasible and economically viable climate mitigation strategy. Our study findings underscore the trade-offs between food system transformation, land-use efficiency, and carbon storage, and emphasize that climate policies promoting bioenergy expansion can achieve substantial SOC gains, while dietary policies alone have limited impact if without strategic land management.",
