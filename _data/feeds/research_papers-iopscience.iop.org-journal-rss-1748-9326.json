      "description": "Millions of Californians live behind levees constructed to redirect water and prevent floods. Accurate assessments of these levees are crucial in flood hazard maps, which underpin federal floodplain regulations and insurance rates provided by the National Flood Insurance Program. However, when the federal government digitized California’s flood maps in the 2000s, it used a simplistic binary procedure that assessed levees as either meeting the minimum standards for accreditation or not. This study investigates the consequences of the ‘without levee’ procedure, which mapped flood risk as if non-accredited levees did not exist and shaped the 100 year flood zone in California. We combine publicly available datasets on levee systems, flood insurance enrollment, and demographics behind levees. We find that non-accredited levees outnumber accredited levees by a factor of 10-to-1, but accredited levees are concentrated in urban areas and protect more people and assets. Our results demonstrate that households behind non-accredited levees effectively cross-subsidize flood insurance costs in leveed areas—between 2009 and 2020, households behind non-accredited levees paid twice as much for flood insurance premiums than if their levee were accredited and they were removed from the flood zone. While Risk Rating 2.0 insurance pricing is narrowing the premium gap, accreditation continues to shape the 100 year flood zone, with enduring economic implications.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae2af6",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a critical role in mitigating the negative impacts of critical mineral mining. Yet research offers limited insight into how societal pressures shape the responsiveness and effectiveness of CSR in this sector. Empirical study is further constrained by selective corporate disclosure, inconsistent datasets, and unreliable interview evidence. To address these challenges, this study applies topic modeling, a form of natural language processing, to stakeholder communication data. Focusing on the Chilean lithium mining industry from 2010 to 2022, the analysis examines how a leading mining company pursued and operationalized CSR through its annual sustainability reports. The findings show that the company’s CSR efforts appear linked to societal pressures, particularly regulatory fines, activism, environmental scrutiny, and investor demands. Persistent drivers included water conflicts, legal actions, and policy changes. The study also demonstrates that topic modeling offers a useful tool for identifying and tracking CSR priorities over time, yielding insights less accessible through conventional research approaches.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Multiyear sea ice replenishment due to first-year ice aging at the end of the summer is a key factor in maintaining the overall Arctic sea ice mass balance. Utilizing satellite observations from 2000 to 2023, here we show that a significant poleward shift in the multiyear ice replenishment occurs in the north pole region (NPR) of the Arctic (north of 80 ̊N). The large-scale atmospheric circulation mode, characterized by an extensive and persistent high-pressure (low-pressure) pattern on the Siberia (North America) side, is responsible for the poleward shift of multiyear ice (MYI) replenishment. Associated with the poleward expansion of the multiyear sea ice replenishment, a significant decline in sea ice thickness over the central Arctic and reduced sea ice volume flux via the Fram Strait are identified. Moreover, a strengthened (weakened) connection between summer melting (winter freezing) conditions and MYI replenishment variability is outlined. This indicates that the Arctic sea ice is less resilient to warming than previous reports.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Most studies examining demographic disparities in the distribution of environmental burdens have examined only one burden at a time. Few have examined how multiple burdens are concentrated and distributed among the American population. The objective of this study was to examine how multiple (13) environmental burdens are concentrated and how concentrated burdens are associated with where vulnerable populations reside. We utilized nationally consistent data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen database. EJScreen includes 13 environmental burden indicators and five racial/ethnic and socioeconomic indicators. The concentration of environmental burdens was examined by taking into account both the intensity of individual burdens and the count of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds. Graphical and statistical analyses were used to determine how percentages of vulnerable populations varied as the intensity levels and counts of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increased. We found that concentrations of vulnerable populations increase as intensity levels of individual environmental burdens increase and as the number of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increases. In most cases these increases are monotonic and highly statistically significant. Among the five demographic categories examined, the strongest relationships were found for percent people of color, followed by percent with limited English. Weaker but statistically significant relationships were found between other socioeconomic categories and increases in the intensities and counts of environmental burdens. Until recently, nationally consistent data for multiple environmental burdens were not available. Applying the 13 environmental indicators in EJScreen demonstrates that a strong relationship exists between where multiple burdens are simultaneously concentrated and where vulnerable populations reside. That this relationship is stronger for racial/ethnic categories than for other socioeconomic categories reflects outcomes of a history of public policies that have segregated and disadvantaged certain populations in the U.S.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Antarctic Ice Sheet is a critical driver of global sea level rise, yet future projections of Antarctic precipitation remain highly uncertain, posing challenges to modeling ice sheet changes. This study examines uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation projections using simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and investigates their underlying sources. We find that uncertainties in precipitation projections are substantially larger than those for surface temperature. Integrated precipitation uncertainties are strongly linked to uncertainties in both global and Antarctic surface temperatures, while atmospheric circulation—particularly the Pacific South American modes—plays a critical role in regional precipitation patterns of precipitation uncertainties. Further analysis reveals that tropical sea surface temperatures contribute to uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation patterns through atmospheric teleconnections. These findings highlight the need to improve polar processes in climate models to reduce uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation projections and better predict ice sheet contributions to sea level rise.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Inequality in the provision of urban green spaces (UGS) poses a growing obstacle to achieving sustainable development goals and building inclusive and resilient urban environments. However, the key drivers of UGS development and the extent to which their relative importance in different urban contexts remain unclear. This study provides a global analysis of the socio-economic, geographical, and climate determinants of UGS inequality across 11 528 cities by assessing dynamic changes in UGS against the global average. We find that cities in Asia and Africa (6414 cities of 78 countries) are generally converging toward the global mean from below, while those in North America and Europe (1416 cities of 46 countries) gradually lost their relative advantages in UGS development. The relative greenness in 13% of the study cities were mainly influenced by built-up area per capita, in 35% by night lightening index, in 9% by GDP per capita, and in 22% by precipitation. We identified three dominant typologies of drivers: those tied to economic intensity GDP per capita, urbanization pressure (nighttime light index), and biophysical constraints (biome & built-up area). These typologies align with urban developmental pathways from take-off to mature stabilization, revealing a spectrum of stage-specific challenges. These findings underscore that effective UGS strategies should be tailored to local contexts, make reasonable use of urban ecological endowments, adapt to climate constraints, and integrate green space planning into the specific stage of urban development.",

      "title": "Unraveling the anisotropic pattern of track uncertainty in tropical cyclones",
      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae20a9",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The position uncertainty of tropical cyclones (TCs) may stretch along specific directions, yet the global pattern of the dominant direction of uncertainty remains unclear. This study proposes an analogue ensemble algorithm based on historical best-track data to quantify TC track uncertainties in the along-track (AT) and cross-track (CT) directions. The results reveal a strong latitudinal variation in the dominant direction of uncertainty: AT uncertainty is larger near the equator and within the mid-latitude westerlies, whereas CT uncertainty increases in recurvature zones. Moreover, the ratio of CT to AT uncertainty exhibits a negative correlation with TC translation speed. A comparable anisotropic pattern of track uncertainty is also identified in multi-model ensemble forecasts, indicating that the state-dependent preferred direction of position variability is a natural characteristic of TC track predictions. These findings provide the global-scale quantification of intrinsic anisotropic TC track uncertainty and highlight the importance of representing anisotropic uncertainty in probabilistic risk assessment and operational forecasting.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Mining is a rapidly expanding driver of tropical deforestation, yet the scale of its offsite impacts on deforestation and degradation at biome scale remain poorly quantified, especially across sub-Saharan Africa. We focus on understanding these national-scale mining impacts in Côte d’Ivoire, which is a global biodiversity hotspot within the Upper Guinean Forests that has lost >80% of its forest cover since 1960. We combine high-resolution land-use maps with a staggered difference-in-differences approach to assess deforestation and degradation dynamics after mine openings in the Côte d’Ivoire tropical moist forest (TMF) zone between 2001 and 2020. We identify 446 mining clusters, which together directly caused the loss of 5631 ha of forest. We estimate that the total effects extended far beyond mine sites, causing an additional 4.8 percentage-point increase in deforestation within 5 km over 10 years compared to unmined areas. Crucially, for every hectare of deforested land directly cleared for mining, 163 ha were deforested for other, indirect end uses—primarily agricultural and urban expansion linked to mining activity. There was little evidence of significant increases in forest degradation triggered by mining. Our results demonstrate that the true environmental impact of mining vastly exceeds the mine footprint itself and underscores the grave threat that mining poses to moist tropical forests. We recommend the urgent development of national policies and revisions to the mining code to acknowledge the wide area of effect that mining creates, and embedding mitigation efforts to minimise spillover impacts into adjacent forests.",

      "link": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae23e7",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Surface ozone (O3) pollution poses well-documented threats to global ecosystems and public health. While stratospheric intrusion is regarded as an important source of surface O3, its contribution to O3 concentrations is typically small compared to local near-surface photochemical processes. However, a severe O3 pollution event occurred in China’s Pearl River Delta region with O3 concentrations increasing by 28.2 μg m−3 during September 2–4, 2024. Our Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model analysis indicates that the maximum contribution of stratospheric origin air masses can reach 71.0% due to a distant-source transport of stratospheric intrusion caused by super typhoon YAGI. Distinct from conventional localized stratospheric intrusion, this distant-source transport, driven by a typhoon and mid-latitude systems, enables vertical transport and horizontal delivery exceeding 2000 km, with typhoon-induced subsidence completing the grounding of stratospheric O3. These findings reveal a new dynamic mechanism of vertical downward transport for stratospheric mass and underscore the necessity of joint prevention measures against stratospheric intrusion. Failure to elucidate the mechanisms against the backdrop of a projected increase in super typhoon events may lead to a severe underestimation of stratospheric intrusion contributions to tropospheric ozone pollution.",
