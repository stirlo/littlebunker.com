      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate change is reducing the extent of cold aquatic habitats and their unique biodiversity in mountain areas. However, a variety of cold rocky landforms (CRLs) are thermally buffered and feed cold springs (<2 °C) that may represent climate refugia for cold-adapted organisms. These landforms, hitherto overlooked by freshwater research, include rock glaciers, debris-covered glaciers, talus slopes, protalus ramparts, and young moraines. Here, we investigated the warm-season water temperature of 228 springs from clean (ice) glaciers, CRLs, and reference slopes (not sourced by any of these features) in 13 mountain ranges of Europe, South America, and North America. Only springs from glaciers (90%) and CRLs (45%) had average stream temperatures below the thermal optimum for coldwater organisms of 2 °C. Springs fed by CRLs were 3 °C–5 °C (up to 9 °C) colder than those from nearby reference slopes. In general, cold springs were rarer in Mediterranean/semi-arid climates than in temperate and sub-polar climates. Landforms comprising barren and coarse rocky surfaces or ice/rock mix, having a simple or absent soil/vegetation structure, and higher likelihood of permafrost more often supported cold springs. When water temperatures were compared to air temperature, most CRL springs were thermally buffered against warm periods, cumulative heat, and daily temperature fluctuations. With cold conditions maintained in a variety of climates and mountain landscapes, CRL springs in mountains likely have high conservation value. We call for integrated ecological and hydrological research for these ecosystems, aimed at understanding their potential as climate refugia.",

      "title": "Uneven impacts of divergent El Niño and Indian Ocean Dipole on Equatorial Asian fires",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf869",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Equatorial Asian fires are strongly influenced by teleconnections associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Additionally, fire intensity in this region varies depending on the specific type of El Niño event, namely the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño and the Central Pacific (CP) El Niño. However, their distinct impacts and localized variations remain insufficiently understood. Using both reanalysis and future projection data, we investigated the distinct influences of the EP and CP El Niño, as well as the IOD, on potential fire occurrences. Our results indicate that both types of El Niño significantly enhance fire activity in southern Equatorial Asia, with a stronger impact associated with the EP El Niño, whereas the IOD primarily affects the southwestern and south-central regions. These fire patterns are closely linked to large-scale atmospheric circulation changes, particularly modifications in the Walker and Hadley circulations, which influence regional precipitation and atmospheric subsidence, thereby altering vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture availability. Furthermore, fire-prone conditions in Equatorial Asia are modulated by land-atmosphere coupling, with the EP El Niño and IOD intensifying surface drying and heat stress, while the CP El Niño exhibits a weaker influence. Moreover, we found that the relationships between these three climate variabilities and Equatorial Asian fires are projected to intensify, with the IOD’s influence expanding geographically in the future. Our findings provide a foundation for improving fire prediction and enhancing our understanding of climate-driven fire variability in Equatorial Asia under both historical conditions and future climate scenarios.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adfcea",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "In the Anthropocene, soil moisture emerged as a critical tipping component in the stability of Earth’s systems. Within the planetary boundary framework, which defines safe operational limits for human activity to sustain the stability of the Earth system, soil moisture plays an essential role as a core component of the water cycle. It governs key ecohydrological processes, regulates land-atmosphere energy exchange, and supports carbon and water cycling, which are vital for climate resilience and biodiversity. This study explores global, regional, and river basin scale changes in soil moisture, hot spot regions of soil moisture change, and its multifaceted influence across several planetary boundaries, particularly those related to freshwater availability, land-system change, and climate regulation. Reanalysis and remote sensing evidence reveal significant declines in soil moisture across major global river basins, driven by intensifying climate change and land use transformations. These shifts signal increasing pressure from human activities on Earth system resilience and highlight the urgent need to integrate soil moisture into global sustainability assessments. Recognizing soil moisture as a dynamic and interconnected boundary variable is essential for enhancing environmental monitoring, maintaining ecological balance, informing policy interventions, and safeguarding the planet’s life-support systems in an era of accelerating change.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adeeab",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies like enhanced weathering and river/ocean alkalinity enhancement have been suggested to increase alkalinity in rivers, coastal areas, and eventually oceans. The effectiveness and sustainability of these CDR approaches depend on the persistence of added alkalinity, since exceeding certain Ω-thresholds for a given water composition may lead to carbonates formation, causing the loss of previously added alkalinity. In this research, stability of alkalinity was tested using incubation experiments with Elbe estuary freshwater from two seasons (March and August). Alkalinity was increased up to 4000 μmol kgw−1, with varying salinity from 0 to 16. This study shows that the stability of alkalinity depends on the presence and quantity of suspended particles, seasonality of water chemistry, and salinity. Based on the experimental data, the Elbe estuary may take up additional alkalinity in the freshwater part, corresponding to ∼3.0 MtCO2 yr−1 being transported towards the North Sea. Estimates of alkalinity additions from the 1970s to 2010s show a decreasing potential due to changes in pCO2 and pH. The upper geochemical limit for transporting additional alkalinity through estuarine systems serves as a critical boundary. Environmentally feasible levels may be lower than identified here and depend on environmental regulations.",

      "title": "Assessing innovation in the nascent value chains of climate-mitigating technologies",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf763",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Accelerating climate-mitigating technology, or climate-tech, innovation in the formative phase of the technology life cycle is crucial to meeting climate policy goals. During this period, firms create value across a broad set of products related to hardware, software, and services. We conceptualize this as a nascent value chain, operationalize this concept by identifying a set of product clusters, and explore the patterns of innovation within and across them. Specifically, we analyze 14 climate-tech sectors using a dataset of 12 929 early-stage private investments in 3662 North American firms between 2006 and 2021. Descriptions of these firms reveal that innovation occurs in five distinct product clusters across the value chain. Within this dataset, only 15% of firms develop end products (i.e., downstream products bought by consumers), while 59% support these end products through components, manufacturing processes, or optimization products, and 26% develop business services. The temporal evolution of investments in these product clusters reveals three patterns of innovation among climate-tech sectors: maturing innovation (e.g., energy efficiency), characterized by coalescence around the dominant design of an end product with an increasing share of investments in optimization and services; ongoing innovation (e.g., energy storage), characterized by multiple waves of investments in evolving products enabled by flexible policy frameworks; and emerging innovation (e.g., agriculture), characterized by recent growth in investments across most product clusters and spillovers from other sectors. These patterns of innovation indicate ways that firms can add value to new climate-tech as it develops from the formative phase to the growth phase. An understanding of nascent value chains can inform policy design that supports climate-tech scaling by identifying underfunded product clusters and supporting development of a full value chain rather than only end products.",

      "title": "Climate change and federal aid disbursements after Hurricane Harvey: an extreme event attribution analysis",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adf978",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The role climate change plays in increasing the burden placed on governments and insurers to pay for recovery has not been extensively explored and is the focus of this study. This study examines the impacts of climate change attributed flooding on federal disaster aid disbursement in Harris County, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Our approach uses flood models to estimate the amount of flood damages attributable and not attributable to climate change under two climate change attribution scenarios from peer reviewed studies: 20% and 38% increases in rainfall associated with the hurricane due to climate change. These estimates are combined with census tract-level disbursement data for FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Individual Assistance (IA) part of the Individuals and Households Program. We employ spatial lag regression models with direct and spatial spillover effects to analyze the relationship between a tract’s flood damages—both attributed and not attributed to climate change—and federal disaster aid. We find that both types of flood damage shape federal aid disbursements, but that climate change attributed damages tend to have larger effect sizes (elasticities) especially for IA. Specifically, for a 1% increase in additional climate change attributed damages per household in a census tract (under the 20% scenario), expected NFIP levels in that census tract are 0.26% higher and IA levels are 0.3% higher. Implications center on federal funding in an era of climate change.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adfa3b",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Several, more recent global warming projections in the coupled model intercomparison project 6 contain extensions beyond year 2100–2300/2500. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in these projections shows transitions to extremely weak overturning below the surface mixed layer (<6 Sv; 1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1) in all models forced by a high-emission (SSP585) scenario and sometimes also forced by an intermediate- (SSP245) and low-emission (SSP126) scenario. These extremely weak overturning states are characterised by a shallow maximum overturning at depths less than 200 m and a shutdown of the circulation associated with North Atlantic deep water formation. Northward Atlantic heat transport at 26°N decreases to 20%–40% of the current observed value. Heat release to the atmosphere north of 45°N weakens to less than 20% of its present-day value and in some models completely vanishes, leading to strong cooling in the subpolar North Atlantic and Northwest Europe. In all cases, these transitions to a weak and shallow AMOC are preceded by a mid-21st century collapse of maximum mixed-layer depth in Labrador, Irminger and Nordic Seas. The convection collapse is mainly caused by surface freshening from a decrease in northward salt advection due to the weakening AMOC but is likely initiated by surface warming. Maximum mixed-layer depths in the observations are still dominated by internal variability but notably feature downward trends over the last 5–10 years in all deep mixing regions for all data products analysed. This could be merely variability but is also consistent with the model-predicted decline of deep mixing.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Water scarcity is an escalating environmental challenge, particularly in semi-arid regions like Spain, where balancing human and ecosystem needs is critical for sustainable development. Freshwater ecosystems are vital for biodiversity, water security, and economic systems, but often lose protection during droughts. Spain, largely under a Mediterranean climate, shows strong interdependence between ecological and socioeconomic systems, with agriculture, tourism, and energy sectors heavily reliant on scarce water resources. Spain’s economy has thrived on water-dependent activities yet increasing droughts and infrastructure limits are pushing ecosystems toward collapse, with severe biodiversity loss and irreversible damage. Furthermore, investments aimed at increasing water-use efficiency often backfire, leading to expanded irrigation without real water savings. Climate change, urbanization, and pollution exacerbate these tensions, posing risks to public health and economic stability. Transformative strategies are urgently needed: protecting and restoring ecosystems, promoting conservation agriculture, regulating water-intensive industries, and planning collective responses to illegal water use. Simply increasing supply or reacting to crises without systemic change of water demands will not ensure future water security. Spain’s experience highlights the urgent need for integrated management of natural and human systems to preserve freshwater resources, biodiversity, and economic resilience.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyse a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ‘Turing-evades-tipping’). Additionally, we identify a novel ‘Turing-triggers-tipping’ mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/addedd",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Methane super-emitter events (>100 kg methane hr−1) are prevalent across the oil and gas supply chain and are being targeted for methane mitigation policies due to their climate impacts; however, few studies have evaluated the air quality impacts and direct safety and public health risks. Here, we evaluate seven upstream oil and gas methane super-emitter events to examine the safety (explosivity) risks from methane and the short-term, noncancer health risks from benzene and other key co-emitted non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). We used airborne instrument and satellite-measured methane emissions rates to estimate hourly air concentrations of methane using US EPA’s American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD), a regulatory-grade dispersion model, and applied estimated speciated NMVOC-methane molar ratios to calculate hourly air concentrations of NMVOCs. We assessed when and where hourly modeled methane and NMVOC air concentrations exceeded national safety (0.5% methane) and state-based health (8 ppb and 53 ppb benzene) benchmarks. Large methane super-emitters (>2900 kg hr−1) had safety benchmark exceedances as far as 270 m from the source, indicating that safety risks are greatest for facility workers and nearby communities. Health benchmark exceedances were the greatest and most frequent close to the source (<300 m), but, in contrast to the safety risks, reached beyond one kilometer (1.1–19 km) for modeled methane super-emitters (210–15 800 kg hr−1), posing health risks to residents and sensitive populations. We also found that smaller methane super-emitters may pose outsized health risks: our second lowest methane emission case (539 kg hr−1) yielded the highest benzene air concentration (28 000 ppb), farthest 8 ppb benzene exceedance distance (19 km), and highest frequency of health benchmark exceedances between 1–5 km (2.6%). Our study demonstrates that policies and early detection efforts that control methane super-emitters should prioritize factors beyond methane emissions rate magnitude, such as gas composition, to provide the strongest co-benefits for public health and safety.",
