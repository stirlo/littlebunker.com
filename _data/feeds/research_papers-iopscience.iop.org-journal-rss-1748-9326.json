      "title": "Energy production and inter-farm wake losses in future North Sea wind farms",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/add8a2",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The deployment of new wind farms in the North Sea is an essential part of Europe’s transition to low-emission energy sources. Here, we use the mesoscale climate model COSMO-CLM to simulate the energy production of a realistic 92 GW wind farm expansion scenario and compare it with that of the wind farm distribution in 2024. The simulations indicate that added inter-farm wakes would cause the annual energy production of 25 out of 69 operational wind farms to decline by over 5%, with 13 of them experiencing reductions exceeding 10%. These annual losses are composed of intermittent wake periods characterized by large production deficits. For instance, the planned Princess Elisabeth zone in Belgian waters is expected to reduce the output of the existing Belgian wind farm cluster by more than 15% during one out of every five 24 h periods with high production potential (  ms−1). Despite these enhanced inter-farm interactions, we find that the overall capacity factor over the basin increases by 1.6%pt after expansion due to the deployment of next-generation turbines and installation at low capacity densities in high-resource zones. However, negative impacts are highly region-dependent and many wind farms may face substantial losses. Although more validation studies are recommended to further constrain the uncertainty on the presented results, this work demonstrates the need for a coordinated wind farm expansion strategy, especially because spatial constraints are expected to intensify on the path to surpassing 200 GW of capacity in the North Sea by 2050.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Agricultural land abandonment presents potential environmental benefits through either revegetation, and associated carbon sequestration, habitat and landscape connectivity benefits, or recultivation, which offsets the need for agricultural conversion of natural areas. Yet, the extent and pace of land abandonment depends on future demand for food, energy, and other anthropogenic drivers. Here we quantify the extent and spatial distribution of agricultural abandonment and conversion in the southeastern US under a range of future development scenarios, addressing (1) what is the extent of future agricultural abandonment and conversion, (2) how much forecast agricultural conversion could be offset by recultivation of abandoned land, and (3) within a given development scenario, how do different strategies for recultivation of abandoned lands influence (a) habitat fragmentation and (b) connectivity for the umbrella species Ursus americanus. Future abandonment ranged from 1.63 Mha (local economic scenario) to 7.95 Mha (local environmental scenario). Future conversion ranged from 1.24 Mha (global environmental scenario) to 5.65 Mha (global economic scenario). While environmental scenarios predicted surplus abandonment available to offset all conversion, economic scenarios predicted enough abandonment to offset a third of conversion at most. Within a given development scenario, strategic recultivation targeting carbon or biodiversity conservation can reduce fragmentation by up to 17% compared to land-use decisions that do not consider those characteristics. However, strategic recultivation did not significantly affect connectivity, which was instead driven by development scenarios: cost-weighted distance to least-cost path ratio was highest in the economic development scenarios and lowest in the environmental concern scenarios. Our results suggest that while socio-economic development scenarios are the primary drivers of land-use change patterns and the attendant ecological consequences, strategic recultivation decisions targeting carbon sequestration or biodiversity potential can reduce habitat fragmentation within development scenarios.",

      "description": "Both anthropologists and ecologists have increasingly recognized the need to reach beyond their own disciplinary frameworks when handling processes of marginalization that involve intersecting social–ecological dimensions, particularly as global environmental challenges force humans and wildlife into new and challenging conditions. In this letter, we suggest a cross-disciplinary framework for studying the social–ecological margins. We highlight two definitions of marginality, one from the social sciences and one from the natural sciences, and discuss the relations that render a research subject marginal through four case studies on wildlife and agriculture. This discussion illuminates the importance of studying the behavioral and cultural repertoires with which marginal populations respond to social–ecological constraints.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Forests are in decline worldwide due to human activities such as agricultural expansion, urbanization, and mineral extraction. Forest loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and logging, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies. Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat, Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a 1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation, logging, settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7000 reference samples to train a global neural network model that classifies the driver of tree cover loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Our results show that permanent agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing 35% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of tree cover loss vary by region, with the leading driver identified as logging in Europe, permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity targets.",

      "description": "The idea of weak sustainability posits that the exploitation of a natural resource, even if it depletes it, could be accompanied by investments in man-made forms of capital that may help maintain human wellbeing in the long run. Here, we conduct an initial test of the empirical evidence that such investments were made in the context of groundwater extraction in India. Irrigation with groundwater has played a crucial role in India’s rural development, but also made it the world’s largest consumer of groundwater with fast depleting aquifers. We test whether in locations that have extracted greater amounts of water between 1966–2009, there are indications of greater accumulation of household level physical (assets) and human (education and health) capital, presumably through the investment of income generated from irrigation. We document positive correlations between groundwater utilization and the accumulation of physical assets. The results are more mixed for correlations with health and learning outcomes, which are likely the most important for the diversification of income away from farming once irrigation is no longer viable.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Global warming is a main cause for current ocean deoxygenation. A deployment of marine carbon dioxide removal (CDR) for mitigating global warming could therefore also be viewed as a measure for mitigating ocean deoxygenation if, and only if, the respective CDR measure itself does not lead to a larger oxygen loss than the reduction in atmospheric CO2 would prevent. We here review the current state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of various marine CDR (mCDR) options onto ocean oxygen, a key ocean state variable and an essential element for all higher forms of marine life. Using results from global model simulations, we show that biotic approaches, such as ocean fertilization, macroalgae cultivation and sinking, and placement of organic matter that is prone to remineralization, can lead to a loss in seawater dissolved oxygen that is 4–40 times larger than the oxygen gain that would result from the CDR-induced reduction in global warming only. Biotic approaches also tend to enhance the amplitude of the diel cycle in dissolved oxygen, with possible physiological impacts specifically in shallow-water environments of coastal vegetated ecosystem. In contrast, geochemical approaches, and biotic approaches that avoid remineralization of biomass within the ocean, may be applied in ways that have minimal impacts on dissolved oxygen. We suggest that impacts on marine oxygen should be accounted for in assessing the suitability of mCDR, and that oxygen should be measured prior to, during and after any research-scale or full-scale implementation activity.",

      "description": "Mesoscale eddies observed in coarse-resolution data typically appear with a single center. However, recent altimetry observations of Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) reveal many eddies own multicore structures. This study investigates the differences between these multicore eddies and single-core eddies and how the multicore eddies are generated. SWOT observation shows that about two-thirds of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies have multiple centers, mainly found in mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and high-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, the geostrophic velocity in multicore eddies is generally higher, through inverse barotropic energy, than in single-core ones. Using LLC4320 simulations, we found that the baroclinic (BC) instability plays a key role in forming these subcenters, and the probability of eddies generating multiple centers decreases during the eddy lifecycle. There are more multicore eddies observed in winter, corresponding to a larger BC growth rate, than in summer. Our study provides new insights into the structure of eddies.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) information holds significant socio-economic value for decision-makers relying on climate variability. While significant advancements have been made in S2S meteorological forecasting, skill variability among prediction systems persists due to differences in physical process representation and technical characteristics of the predictive systems. Traditionally, sub-seasonal systems are considered more informative than seasonal systems within their time horizons, leading to seamless communication approaches that combine systems at fixed horizons, overlooking tailored solutions to optimize forecast skill. This study investigates S2S streamflow forecasting skill across Europe’s diverse hydrological regimes, identifying optimal combination horizons for skill-informed seamless communication. Using bias-adjusted forecasts from ECMWF’s sub-seasonal (ENS-ER) and seasonal (SEAS5) systems, we evaluate streamflow forecasts to uncover spatiotemporal complementarities between the two systems. The results reveal that most European basins benefit from sub-seasonal forecasts up to 3–6 weeks ahead, while steep, snow-dominated mountain ranges, high-precipitation basins, and elevated Mediterranean areas exhibit shorter horizons of 2–4 weeks. Gains in meteorological forecast skill at short lead times (1–3 weeks) are amplified when translated into hydrological processes, extending predictability up to 6 weeks. ENS-ER-based forecasts demonstrate greater spatial homogeneity in skill during shorter lead times, while SEAS5-based forecasts excel at extended horizons. These findings highlight the potential for tailored seamless products to enhance S2S forecast utility. By integrating complementary S2S prediction systems with this diagnostic, region-dependent strategy tailored to diverse hydrological regimes, hydro-climate services can seamlessly deliver accurate, actionable, and operationally relevant information to water- and climate-dependent sectors.",

      "description": "Ozone plays a crucial role in shaping atmospheric environments, and understanding its vertical distribution is essential for deciphering its formation and transport mechanisms. This study integrates ozone lidar observations, WRF-Chem modeling, and meteorological analyses to investigate the monthly and diurnal variations of ozone vertical profiles and its generation and transport mechanisms during a heatwave from July to September 2022 in Guangzhou. Results show that ozone concentrations were primarily confined below 2 km, with significantly higher levels in July compared to August and September, reaching a maximum of 420 μg m−3. WRF-Chem modeling identified photochemical reactions as the dominant driver of ozone formation, with average contributions of 5.9 ppb hr−1, 6.3 ppb hr−1, and 3.7 ppb hr−1 in July, August, and September, respectively. Vertical mixing and convective processes had minimal influence, while advective accumulation became increasingly significant with altitude. Meteorological analyses further indicated that the high temperature and low humidity caused by the subtropical high pressure system further intensified photochemical reactions and promoted ozone production. In addition, the south-westerly winds at the periphery of anticyclone drove ozone transport to downstream areas such as Fujian. This study advances our understanding of ozone vertical profiles and transport dynamics, providing critical insights for developing effective ozone pollution control strategies in the Pearl River Delta region.",

      "description": "Ecosystem water limitation is an important and complicated topic, with soil moisture-driven ecohydrological indicators often yielding contradictory insights into the soils’ impacts on ecosystem water limitation. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of two distinct soil-regulated water limitation regimes in global drylands, distinguishing between ecosystem water limitation regulated by wilting point (WP) and those regulated by critical soil moisture (CSM) threshold for meeting ecosystem water demand. We find systematic differences of these two distinct water limitation regimes across drylands: the more significant the WP effect, the less significant the CSM effect, and vice versa. Climatic aridity, soil texture, root-water uptake depths or all together drive the divergence between two types of ecosystem water limitations at regional scale, and soil texture play a dominant role. Sand and clay soils drive ecosystem productivity fluctuations by increased water limitations, albeit through different pathways: clay soils correspond to a more significant water limitation as WP contribution rather than CSM, while sandy soils are the opposite. In this study, the framework of decoupling the differential effects of soil on ecosystem water limitation was re-developed by integrating WP and CSM into ecological drought monitoring and assessment.",

      "description": "The frequency of extreme drought events is increasing, significantly impacting ecosystems worldwide. In China, the grasslands of dryland Inner Mongolia provide a vital ecological resource, highlight the urgent need to understand their response to drought in these arid regions. We investigate vegetation dynamics and soil moisture fluctuations across three grassland types—meadows, typical grasslands, and desert grasslands—utilizing solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil moisture data from 2001 to 2020. By employing event coincidence analysis and the maximum coincidence rate, we quantified the grasslands’ responses to drought events. Our findings indicate a significant upward trend in SIF across all grassland types over the past two decades, while NDVI and soil moisture levels remained relatively stable. Under drought conditions, the probability of grassland degradation ranged from 40% to 60%. Notably, desert grasslands exhibited a considerably slower response rate compared to other grassland types, while meadow grasslands responded the fastest to drought; however, all grassland types displayed a response delay of 1–2 months. When soil moisture levels fell below −1.8 standard deviations (STDs), a reversal in grassland response patterns was observed, particularly in meadow grasslands, which showed a substantial increase in response probability. At soil moisture levels below −2.4 STD, this probability stabilized at approximately 90%, significantly higher than that of other grassland types. These insights provide a vital basis for understanding and mitigating drought impacts on resilient grassland ecosystems under climate change.",

However, long-term impacts of SF on vegetation and the underlying mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct spatial (Impact versus Control zones) and temporal (pre- versus post- development of utility-scale SF) comparisons of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate vegetation variations in three ground-mounted utility-scale SF (with an average installed capacity of 8263 MW) in northwest China. Results indicate SF impacts on vegetation within an extent of around 1 km. Both spatial and temporal comparisons reveal positive SF impacts on vegetation, with higher NDVI in Impact (0.098) than Control zones (0.076) as well as during post- (0.113) than pre-SF development (0.087). Further quantification based on random forest shows generally equivalent contribution of climatic factors and SF construction on vegetation greening (48.4% and 51.6% respectively). These findings underscore substantial influence of SF on vegetation in non-humid conditions, and raise an urgent need to further explore its potential eco-environmental implications on a broader scale.",

      "description": "China has implemented stringent emission controls to reduce PM2.5 pollution, but the impact of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on regional heavy pollution events in this process remains understudied. We use the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modeling system to innovatively reconstruct the meteorologically-driven trends of PM2.5 pollution in Beijing from 2013 to 2023 by setting up fixed emission scenarios and minimize the interference of anthropogenic emissions. The results show that the heavy pollution frequency (HPF) in Beijing in winter is significantly correlated with the intensity of ENSO (r = 0.72, p < 0.05): the intensity of El Niño events is positively correlated with the HPF, and the intensity of La Niña events is negatively correlated with the HPF. Further analysis reveals that ENSO triggers anomalous 850 hPa southerly winds and 500 hPa northwesterly winds mainly through coupling with the East Asian Winter Monsoon, thus altering the low-level warm and humid transport and mid-level diffusion conditions. In addition, the ENSO-driven trans-regional transport also led to the formation of distinct spatial distribution patterns of pollution between Beijing and Tianjin–Tangshan areas.",

      "description": "Crop water productivity (CWP) metrics can reveal how the dynamics of crop production and water use change across space and time. We use field-scale satellite inputs from 2016–2021 to estimate potential water savings for four crops (almonds, grapes, walnuts, and citrus—which collectively account for approximately one-third of California’s cropland area), within critically overdrafted groundwater sub-basins of California’s San Joaquin Valley. These annual estimates of field-level water savings potential are based on locally achievable CWP values for each crop type. Our findings show considerable spatial variation in CWP and potential water savings within each sub-basin. We find that increasing CWP to peak efficiency (defined as improving fields to the 95th percentile of observed CWP) for four crops could meet up to 36% of the estimated annual overdraft in San Joaquin Valley. For comparison, fallowing 5% of the four crop type fields in the same study area could potentially reduce annual overdraft by 11%. By delivering results at the field scale, our work can inform targeted interventions by irrigation district managers and more efficient allocation of state incentives for improved water management. For example, we estimate that state grant funding for water efficiency upgrades could have amplified potential water savings threefold by targeting investments to the least efficient fields.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Where cattle production expands into natural ecosystems, it typically leads to stark social–ecological impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity losses, and ecosystem degradation. This is particularly the case in South America’s tropical forests and savannas, where much hope is placed in intensifying cattle production instead of further expanding it. Yet, where such an intensification is already happening and how it is associated with deforestation patterns remains elusive. Here, we pioneer the use of satellite imagery to identify areas where cattle are confined—a key indicator of intensified cattle production—across the entire 3.7 million km2 South American dry diagonal; a global hotspot of cattle production and deforestation. We subsequently use an active-learning approach to separate these confinement areas into (1) feedlots, (2) concentrated animal feeding operations, and (3) supplementary feeding areas. Our results show that confinement areas are ubiquitous in the dry diagonal. We identified 253 large, industrialized feedlots and more than 3200 medium-sized concentrated animal feeding operations—together containing an estimated 13 million cattle head—and more than 4000 supplementary feeding sites on pastures. Feedlots were found mostly in the Cerrado (n = 141), followed by Chaco (n = 93), and were less frequent in the Chiquitano and Caatinga regions. Feedlots occurred predominantly in areas of high cropland cover and low levels of deforestation, while supplementary feeding sites were associated with higher shares of deforestation. Independent validation suggests our methodology can identify confinement areas robustly (97% user’s accuracy) and separate feedlots, concentrated animal feeding operations, and supplementary feeding sites accurately (F1-score 0.91 ± 0.01). Thus, our scalable approach has the potential to provide an advancement in our understanding of the distribution of cattle production systems, the geography of ranching intensification, the environmental impacts of beef production, and the relationship between ranching intensification and tropical deforestation.",

The responses of the amplitude and occurrence frequency of the eight MJO phases are broadly stronger and higher during the weak TBO when compared to the strong TBO.

Multiple crises threaten the sustainability of our societies and pose at risk the planetary boundaries, hence requiring usable and operational knowledge. Natural-language processing tools facilitate data collection, extraction and analysis processes. They expand knowledge utilization capabilities by improving access to reliable sources in shorter time. They also identify patterns of similarities and contrasts across diverse contexts. We apply general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) to two case studies and we document appropriate uses and shortcomings of these tools for two tasks: classification and sentiment analysis of climate and sustainability documents. We study both statistical and prompt-based methods. In the first case study, we use LLMs to assess whether climate pledges trigger cascade effects in other sustainability dimensions. In the second use case, we use LLMs to identify interactions between the sustainable development goals and detects the direction of their links to frame meaningful policy implications. We find that LLMs are successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data helping practitioners and researchers accessing. LLMs detect strong concerns from emerging economies in addressing food security, water security and urban challenges as primary issues. Developed economies, instead, focus their pledges on the energy transition and climate finance. We also detect and document four main limits along the knowledge production chain: interpretability, external validity, replicability and usability. These risks threaten the usability of findings and can lead to failures in the decision-making process. We recommend risk mitigation strategies to improve transparency and literacy on artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to complex policy problems. Our work presents a critical but empirically grounded application of LLMs to climate and sustainability questions and suggests avenues to further expand controlled and risk-aware AI-powered computational social sciences.",

In contrast, the southeastern United States exhibits early-stage declines, though vulnerability to extreme weather is growing. A latitude-time analysis reveals asymmetric hemispheric trajectories, driven by distinct climate dynamics and anthropogenic influences. The transition from systemic temperature-influenced hotspots to localized, extreme event-influenced phenomena underscores the intensifying impact of extreme climate events. These findings provide critical insights into the spatial and temporal evolution of climate change impacts and highlight the necessity of region-specific adaptation strategies.",

      "description": "Virtual water trade (VWT) links local water withdrawal (WW) with distant consumption. Given the significant contradictions between China’s water demand and supply, it is urgent to clarify the responsibilities for WW (RWW) in VWT. Previous studies considering this responsibility have focused solely on the absolute volume of WW; however, the disparities in water availability and economic capacity lead to differing implications of the same WW action across regions. Here, to reassess the RWW, we introduce water scarcity index and value-added to WW and propose the concept of the three-dimensional water footprint (3DWF). We reveal the distribution distinction between WW and 3DWF among China’s regions. In addition, we explore how the 3DWF is transferred within the supply chain and further reveal its inequality and the contributions of regions to the inequality. We find that the distribution of 3DWF has changed dramatically compared to WW, primarily concentrating in China’s economic center. The 3DWF inequality primarily results from the distribution of 3DWF-local, with a Gini coefficient of 0.7556. Xinjiang has only 1.8% of the population but is responsible for 22% of the 3DWF-local in China and has become the largest contributor to the inequality. Notably, this inequality is mitigated when 3DWF-non-local is taken into account. Our findings provide new insights into the establishment of rigid constraints and the sustainable spatial deployment of water resources.",
