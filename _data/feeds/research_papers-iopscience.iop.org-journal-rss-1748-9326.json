      "title": "Unraveling drought propagation dynamics using causal inference from time series",

      "description": "Drought is a pervasive natural hazard that propagates through the hydrologic cycle, leading to water deficiencies across key hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture. However, understanding the intricate dynamics of drought propagation remains challenging because of spatiotemporal variability and interactions among multiple drought types, including meteorological drought (MD), agricultural drought (AD), and hydrological drought (HD). Traditional analytical methods struggle to capture these complexities, particularly when using high-dimensional time series data characterized by nonlinear causality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cause–effect-based framework that integrates the process-based Community Land Model (CLM5), a causal inference method (Peter–Clark momentary conditional independence (PCMCI)-CMIsymb), and causal effect (CE) analysis to investigate drought propagation across multiple time scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. CLM5 provides high-resolution spatiotemporal drought estimations, PCMCI-CMIsymb detects nonlinear causal relationships, and CE analysis quantifies propagation probabilities across varying time lags. The results demonstrate that (a) drought propagation patterns vary by time scale, with short-term (1 month) propagation occurring primarily from MD to AD, whereas long-term (12 month) propagation extends from MD to both AD and HD; (b) subregional HDs tend to influence each other across regions, with stronger interconnections observed at long-term time scales; and (c) the likelihood of drought propagation differs spatially, with higher probabilities of MD propagation into AD and HD in the middle and lower YRB at the 6 month time scale, mostly peaking at 40%–60% with a 1 month lag. This study presents an advanced analytical framework for drought assessment, providing insights for improving drought mitigation and water resource management, particularly in regions affected by spatial hydroclimatic variability.",

      "title": "Maritime continent aerosols reinforce the MJO propagation barrier under El Niño conditions",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae1754",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The Maritime Continent (MC), a critical region for Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) propagation, is also a global hotspot for biomass burning aerosol emissions. While the barrier effect on MJO propagation over the MC is well documented, the role of aerosols in this process and its underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. Combining observations, reanalysis datasets and moisture budget diagnostics, this study demonstrates that absorbing aerosols from El Niño-enhanced wildfires significantly modulate MJO eastward propagation. During the boreal autumn (August–November), the peak season for aerosol loading, El Niño-induced subsidence over the MC exacerbates regional dryness and promotes widespread wildfires, further elevating aerosol concentrations. To isolate the aerosol impact from El Niño effects, we classified the MJO events under high- and low-aerosol conditions while controlling for similar Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies. Composite analyses reveal that the high aerosol loads disrupt the propagation of MJO convective envelopes, whereas MJO sustains eastward propagation under low-aerosol conditions. Mechanistically, enhanced shortwave absorption by elevated aerosols induces a boundary layer cold anomaly that suppresses low-level convergence, while simultaneous heating of the lower-to-mid troposphere enhances atmospheric stability. This combined thermal and thermodynamic effect weakens boundary layer moisture anomalies, inhibiting the development of shallow convection east of the MJO deep convection that is essential for sustained propagation. The findings highlight the overlooked role of MC aerosols in the MJO barrier effect via aerosol-radiation-convection interactions, suggesting that improved representation of aerosols in climate models may enhance MJO predictability.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "The high seas comprise nearly half the Earth’s surface and the 2023 United Nations Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction agreement renewed efforts to better manage this vast area. Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) are tasked with a UN dual-mandate to ensure the (1) long-term conservation of fish stocks and their associated ecosystems while managing the (2) sustainable use of high seas fisheries. Building on a previous analysis, we developed 10 questions each for our 10 categories (e.g. catch targets, transparency, bycatch). These 100 questions were both descriptive (e.g. are there quantitative results of bycatch improvement?) while others indicated intent (e.g. are there plans to rebuild all declining stocks?) and used publicly available information to evaluate 16 RFMOs (with a score of 0, 0.5, or 1). The average score for all RFMOs out of 100 was 46 (max 61.5, min 29.5). There were six questions for which all RFMOs received a 0, 90 questions for which at least one RFMO scored a one, and a ‘best case’ score of 76.5 that aggregated the highest RFMO score across the 10 categories. This indicates a competence gap; no RFMO is achieving what is empirically documented as possible in one RFMO or another. We also analyzed satellite-derived fishing activity and target stock status. Five RFMO convention areas had the highest overall and density of fishing effort. On average, 56% of stocks targeted in RFMO convention areas were considered overexploited or collapsed. We did not find that RFMO scores were correlated with better management outcomes (i.e. target stock status and fishing effort). However, we found correlations between better target stock status and questions assessing protected area adoption, banning transshipment at-sea, and reducing allowable catches in response to overfishing—policies that few RFMOs have fully adopted. These findings indicate ways for RFMOs to improve high seas fisheries management that are immediately available and effective.",

      "title": "Increasing crop rotation diversity with cover crops builds climate resilience on farms",
      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae1c53",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Farms in the US Midwest are experiencing disruptive heavy rainfall during the spring planting window and more intense droughts during the summer growing season. Recent analyses of field experiments suggest that increasing crop rotational complexity (RC) builds resilience to climate change, especially when rotations include overwintering cover crops that assimilate and retain nutrients and increase organic matter inputs to soil. However, evidence from working farms is lacking. We used field-scale remote sensing to assess relationships between crop diversification and agroecosystem climate resilience from 2008 to 2019 in Michigan, the most agriculturally diverse state in the US Midwest. Using panel fixed effects models and linear regressions, we assessed how corn and soybean yield and temporal yield stability (measured as the coefficient of variation) respond to: (1) an index of crop RC that encompasses species turnover and functional diversity, and (2) replacing bare fallows with winter cover crops. We also tested how cover crops influence corn and soybean planting dates as an indicator of resilience to heavy spring rainfall. We found that crop diversification was linked to higher corn and soybean yields, but cover crops showed more promise for improving yield stability than overall RC. Cover crops reduced planting delays associated with heavy spring rainfall, and did not interfere with primary crop planting under average weather conditions. However, cover crop benefits for resilience took multiple years to appear on farms, highlighting the importance of technical and financial support during the early phases of transition. Together these findings may promote cover crop adoption by reducing concerns that cover crops interfere with primary crop planting, and instead showing that they are a crucial tool for minimizing risk from increasingly variable and extreme climatic conditions.",

      "link": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae1e13",
      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Existing evidence on the societal impacts of heatwaves has largely centered on human health and labor productivity. This study contributes new evidence to this body of literature by showing that heatwaves significantly reduce human mobility, a high-frequency indicator of economic activity and social interaction, in and between Chinese cities. Using a set of fixed-effects panel-regression models estimated with mobile phone-derived human mobility data, coupled with daily meteorological and air quality data, we find that heatwaves, on average, reduce the intracity trip rate and inbound trips in Chinese cities by 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Notably, nearly one-third of the heatwave-induced decline in the intracity trip rate can be attributed to the added effect of sustained periods of extreme heat beyond the temperature–mobility relationship. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on these estimates suggest that the 2023 Chinese summer heatwave led to nationwide mobility reductions on a scale equivalent to suspending all intracity and inbound trips in Shanghai, one of China’s largest and busiest cities, for an entire week. Moreover, the adverse impacts of heatwaves on human mobility are particularly pronounced in cities of small size and with limited economic resources and green spaces, highlighting the urgent need to enhance the heatwave resilience of these cities.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Is democratic governance a key driver of environmental policy in the agricultural sector? We address this question using a global dataset covering national-level agri-environmental policies and regime transitions between autocracy and democracy from 1961 to 2021. Our empirical strategy employs a difference-in-differences estimator within an event-study framework to identify the causal impact of democratization on the adoption of agri-environmental policy measures. The results show that democratic transitions lead to a significant increase in the adoption of such policies. In the short to medium run (within six years), democratization causes a +25% increase in the number of agri-environmental policies compared to a counterfactual scenario under autocracy. In the long run, this effect persists and is likely to grow further. These newly implemented policies predominantly address biodiversity protection, fertilizer use, forest conservation, and soil erosion. We find no systematic evidence of heterogeneous effects among democracies based on characteristics such as government type, electoral system, levels of political corruption, or international integration. The relevance of these findings is heightened by current global political developments, as many democracies are experiencing institutional backsliding. Future research should directly examine how such developments influence the adoption of environmental policies.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Shanxi Province, a major hub of coal production and industrial activity in China, faces severe PM2.5 pollution and complex co-emission sources that challenge air quality monitoring. This study developed multiple machine learning models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in 2022 by integrating ground-based PM2.5 observations, Himawari-8 measurements, CO, NO2 and ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) derived from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and ERA5. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that incorporating TROPOMI-derived CO, NO2 and UVAI produced the highest predictive performance, reducing root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 14% and 16% respectively. Meanwhile, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and partial dependence analysis identified CO as the most important species driving PM2.5 prediction, with all three variables showing positive contributions to PM2.5 that increased with higher values. This emphasis on the importance of CO and NO2 is physically realistic given that CO is co-emitted with primary aerosols, and NO2 is a secondary aerosol precursor. However, such work has not been previously considered by the community focusing on surface PM2.5 prediction using AI models and satellite observations. The model revealed pronounced spatiotemporal gradients in PM2.5 across Shanxi, peaking in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year (62.0 μg m−3), and minimizing in summer (21.0 μg m−3), while remaining persistently high in southern and eastern industrial regions. The steady PM2.5 rise in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year, suggesting that pre-holiday production activities may contribute to short-term emission intensification, while demonstrating that traditional season-based analysis approaches may miss these extremes. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multi-sensor satellite observations with interpretable machine learning for characterizing pollution dynamics in complex industrial regions.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Climate change has profoundly altered the timing of phenological events, disrupting ecosystem functions and carbon dynamics. However, photosynthetic duration is often overestimated, particularly in autumn, as greenness and photosynthesis tend to decouple. This highlights the need for a more precise understanding of autumn photosynthetic phenology to refine global carbon assessments. In this study, we estimated the end-of-photosynthesis date (EOP) across the Northern Hemisphere (>30° N) from 2001 to 2021 using satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and flux tower observations. We then analyzed EOP’s spatiotemporal variations and identified its primary biome-specific drivers. Our results reveal a widespread advancement of EOP, except in water-limited biomes, with the most pronounced shifts in colder regions such as boreal forests and tundra. These shifts are mainly driven by the carryover effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming, which are likely influenced by leaf lifespan and sink capacity. Nutrient limitation may further exacerbate sink constraints, particularly in colder biomes. The effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming counteract the delaying influence of late-season warming on EOP. The significant advancement of early-stage EOP (EOP75) indicates that early-season drivers have a stronger effect than late-season delays, while late-stage EOP (EOP25) remains nearly unchanged due to a balance of opposing forces. Consequently, the limited photosynthetic gains from an earlier or unchanged EOP may fail to offset respiratory carbon losses, potentially weakening the Northern Hemisphere’s carbon sink capacity and complicating future carbon-climate feedback projections.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "Groundwater, the largest accessible store of freshwater, plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems and supporting human activities. Increasing water demands and climate variability, however, are accelerating the exploitation of this resource in many regions, often beyond environmentally sustainable limits. In this study, we present the first global-scale assessment of sustainable groundwater head declines, defined as the maximum permissible drop in groundwater head that avoids environmental harm. With a global-scale hydrological-groundwater model coupling (VIC-WUR-MODFLOW) at 5 arcmin resolution, we simulated groundwater discharge and head under natural conditions. Using these values, we isolated mean groundwater levels during low-flow, intermediate-flow, and high-flow periods to estimate historic sustainable groundwater head declines. We compared our estimates with observations and simulations to assess the historic sustainability of groundwater use practices. Globally, the median sustainable groundwater head decline was 4.5 m between 1984–2018. Tropical regions (e.g. Amazon Basin, southeast Asia) exhibited greater sustainably available groundwater due to high recharge, while arid regions (e.g. western United States, South Africa) exhibited limited capacities. Comparisons with historic groundwater head revealed that several key agricultural regions (e.g. Indo-Gangetic Plain, North China Plain, Central Valley) exceeded sustainable limits by more than 20 m, corresponding to overexploitations of sustainable resources by more than 150%. In contrast, much of Europe and North America remained within sustainable boundaries when assessed at the aquifer-scale, although localized overexploitation was still evident. We also identified emerging hotspots (e.g. Iran, northern Africa) where groundwater head declines approached sustainable thresholds over the study period. As freshwater demands continue to rise, these regions may become future hotspots of unsustainable groundwater use without intervention. This study provides a novel global methodology to quantify environmentally sustainable groundwater resources, offering insight into at-risk regions and supporting informed water resources management under future pressures.",

      "pubDate": "",
      "description": "As the fastest growing energy source in the United States, utility scale solar energy (USSE) features prominently in the scientific literature, particularly regarding the ‘lake effect hypothesis’, which posits that water birds perceive USSE as water bodies, are subsequently attracted to them, and experience mortality as a result. Policymakers and environmental regulators rely on research to evaluate and publicly disclose the impacts of emerging technologies on wildlife and to craft appropriate avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures. We completed a literature review and summarized data from two papers to better understand how technology type influences conclusions regarding bird mortality at USSE facilities. We found 16 papers addressing bird mortality at USSE primarily from the United States where authors pooled data across fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker panel photovoltaic (PV) facilities, despite fixed-tilt facilities trending substantially downward in installed capacity in the U.S. in the last 10 years. Our summary revealed that data to support the lake effect hypothesis is sparse when data from fixed-tilt panel facilities developed prior to the commercial transition to anti-reflective coating (ARC) are separated from tracker panel facilities. A dataset from a single fixed-tilt PV facility built prior to the ARC transition was used in eight papers and cited by 14 of the 16 papers that discussed aquatic bird mortality. This single dataset underpins the entire lake effect hypothesis discussion in the scientific literature. Despite this facility being unrepresentative of current USSE facilities, conclusions drawn from these data have been broadly applied to all PV USSE facilities. Overall, our findings show that it is important for researchers to separate data by technology type, and for regulators to understand that avian mortality trends associated with older solar facilities might not be applicable to modern USSE installations.",

      "description": "As cities in sub-Saharan Africa become more crowded, noise pollution is also emerging as an important environmental concern, after air pollution. Yet, unlike air pollution, which is enjoying relatively more public attention, there is limited measurement data and policy efforts on environmental noise pollution. We followed a recent city-wide measurement approach used in Accra (Ghana) and characterized environmental noise patterns in Kigali, a contrasting city with very different topography and regulatory system than Accra to inform urban policy. We established 10 ‘fixed’ (yearlong) and 120 ‘rotating’ (weeklong) monitoring sites to capture both the temporal and spatial patterns in Kigali’s sound environment. The measurement occurred between November 2022 and December 2023, and samples were collected at 1 min interval, resulting in 5155 014 (3580 site-days) and 1190 620 (827 site-days) site-minutes of valid data from the fixed and rotating sites, respectively. The 130 monitoring sites covered a variety of geographic and land-use factors across diverse neighborhoods and sources. We computed several noise metrics, including 1 h (LAeq1 h), daily (LAeq24 h), day-time (Lday), and night-time (Lnight). Daily noise (LAeq24 h) levels across the city ranged between 38 dBA and 85 dBA. Commercial, business, and industrial (CBI) and high-density residential (HD) communities experienced the highest noise levels, with some sites constantly above 70 dBA at day and 65 dBA at night. About 63% of our observed day-time values (up to ∼72% in some areas) exceeded the Rwandan day-time standard (55 dBA) for residential areas, whereas 69% of the observed night-time values (up to 80% in some areas) exceeded the corresponding night-time standard (45 dBA). In Nyarugenge, the most urbanized district, as much as 75% of our site-days data exceeded day-time standard. However diurnal patterns throughout the city were similar, rising from ∼5 am, peaking at about 8 am and plateauing until 6 pm before falling to their lowest at midnight. Overall, noise levels in the city did not vary much by day of the week, weekdays vs weekend, or dry vs wet seasons. Environmental noise in Kigali often exceeded both Rwandan standards and international guidelines, with residents in the city center district, CBI and HD areas at risk of higher exposure, and hence higher risk of adverse effects. Detailed assessment of the sources, at-risk population, and associated health effects may inform Rwandan’s environmental policy efforts and city initiatives in the face of the ongoing urban growth and densification.",
