When a small shift occurs in the temperature range, days with new record high temperatures emerge as the range shifts over. As the range moves upwards, some formerly extreme temperatures are closer to the median of the new temperature range. Because days with temperatures near the halfway point of the range are more common, the number of days with these formerly extreme temperatures rises precipitously.</p><div class=\"responsive-embed-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><div class=\"responsive-embed\"></div></div><p><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Video: Gerald Meehl (NCAR) on high temperatures beating lows. </span></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHRiCCkGaOQ\" style=\"font-size: 13.008px; line-height: 20.0063px;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Youtube</span></em></a></p><p>The hottest days and nights have become <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GL040736/abstract\">more intense and more frequent since 1950</a>, and there has been an <a href=\"http://climatenexus.org/learn/extreme-weather/heat-and-cold-0\">increase in the intensity, duration and frequency of extreme heat events</a>.  The Third US National Climate Assessment <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/nca2014/low/NCA3_Full_Report_01_Overview_Report_Findings_LowRes.pdf\">confirms these trends</a>, finding that, “Prolonged periods of high temperatures and the persistence of high nighttime temperatures have increased in many locations (especially in urban areas) over the past half century.” By the middle of this century, people in the US can expect a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n7/full/nclimate2631.html\">fourfold to sixfold increase</a> in the number of days exceeding 95°F (35°C) under the IPCC’s <a href=\"https://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/emission_scenarios.php\">A2 emissions scenario</a>.</p><p>This pattern of a rising ratio of record hot temperatures to record low temperatures has been documented elsewhere, as illustrated in a recent Washington Post story about Australia, “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/09/the-simple-statistic-that-perfectly-captures-what-climate-change-means/\">The simple statistic that perfectly captures what climate change means</a>.”</p><p>The global area experiencing extreme summer temperatures has grown well <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/37/E2415.full\">over ten times larger over the past 30 years</a>. In the past several years, the global area hit by extremely hot summertime temperatures has <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/07/30/1205276109.abstract\">increased 50-fold</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/37/E2415.full\">fingerprint of global warming</a> has been firmly identified in these trends.</p><p>A small change in the average global temperature has a major impact. At the end of the last ice age, when the northeastern United States was covered by more than 3,000 feet of ice, average temperatures were only 5 ̊F to 9 ̊F cooler than today. During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 55 million years ago, when crocodiles and palm trees lived above the Arctic Circle, the average global temperature was only <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/whats-hottest-earths-ever-been\">8 ̊F to 13 ̊F warmer than today</a>. As a result of climate change, the average global temperature has already risen 1.4 ̊F and is set to rise by more than 9 ̊F by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue on a business-as-usual course.</p><p>Even though the average global temperature is steadily rising, it is still possible to see extremely cold days, though they are becoming increasingly uncommon and the most extreme cold temperatures are becoming very rare. A cold snap that breaks records, while increasingly uncommon, can still occur, as the range of natural variation for local spot temperatures is very large when compared to the length of modern record-keeping. For example, a cold event that qualifies as a once-in-500-year event under the current climate may be colder than any event that was recorded during the prior climate, as modern record keeping often only goes back 100 years (or less) for many locations.</p><p>The ratio of record highs to record lows over the last 365 days provides a snapshot look at climate change. However, year to year variability in the climate system is large. In 2012, the ratio of hot to cold records was about 6 to 1; in 2013, it was less than 1 to 1. From 2000 to 2010, the ratio was an average of 2 to 1. NOAA tracks and provides counts for daily weather records <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records\">here</a>, including record low and high temperatures.</p><p>Atmospheric temperatures still swing between “cold” and “hot” years, even as they now trend warmer on average. This is because of natural variation in the climate system, as heat cycles between the atmosphere and the ocean through phenomena such as El Niño. Heat records are more likely to be broken when natural variation runs in the same direction as global warming. When the two are out of sync, it is more likely that temperatures will be average or even a little below average. Therefore, the rising trend in the ratio of record highs to record lows is clearest when looking over decades.</p><p>The rising global temperatures and prolonged periods of extreme heat not only affect ecosystems and infrastructure but also have direct implications for human health. Among the lesser-discussed impacts is the deterioration of potency in men (<a href=\"https://wecantgobackwards.org.uk/sexual-health/erectile-dysfunction/\">link</a>), which some studies link to prolonged heat exposure and its effects on vascular health and hormone regulation. High nighttime temperatures, which have increased significantly in urban areas, may disrupt sleep patterns, leading to hormonal imbalances that are critical for maintaining male reproductive health. Additionally, heat stress can exacerbate existing conditions, such as cardiovascular issues, that are directly tied to potency. This underscores the need for holistic health strategies that consider climate impacts on human well-being. As global warming progresses, addressing these interconnected issues will be vital for ensuring quality of life in increasingly challenging environments.</p><p>Looking ahead, under a moderate rising emissions scenario, the ratio of record high maximum to record low minimum temperatures in the US is <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GL040736/full\">projected to continue to increase</a>, with ratios of about 20 to 1 by mid-century and roughly 50 to 1 by the end of the century.</p><h3><strong>Resources</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/recent-us-temperature-trends\">Recent U.S. temperature trends</a>, NCA</li><li><a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/record-highs-vs-record-lows\">Record highs vs. record lows</a>, Climate Central</li><li><a href=\"https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/news/1036/record-high-temperatures-far-outpace-record-lows-across-us\">Record high temperatures far outpace record lows across U.S.</a>, UCAR</li><li><a href=\"http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/high-low-temps.html#fragment-2\">High and low temperature indicator</a>, US EPA</li></ul><h3><strong>Widget Embed Code</strong></h3><p>The \"Tracking Climate Change\" widget is freely available to embed on your site in both a light and dark theme:</p><ul><li>Light theme: <br /><br /><em><iframe src=\"http://www.climatenexus.org/sites/default/tools/temprecords/?embed=true&theme=light\" style=\"width:500px;height:500px;max-width:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\"></iframe></em></li><li>Dark theme:<br /><br /><em><iframe src=\"http://www.climatenexus.org/sites/default/tools/temprecords/?embed=true\" style=\"width:500px;height:500px;max-width:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\"></iframe></em></li></ul></div>\n      \n<!-- END CUSTOM TEMPLATE OUTPUT from 'themes/custom/climate_signals/templates/system/field.html.twig' -->\n\n\n\n<!-- THEME DEBUG -->\n<!-- THEME HOOK: 'field' -->\n<!-- FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS:\n   ▪️ field--node--field-embed-check--real-time-data.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--node--field-embed-check.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--node--real-time-data.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--field-embed-check.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--text-long.html.twig\n   ✅ field.html.twig\n-->\n<!-- 💡 BEGIN CUSTOM TEMPLATE OUTPUT from 'themes/custom/climate_signals/templates/system/field.html.twig' -->\n\n\n\n  <div class=\"field-name-field-embed-check\">\n    <div>Embed Check</div>\n              <div></div>\n          </div>\n\n<!-- END CUSTOM TEMPLATE OUTPUT from 'themes/custom/climate_signals/templates/system/field.html.twig' -->\n\n\n\n<!-- THEME DEBUG -->\n<!-- THEME HOOK: 'links__node' -->\n<!-- FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS:\n   ▪️ links--node.html.twig\n   ✅ links.html.twig\n-->\n<!-- BEGIN OUTPUT from 'core/modules/system/templates/links.html.twig' -->\n\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/system/templates/links.html.twig' -->\n\n\n\n<!-- THEME DEBUG -->\n<!-- THEME HOOK: 'field' -->\n<!-- FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS:\n   ▪️ field--node--field-promote-to-rss-feed--real-time-data.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--node--field-promote-to-rss-feed.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--node--real-time-data.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--field-promote-to-rss-feed.html.twig\n   ▪️ field--boolean.html.twig\n   ✅ field.html.twig\n-->\n<!-- 💡 BEGIN CUSTOM TEMPLATE OUTPUT from 'themes/custom/climate_signals/templates/system/field.html.twig' -->\n\n\n\n  <div class=\"field-name-field-promote-to-rss-feed\">\n    <div>Promote to RSS feed</div>\n              <div>Off</div>\n          </div>\n\n<!-- END CUSTOM TEMPLATE OUTPUT from 'themes/custom/climate_signals/templates/system/field.html.twig' -->",

In Malawi, a country of 20 million, UNICEF estimates 9 million people, half of them children, need help as a result of the drought. At least 2.7 million across Zimbabwe are officially threatened with hunger — a number expected to increase after the completion of nationwide crop assessment. In Mangwe, 39 year-old Zanyiwe Ncube, told the AP she would usually be harvesting crops for her two children and niece, but this year “We have nothing in the fields, not a single grain...\" Because of the drought, \"Everything has been burnt.\"  Traditional leader Joseph Nleya, 77, told the AP these are the hottest, driest, and most desperate conditions he can remember. \"Dams have no water, riverbeds are dry and boreholes are few. We were relying on wild fruits, but they have also dried up ...Hunger is turning otherwise hard-working people into criminals.\" </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom:

Of the 134 nations for which sufficient data were available, just 10 countries — mostly islands, Australia, and Finland and Estonia — met the World Health Organization's standards of less than 5 micrograms of fine particulate pollution (known as PM2.5) per cubic meter of air. Most of the worst polluted countries were in Asia. PM2.5 pollution leads to millions of premature deaths every year, more than any other type of pollution. The US EPA recently proposed strengthening its standard from 12 to nine micrograms per cubic meter. “Air pollution and climate change both have the same culprit, which is fossil fuels,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir’s North American division, told the New York Times.

The disruption to global shipping is compounded by the dramatic reduction of shipping through the Suez Canal caused by missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
