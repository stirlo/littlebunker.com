  "description": "Nature Climate Change is a monthly journal dedicated to publishing high-quality research papers that describe the most significant and cutting-edge research on the causes, impacts and wider implications of global climate change. The journal publishes climate research across the physical, biological and social sciences and strives to integrate and communicate interdisciplinary research. The journal aims to play a leading role in: providing accessibility to a broad audience to research published both within and outside the journal; raising the visibility of climate change research in related research communities as well as the mainstream media; and offering a forum for discussion of the challenges faced by researchers and policy makers (and other interested parties) in understanding the complex mechanisms and impacts associated with the Earth’s changing climate.",

Here researchers show it is rooted in the structural limitation of states and discuss future research directions to promote the emergence of transformative states.",

Now, an integrated analysis of land and ocean net primary production for 2003–2021 reveals that land and ocean net primary production show contrasting trends. Enhanced biospheric primary production is predominantly driven by an increase over land, partially offset by an oceanic decrease.",
